2759022,R v Doug McDonald [2012] NSWSC 875,"Judgment

1.On 13 April 2012, the accused, Doug McDonald, was arraigned before me on an indictment alleging that on 12 November 2010 at Nelson Bay in the State of New South Wales he did murder Bruce McDonald. To that indictment the accused pleaded not guilty.

2.Pursuant to s132 of the Criminal Procedure Act, the accused, on 17 November 2011, had made an election that his trial be conducted by judge alone. The accused's election, signed by him and also signed by the Crown and dated 17 November 2011, was placed before me at the start of the trial.

3.The accused has raised a defence of mental illness within the meaning of Part 4 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.

4.My attention has been drawn in particular to s 37 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act (1990), which sets out an obligation on the part of a trial judge to explain to a jury a number of matters which are enumerated in the section. I, of course, am sitting without a jury, as I have indicated, but lest there be any doubt about the matter, I have taken into account the provisions of s 37.

5.Those provisions were conveniently summarised by Hall J in R v Coleman [2010] NSWSC 177 at paragraphs 69 and following. His Honour said:

""The legal and practical consequences of a finding that the accused is not guilty on the ground of mental illness may be shortly stated. 

The statute which governs cases like this, namely, s 39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, requires me to consider making an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice, this means not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release him, but also that he becomes what is known as a forensic patient, and falls under the supervision of a body called the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

The Mental Health Review Tribunal consists of a president and his or her deputy, who must be a lawyer. It also consists of two other persons, one of whom must be a psychiatrist, and the third member is a person who has suitable qualifications or experience for the task.

The tribunal is required to review the accused's case as soon as practicable after an order is made for his detention in strict custody. The tribunal may make orders as to his continued detention, care or treatment, or as to his release.

The tribunal cannot make an order for the release of the accused unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person, or any member of the public, would not be seriously endangered by his release.

The Minister for Health and the Attorney-General may appear before the tribunal, or make submissions to the tribunal, in relation to the possible release of the accused.

Where an order for release is not made, the tribunal orders result in continued detention, care and treatment in a place and in a manner specified by the tribunal.

After the initial review, the tribunal must, at least once every six months, again review the case and make orders as to the accused's continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison, or other place, or as to his release.

If release is ordered, then it may be on conditions or it may be unconditional. If any condition is breached, or where the mental condition of the accused has deteriorated, so that he may be a serious danger to others, a further order may be made by the tribunal for his apprehension, care and detention.

The conditions which could be prescribed include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication, appointments with health care professionals, enrolment in education and therapeutic programs to ensure that the accused is properly cared for.

Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions caring for forensic patients.

Security conditions (as necessary) are in place while the accused is detained in hospital, prison or other place, or if he is allowed to be temporarily absent from the place of detention.

The accused may be released from these restrictions if given an unconditional release, or where released on conditions and those conditions have expired over time.

However, as I have previously explained, the accused will only ever be released when the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered.""

6.I have taken into account all of those matters, in the manner in which I am required to do by s 37.

7.In addition, I am mindful of the provisions of s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act which govern the verdict of a judge in a judge alone trial, and in particular, s 133(3) which provides that if any act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.

8.To the extent that that provision captures the provisions of s 37 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act (1990), I record the fact again that I have taken the provisions of s 37 into account.

9.The Crown case against the accused is contained in the material which was tendered before me and marked exhibit A. That included, amongst other things, a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, psychiatrist, to which I will refer later in this judgment.

10.The defence case was contained in two reports of Dr Olav Nielssen, which were marked exhibit 1. 

11.The entirety of the material for both the Crown and the accused was tendered by consent, and indeed, I should record the fact such material was provided to me in advance of today, with the consent of both parties, in order that I could read it prior to dealing with the matter this morning.

12.In that regard I commend both the Crown, and counsel for the accused, for the efficient and helpful way in which the matter has been approached.

13.It was conceded by Mr Smith of counsel, who appears for the accused, that the material relied upon by the Crown and tendered as exhibit A was sufficient to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused was responsible for the murder of the deceased. Having read the material, that is a concession which is properly made, but equally, it is appropriate that I summarise at least parts of that evidence.

The Evidence
14.The evidence can be divided into the following categories. 

(1)The evidence of the events of the evening of 11 November 2010 and the early morning of 12 November 2010.

(2)The evidence of the latter part of the morning of 12 November 2010, going to the murder.

(3)The medical evidence pertaining to an admission into hospital of the accused in June of 2007.

(4)The Crown's medical evidence as to the mental state of the accused.

(5)The medical evidence relied on by the accused as to his mental state.

The Events of 11/12 November
15.I turn then to consider briefly the evidence of the events of the evening of 11 November 2010 and the early morning of the 12th.

16. There is evidence that on the evening of 11 November 2010, the accused was present with a number of other persons at a hotel in Nelson Bay. He left with those persons at closing time and went with them to an area called Fly Point, where they continued drinking. After that, some, but not all, of the persons in the group returned to the nearby premises of one of them.

17.According to the occupant of those premises, she asked the accused to leave, and he refused. It is evident that an altercation then ensued, firstly between the accused and the occupant of the premises, and secondly between the accused and another member of the group.

18.In the course of that altercation, the accused suffered some injury to his head and face.

19.The accused ultimately left the premises and was collected by a taxi. At the time of collecting the accused, the taxi driver observed what she described as a lump on the left hand side of his head, about two inches long and one inch wide. She also told police that she observed blood around his mouth, and she said that the accused had informed her that he had been assaulted with a cricket bat at the premises to which I earlier referred.

20.At the request of the accused, he was driven by the taxi driver to the Nelson Bay Police Station.

21.In her statement to the police, the taxi driver described the accused's demeanour en route to the police station in the following terms:

""The male appeared calm at first, but when we drove past the premises, he started to ramble and became agitated. He started growling about his stepfather. He was saying that he had been kidnapped, and 'my real father is dead'. He was saying that his step-dad was an arsehole and he had photos of his real dad on him. He wanted to show me these photos. He said that he was going to get an iron bar and kill them or him. I presumed that he was talking about the people at the previous premises. I can't remember the exact words he was using, and I can't recall, when he said about killing, if he used the words 'them' or 'him'. I started to feel uncomfortable and I dropped him off at Nelson Bay Police Station at about 6am.""

22.The accused was spoken to by police at Nelson Bay Police Station, and reported to police the fact of the assault on him earlier that evening. He was observed by police to have various injuries consistent with those described by the taxi driver, and the photographs taken by police are consistent with this description. They show what might be described as a haematoma to his skull, as well as traces of blood around his mouth.

23.Senior Constable Lang, who spoke to the accused at the Nelson Bay Police Station, said, amongst other things, the following:

""The accused showed me several photos and told me that the person in the photo when he was young was his father, and he showed me another photo of a male and a Filipino female. The accused stated that the female was his mother and the male was the person that kidnapped him and lives in Nelson Bay. The accused kept on saying, 'Look at the ears on my dad. The ears on this person are different. This is not my father.' The accused at one stage asked me to call his mother in the Philippines and she would tell me about the kidnapping.""

24.The police then made arrangements for the accused to be taken to the Tomaree Community Hospital at Nelson Bay in order that his injuries could be assessed. He was taken to the hospital, and whilst in the waiting room he had a conversation with a hospital assistant, who told the police the following:

""While I was cleaning the toilets within the waiting room area, I come out of the toilets to go to my cleaning trolley, and the young man started to talk to me. He said very politely, 'Good morning.' He sounded Australian, with a normal male voice. I said, 'Good morning.' He then said, 'I've been assaulted in the early hours of the morning, and the same man that did this to me, my step-dad, had killed my real father.' The man's voice changed slightly and he sounded angry when he said, 'I'm going back to kill him, to get even'.""

25.The accused was then assessed at the hospital. He was found to have a haematoma to his forehead, and mild bruising to his nasal bridge as well as a small laceration over his lower lip. No other injuries were found, and he was prescribed analgesia.

26.The accused was then collected by taxi from the hospital and went back to the police station. The taxi driver who conveyed him provided a statement to the police in which he said the following:

""The male appeared upset and told me that he'd been hit with a cricket bat, but said that it did not knock him out. He said that he was wasting his time going back to the police station as they would not do anything about it. I asked him had he been in trouble previously and he told me that he hadn't. I told him that if he was genuine, then they, the police, would help him. The male then said to me 'This is not over, I'm going to get my Glock and I'm going to finish it off'. I said 'Don't be silly, go home and sleep on it', he then said 'You'll read about this in the paper'. By this time I had pulled up at the police station, I dropped the male off and kept on driving"".

27.Subsequently, after a short period at the police station, another taxi arrived and took the accused back to his premises in Nelson Bay. That taxi was driven by the same taxi driver who had earlier conveyed the accused to the police station. The taxi driver said the following to the police about the accused's demeanour when she collected him from the police station:

""The male, when he got in the cab, started to get quite savage and aggressive in his whole demeanour. I can't remember his exact words but he was being very derogatory about the police not doing their job. He was saying that they needed to listen to him as he needed protecting. He then started saying in an angry voice that he was going to kill someone. He again started to say that his stepfather was an arsehole and that his real father was dead. I didn't feel threatened myself, but I did feel uncomfortable. The male just kept on repeating himself and it was like he was venting his anger to someone who was going to listen"".

The taxi then dropped the accused at his premises in Nelson Bay.

The Events on the morning of 12 November
28.The accused lived at premises with the deceased, his (ie the accused's) brother, Phillip McDonald, and a friend of the deceased, Ian McColl. There is evidence that the accused's brother Phillip had departed Australia for the Philippines on Thursday 11 November 2010. Accordingly, as at the morning of 12 November 2010, there were only three people living in the premises.

29.Mr McColl gave a lengthy statement to the police in which he described the events of the morning of 12 November 2010. That statement contained the following:

""At about 7.20am I heard a muffled thumping followed by two muffled voices. I continued dozing for a couple of minutes before I heard Bruce's dogs barking and yelping. This is what the dogs normally do when they see or hear Bruce. Within seconds I believe I heard a male voice yell my name, Ian, and the words 'I'm gonna kill you'. I'm not sure which was yelled first or whether it was the same voice or different voices, all I can say is that both statements were yelled by a muffled male voice or voices, I can't say in what tone either statement was made due to the muffle"".

30.Mr McColl described then getting out of bed and standing near the front door, from which position he was able to observe the inside of the deceased's ensuite bathroom in the premises. He told the police that when he looked towards the ensuite he observed the accused hunched over to the left side of the vanity. He was able to identify the accused due to his build and his general appearance. Mr McColl estimated that he would have been between four and five metres away from the accused when he made that observation. Mr McColl then stated:

""I sat on my bed wondering what was going on because everything was now quiet, there wasn't a sound. After about ten or 15 minutes of not hearing Bruce, or anything for that matter, I heard the sliding door to the back verandah. I thought that it may have been Bruce going out to see the dogs, but the dogs weren't barking like they normally do for Bruce. I heard some shuffling on the back verandah outside my window, which was open. It was like a scuffling noise that could be made by a metal container. The only metal container out on the verandah was a mop bucket. I heard the sliding door to the verandah open and close again before hearing water running a few seconds later. The water sounded like it was being run in the ensuite. The water ran for about a minute before it was turned off. The next noise I heard was the clanking of the mop and a bucket, which I thought was unusual for that time of the morning. I thought that something may have been spilt, but I did not know who was using the bucket"".

31.Mr McColl then described leaving the premises, going out the front of the premises and calling the police. A number of police arrived a short time later.

32.One of them, Senior Constable Parker, had a short conversation with Mr McColl, following which he (Senior Constable Parker) entered the premises. He observed blood spatter on the wall of the hallway and said that he could smell a strong smell of bleach or some other cleaning detergent. He then said:

""Senior Constable Lonergan attempted to open the door in the middle of the hallway next to the bathroom door however he couldn't. Senior Constable Lonergan managed to open the door with some force where a male was in the room. The male was Asian, he had a yellow bath towel wrapped around him, I noticed he had a lump on his forehead, left side, and a cut beside it with a little bit of blood coming out of it. I said 'Who is home with you?', he said 'Just me and my brother', I said 'Where is your father?', he said 'He is at work'"".

33.Senior Constable Parker then went outside the premises and had a further conversation with Mr McColl. He then re-entered the premises, where he observed another officer, Senior Constable Martin, placing handcuffs on the accused. His attention was then directed to a body and he looked through a bathroom and could observe what he described as a torso with blue underwear on, he said that there was a lot of blood on the body and the surrounding carpet and walls. On closer observation he said the following:

""I have observed several stab wounds on the deceased's back, his head was hard up against the wall with his face turned to his left, lying on a power board. There was blood all over the wall, floor and body. I also noticed there was a bucket in the bath full of soapy water and it had clothes in it. While walking back out I have looked in the bedroom where the Asian man was in, I have seen a large bladed kitchen knife, it had a black handle and there was blood on the blade. The knife was sitting on top of a set of chest of drawers"".

The accused was then arrested by other officers.

34.On the afternoon of 12 November 2010 Dr Rohan Samarasinghe attended the deceased's premises. He observed blood, blood spots and blood smearing in various areas of the house. He described the deceased lying face down on the floor of the bedroom with blood and blood spatter around him. He said that the bathroom tub, sink and floor were shown to be apparently plain, but that a bucket with clothing was seen inside the bathtub. He also observed a bloodstained, black handled, single cutting edge knife in another room, as well as bloodstains on the floor of the hallway, two bedrooms (in addition to that of the deceased), the lounge room, the pantry, the kitchen, the kitchen sink and the door handles of the pantry and kitchen area. He also observed various other bloodstains on the body of the deceased.

35.Dr Samarasinghe recorded, in particular, that there were multiple stab wounds to the deceased involving his head, neck, chest, abdomen, as well as his upper and lower limbs, he also observed that there was multiple stab damage to the lungs, heart and ascending aorta. He also described a hemothorax and a hemopericardium, as well as defence injuries to the hands and legs of the deceased. Dr Samarasinghe reached (inter alia) the following conclusions:

""The death resulted from a series of stab injuries which had involved the head, neck, chest, abdomen and both upper and lower limbs. The major injuries were those of the chest and were associated with damage to the heart, lungs and ascending aorta. These included three penetrating injuries to the heart and a single penetrating injury to the ascending aorta from the front of the chest"".

Dr Samarasinghe went on to express the following opinions:

""Some stab injuries to the chest would be regarded as individually fatal, particularly those associated with direct damage to the heart. The nature and distribution of the injuries, taken in conjunction with the findings at the scene, would collectively suggest the deceased had major blood loss and death from hypovolaemic shock. Given there were a large number of injuries and their scattered distribution, it is impossible to accurately determine a sequence in which the injuries were inflicted. However, there was a group of multiple stab injuries at the back of the torso and neck with the same approximate direction. There were multiple defence type injuries predominantly to the left forearm, left hand and legs. 

The nature and distribution of these injuries would suggest that the deceased may have been struggling for some time. The pattern of the stab injuries was consistent with a sustained attack by a sharp cutting weapon such as the kitchen knife found at the scene. The degree of force required to cause each stab injury was variable and this depends on many factors. These include sharpness of the cutting edge, weight of the weapon, resistance of body tissue and overlying material such as clothing. The severity and extent of the damage to the bones, costal cartilage and internal chest organs would generally indicate the use of a severe force. There was no evidence of significant natural disease processes contributing to the death"".

The evidence of the accused's hospital admission in June 2007
36.Amongst the material tendered by the Crown is evidence of the accused's admission to the Maitland Hospital on 6 June 2007 following a physical altercation with the deceased. The clinical notes of his admission record, amongst other things, that the accused told hospital staff that his father had been drinking, that he was threatening and abusing him and that he, the accused, stabbed his father in self-defence. Part of the history taken from the accused on that occasion also included the following:

""Doug reports that he may have been poisoned by his father and thought his father and mate were discussing getting rid of him when holding him down last night. He believes that his father/mate and brother may be trying to kill him and he know this as there is an unfilled hole in the backyard and an old fridge they may be keeping to put his body in"".

37.In association with his admission on that occasion the accused was examined by Dr Artin Jebejian, who diagnosed early psychosis with persecutory delusions which, in the opinion of Dr Jebejian, had been present since about May of 2007.

38.The accused was discharged from the psychiatric unit at the hospital on 14 June 2007. It was recommended that he receive case management for what was described as psycho-education and relapse prevention. It is not clear on the evidence available to me what, if any, degree of treatment the accused received after that hospital admission.

The specialist medical evidence
39.Contained within the Crown's material is a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt who examined the accused at the request of the Crown on 21 October 2011. Dr Allnutt's report which is contained within ex A is dated 31 October 2011.

40.Dr Allnutt obtained a history from the accused concerning the events of the morning of 12 November 2010 which was recorded (in part) in the following terms:

""He went home and was not thinking anything. He went to his bedroom. He did nothing in his bedroom. He put his bags and phone down. He came out and saw his father. He saw his father's eyes change colour. His father was in the hallway. He thought his father's eyes changed which made him think that his father was a different person, an impostor, and his ears were smaller.

He went to the kitchen. He was feeling really scared. He was scared that this person was going to kill him. He got a knife, came back and stabbed him. He stabbed him many times because he was scared and he thought that he was not dead. He thought this person was going to kill him. 

After he stabbed him he had blood all over him so he took a shower. He was thinking he had killed an impostor and he intended to call police. He thought at the time he was trying to protect himself. He denied mopping the floor. He said when he came out of the shower police were there. 

He said he had denied the offence to Dr Neilssen initially because he forgot things and had only remembered a couple of months ago.""

41.Dr Allnutt then proceeded to review various documentation with which he was provided, all of which is before me in ex A. In relation to the issue of psychiatric illness Dr Allnutt expressed the following opinion:

""He was not manifesting active symptoms at the time that I saw him of a significant mental illness, either a mood, anxiety or psychotic disorder. However, he provided a history of a prior admission to a psychiatric hospital three years prior to the indexed offence with the institution of antipsychotic medication which he had discontinued. 

It appears that he probably remained mentally stable for a period of a year, but after being discharged began to have a relapse with the emergence of delusions of mis-identification and visual hallucinations as well as delusions of persecution, believing that his father was an impostor and there was some conspiracy to kill him.

In my view it is likely that these delusional beliefs have been present for a number of months or possibly years prior to the index incident. He would meet criteria for a diagnosis in my view of paranoid schizophrenia which is currently in remission.""

42.In relation to the accused's mental state at the time of the commission of the alleged offence Dr Allnutt expressed the following opinion:

""At the material time of the alleged offence he was experiencing active symptoms of psychosis characterised by delusions of mis-identification, persecutory beliefs and visual hallucinations. These symptoms would be consistent with a disease of the mind, namely, psychosis.""

43.Having then considered the matter further Dr Allnutt concluded in the following terms:

""On this basis I believe he would have been incapable of reasoning about the matter with a moderate degree of sense of composure and would have had available to him the defence of mental illness.""

44.The terms in which Dr Allnutt phrased that opinion were consistent with those which appear in the decision of the High Court in R v Porter to which I will refer in a moment.

45.As I have indicated, the defence case was constituted by two reports of Dr Olav Neilssen, psychiatrist, which were admitted without objection and marked ex 1. Dr Neilssen examined the accused at the request of his solicitors on two occasions and there were two reports which emanated from those examinations, one dated 25 February 2011 and the second dated 24 August 2011.

46.At the time of the first of those examinations Dr Neilssen obtained a history from the accused which included the following:

""Mr McDonald said that he had been charged with the murder of his father, but said that he intended to enter a plea of not guilty as he said he did not commit the offence. He said that he did not know how the police came to be called to the flat he shared with his father in Nelson Bay or why he was charged, but said that the reason he was covered in blood and his blood-soaked clothes were in the bath was that he had been a victim of an assault the night before that caused him to bleed from several wounds.""

47.Dr Neilssen went on to say, 

""Mr McDonald confirmed that his father had been stabbed to death. When asked who he thought who might have been responsible for the offence he said, 'I don't know.' When asked why he thought he was charged with his father's murder he said, 'I was there at the time.'""

48.Based upon the history and the material which was provided to him Dr Neilssen arrived at a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia and he proceeded to express what he described as a preliminary opinion which was partly in the following terms:

""Mr McDonald's pre-morbid intelligence was assessed to be in the lower half of the normal range from his vocabulary and general knowledge. He would probably be able to understand the charge and the general nature of the proceedings and would also have some capacity to follow the proceedings and understand legal advice.""

49.Having expressed the opinion that at that time the accused was probably unfit for trial, Dr Neilssen went on to say the following:

""From the information available it seems likely that Mr McDonald would have the defence of mental illness open to him. Mr McDonald had previously assaulted his father in response to the persecutory belief that his father had planned to kill him. The information from Mr McDonald's friends suggests that the persecutory beliefs regarding his father had not resolved and had only become more entrenched and distressing during the years without treatment since the brief admission to Maitland Hospital in 2007.""

50.At the time of his second examination of the accused Dr Neilssen obtained a history which was substantially different to that which he obtained at the time of his first examination. On this second occasion the accused made a number of admissions to Dr Neilssen which were generally consistent with those that he had made to Dr Allnutt about being responsible for the stabbing of the deceased. Dr Neilssen recorded in his second report, amongst other things, the following:

""Mr McDonald confirmed that he had been charged with the murder of his father. He acknowledged that he had committed the offence, but intended to enter a plea of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness.""

51.At the time of his second examination Dr Neilssen noted that the accused confirmed aspects of the history which had been provided at the time of the first examination about the events of the night before, such history being generally consistent with that which I have previously outlined.

52.In terms of the accused's mental state at the time of his second examination, Dr Neilssen said that there were no obvious signs of neurological disorder, but that the accused's emotional responses were restricted in range in a way that was consistent with the blunting effect of chronic schizophrenia rather than because he was particularly depressed.

53.Having confirmed his earlier diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia, Dr Allnutt expressed, amongst other things, the following opinion:

""The diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia is based on the presence of a bizarre delusional belief that was typical of schizophrenia at the time of the initial interview in February of this year. Mr McDonald's presentation during the two interviews was also consistent with the presence of a severe form of mental illness as he was poorly groomed, had blunted emotional expressions and displayed the impoverished and literal thinking found in chronic forms of the disorder.

I believe that Mr McDonald has the defence of mental illness available to him. He has a severe and long-standing form of mental illness, for which he had received only minimal treatment, which would be recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. His disorder gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of the belief that his father had been replaced by an impostor who planned to kill him. He was probably aware of the physical nature and quality of his actions, but he did not recognise that his actions were morally wrong as in his deluded state he believed he was acting in self defence.""

54.Dr Neilssen then proceeded to express various views about the necessity for continuing treatment.

The relevant principles
55.Section 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act provides for the delivery of a special verdict. Clearly, the defence of mental illness has been raised by the accused in the material which has been tendered. In order to rely upon that defence, it must be established that at the time of the commission of the relevant act the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as to not know the quality and nature of the act he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong (see generally R v M'Naghton (1843) 8 ER 718).

56.The test was formulated by Dixon J in R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189 to 190 in the following terms:

""The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know, in this sense, whether his act was wrong if, through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind, he could not think rationally of the reasons which, to ordinary people make, that act right or wrong? 

If, through the disordered condition of the mind, he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by wrong? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.""

57.Irrespective of whether it is the Crown, the accused or the trial judge who raises the defence of mental illness, the onus of proof is on the accused to establish the defence on the balance of probabilities (see Mizzi v The Queen (1960) 105 CLR 659; R v Ayoub [1984] 2 NSWLR 511).

58.As the tribunal of fact I must firstly be satisfied that the offence which has been charged, namely, the offence of murder, is made out. In doing so, as the tribunal of fact I must ignore the question of insanity. I must rely upon the presumption of sanity and I need not consider the defence which has been raised until such time as I am satisfied that the offence of murder is proved beyond reasonable doubt (see R v Stiles (1990) 50 A Crim R 13 at 22).

59.In the present case the two specialist medical witnesses, Dr Allnutt for the Crown and Dr Neilssen for the accused, agree as to the conclusions and the opinions that they have expressed. Neither the Crown nor counsel for the accused have submitted to me that those opinions should not be accepted as properly formed and honest. Further, there is no indication whatsoever in the evidence before me which would suggest that either Dr Allnutt or Dr Nielssen have relied upon material for the purposes of forming their opinions which is in some way unsatisfactory, nor is there any suggestion that their respective conclusions reached and opinions expressed are contradicted by any other evidence. Indeed, the other evidence which is available concerning the accused's behaviour prior to the murder of the deceased is completely consistent with the views which have been expressed by each of the specialist medical practitioners.

60.Similarly, there is no indication that either Dr Allnutt or Dr Nielssen have taken steps to form their opinions which were not soundly taken, nor is there anything within their reports which reflects adversely on the validity and reliability of the opinions that they have expressed.

61.It is, of course, open to a tribunal of fact to reject the unanimous medical evidence where there is other evidence which casts doubts upon the opinions which have been expressed (see for example, R v Michaux (1984) 13 A Crim R 173; Taylor v R (1978) 22 ALR 599, especially at 608).

62.However, as I have said, there is nothing whatsoever in the evidence which would cause me to reject the opinions which have been expressed by Drs Allnutt and Nielssen as to the accused's mental state, and to the availability, to the accused of a defence of mental illness.

Resolution
63.In order to be satisfied of the commission of the offence of murder standard, I must firstly be satisfied that the deceased died. That is evident plainly from the evidence of Dr Samarasinghe, to which I have previously referred.

64.I must also be satisfied that it was the deliberate act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased. The accused has made admissions to both Dr Allnutt and Dr Nielssen as to the circumstances in which the deceased was killed. Mr Smith, who appears for the accused, invited me to rely on those admissions, and I do so. Even without those admissions, the circumstantial evidence surrounding the death of the deceased, including the ferocity of the attack upon the deceased, and the fact that it was only the accused and Mr McColl who (apart from the deceased), lived at the premises at the time form part of the evidence which is capable of satisfying me beyond reasonable doubt that it was the deliberate act of the accused which caused the decesased's death.

65.In terms of the element of causation, I also take into account the evidence of Dr Samarasinghe to which I have previously referred.

66.Finally, I must be satisfied that the act causing the death of the deceased was done with an intention to kill or with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.

67.Again, the accused's admissions to the medical practitioners support the conclusion that he intended to kill the deceased. Quite apart from those admissions, there is the evidence of statements made by the accused to persons in the hours leading up to the murder, which, on the material before me, evidence an intention to kill the deceased on the part of the accused. I also take into account a matter to which I have already referred, namely, the evidence of what was clearly a ferocious attack made upon the deceased as set out in the evidence of Dr Samarasinghe.

68.Accordingly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of the offence of murder are made out.

69.I am therefore required, because of the way in which the matter has proceeded, to turn to the defence of mental illness which has been raised by the accused.

70.I have recounted at some length the relevant parts of the opinions of Dr Allnutt and Dr Nielssen. As I have already indicated, there is unanimity between their ultimate opinions. 

71.For the reasons to which I have already referred, I have no reason to reject those opinions. Indeed, both the Crown and Mr Smith invited me to accept them and to rely upon them.

72.To the extent that there was any doubt about the matter, the opinions find support in the behaviour of the accused in the hours leading up to the murder of the deceased. In short, the behaviour of the accused, as exhibited at the time to the various witnesses to whose evidence I have referred, provides ample support, if any such support were needed, for the expert medical opinions which have been expressed regarding his mental state at the time.

73.Accordingly, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defence of mental illness has been made out. The defence as articulated by Mr Smith was, as he put it, based on the ""second limb"", that the accused did not know that what he was doing was wrong. I am satisfied on the medical evidence, on the balance of probabilities, that that was the case.

Conclusion
74.For these reasons, on the charge of the murder of the deceased, I find the accused not guilty on the grounds of mental illness.

75.Pursuant to the provisions of s 39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I order that the accused is to be returned to his present place of custody and that he be detained there, or at such other place as is deemed appropriate according to law, until such time as he is released by due process of law.

76.I further order, pursuant to subs 39(3) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, that the registrar of the Court notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Tribunal of the terms of the order that I have made pursuant to s 39(1).

		16 August 2012",2012-04-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759025,Director of Family and Community Services v Jack [2012] NSWChC 7,"Judgment

1Jack Ethan Walker was born on 3 July, 2009, and is the son of Simon Walker (occasionally referred to in some documents as Simon Harper) and Amanda Smythe. The parents lived together for about eighteen months, separating when Jack was somewhere between four and six months old. From that time until Jack was taken into care on 19 March, 2011, he spent about three months with his father and the balance of the time with his mother. Jack was living with his mother when taken into care. The application, which was filed in this court on 23 March, 2011, was based on grounds that Jack was, or was likely to be, physically or sexually abused or ill-treated, that his basic physical, psychological or educational needs were not being, or were not likely to be, met and that he was suffering or was likely to suffer serious developmental impairment or serious psychological harm as a consequence of the domestic environment in which he was living.

2A Family Law Act order was in existence at the time that Jack was taken into care, the essence of that order being that Jack was to live with his mother and that his father was to have contact.

3At the time that Jack was taken into care, he was living with his mother and his half-sister, Kylie Cooper. Kylie, who was six at the time, is Ms Smythe's daughter by another father. An identical care application was made in relation to Kylie and she also was taken into care (her case is finalised). The decision by FaCS to remove the children was made because it was considered that they were at immediate risk of significant harm based on the following factors: 


The children had been exposed to a physical altercation between their mother and Samantha (Sammy) Walker, Jack's father's sister;


Their mother was under the influence of drugs;


There was a history of drug use by the mother and the two fathers; 


The home was unhygienic and unsafe;


There was a history of physical and verbal altercations between the mother and the two fathers, those altercations occurring in the presence of the children, and


The mother and the fathers had not responded adequately to attempts that FaCS had made to redress the problems.

4FaCS' contention that Jack was a child in need of care was not opposed and a finding was accordingly made. It appears that the circumstances that have prevailed in relation to the litigation since that finding was made are quite complex. At one stage, Sammy Walker was given leave to appear as she indicated that she wished to have Jack live with her. At the commencement of the hearing, however, she did not appear and her solicitor was given leave to withdraw. The view of the parties who remain in the proceedings are as follows:


FaCS ask that parental responsibility be given to the Minister until Jack is eighteen;


The father asks that Jack be restored to his father over a period of not more than two years, that FaCS prepare a permanency plan to include the services to be provided to the father, undertakings to be made by the father and a timetable for restoration and that, until restoration is effected, parental responsibility for Jack is to be shared by the Minister and the father;


The mother supports FaCS' position, and 


The child's solicitor also supports FaCS' position.

Simon Walker, the father

5Simon Walker was, apart from FaCS officers, the only person to provide evidence. His evidence-in-chief was as follows. After he had separated from Jack's mother, Jack lived with Ms Smythe. The boy then lived with Mr Walker for about three months leading up until October, 2010. During that period Ms Smythe had obtained a recovery order from the Federal Magistrates' Court and police removed the child from Mr Walker. Mr Walker took proceedings in the Federal Magistrate's Court after the removal, the case was settled in December 2010, and Mr Walker was then able to have Jack with him on two nights a fortnight. 

6Mr Walker indicated that he had had a criminal history which included assaults, aggravated robbery and traffic offences although the only offences which he had committed in the last three years were traffic offences. He acknowledged that he had commenced using drugs unlawfully when he was thirteen but was currently free from drugs and was taking buprenorphine as part of his opoid replacement therapy. He was never a heavy drinker. 

7Mr Walker indicated that he had a daughter, Emily, to Deborah Phillips. Emily is eleven. Mother and daughter live in Queensland, Mr Walker has a good relationship with the mother, rings her every week and sees Emily during school holidays. 

8Mr Walker was concerned that Jack see his half-sister Kylie regularly as he had lived with her until his removal into care. He also pointed out that his sister, Sammy Walker, had assisted him with the care of Jack in the past, has two children of her own and was a good female role model for Jack. Mr Walker also indicated that his father lived in Queanbeyan and would provide support. 

9Mr Walker, who is currently serving a term of imprisonment for unlicensed driving matters, said that he was due to be released on 6 June, 2012, that he was undergoing the Smart Programme and the Relapse Prevention Programme while in custody, would be seeking employment and was prepared to comply with any requirements relating to supervision, drug-testing and parenting courses in an attempt to have Jack returned to him. 

10Mr Walker was cross-examined quite extensively. The following matters emerged from that cross-examination. Mr Walker began his current term of imprisonment in September 2011. He acknowledged that he had used heroin in the past. He confirmed that he had served a number of prison terms, receiving a sentence of six months for an offence of violence in 1999, three and a half years for aggravated robbery in 2002, twelve months with a four months non-parole period in 2005 and twelve months with a one month non-parole period for an assault and breach of apprehended violence order on Ms Smythe in 2009. Mr Walker said that he would, if Jack was with him, allow Ms Smythe to have contact unless that was vetoed by FaCS. Mr Walker indicated that he had undertaken a detoxification programme. 

11Mr Walker produced a Triple P certificate which had been awarded to him in June 2011, in recognition of his having completed a positive parenting programme (Indigenous triple P). The course involved, in particular, issues relating to health and bonding for children up to two years old. 

FaCS evidence relating to Mr Walker

12The bulk of evidence from FaCS related to the relationship between Jack and his mother and to his mother's shortcomings. Some of the evidence relating to Mr Walker is as follows. Mr Walker has exposed Jack to domestic violence as he had conflict with the mother and this domestic violence has included both verbal and significant physical violence (ex. 1 p.19). Mr Walker did not protect Jack from Ms Smythe in that he failed to remove the child from her (ex. 1 p. 19). Mr Walker has a history of drug use which has caused risk to Jack (ex. 1 p. 19). A care plan prepared in October, 2011, stated that the relationship between Jack and his father had been positive although Mr Walker had limited insights as to how to put limitations in place to adequately parent Jack (ex. 9 p.9). The plan stated, as an objective, the maintenance of contact between Jack and Mr Walker so that they could have a meaningful and healthy relationship (ex. 9 p. 13).

13Ms Jasna Putica, a child protection worker with FaCS, gave evidence. She is the personnel currently tending to the case but she succeeded another person in this regard. She accepted that, on occasions, when matters adverse to Ms Smythe's care of Jack resulted in FaCS' intervention, FaCS had placed Jack with Mr Walker on a temporary basis. She was not aware of any material which suggested that Mr Walker was a worse than average parent although she had concerns about his past drug history and the fact that he was prepared to leave the child with Ms Smythe. Ms Putica said, in cross-examination, that a person in Mr Walker's position would need to do or demonstrate a number of things to establish that he was a fit person to care for a child:


obtain appropriate accommodation;


obtain the support of relevant services;


co-operate with FaCS;


demonstrate appropriate parenting ability over a long period;


be free from drugs, reside in an appropriate social environment, and 


be the subject of an appropriate psychological survey. 

Ms Putica adamantly expressed her opinion that parental responsibility should go to the Minister because it was essential that the child had stability. She did concede, however, that if a final order was made giving parental responsibility to the Minister, Jack would be moved from his current carer to a long-term Aboriginal carer.

Submissions

14The submission made on behalf of FaCS' contention that parental responsibility should be with the Minister highlighted the following matters:


the child is two;


the father is in gaol until June; 


the father has a long criminal history, he has a history of violence and long-term drug abuse involving cannabis and heroin (he was in detoxification when Jack was taken into care);


he has no history of stable accommodation; 


he supported his sister's position that she should care for the child (implying that he was unfit to do so), and


he failed to take adequate steps to protect Jack from Ms Smythe's neglect and abuse and he would still be prepared to leave the child with her.

15The submission made on behalf of the father that an order should be made that would enable the father to have Jack returned to him in the short to medium future emphasised the fact that Ms Putica had stated that if a final order was made giving parental responsibility to the Minister, Jack would be moved to a long-term Aboriginal carer. There was, therefore, going to be a change to Jack's environment one way or another and a need to maintain stability could not be a feature of the case. The only feature of the case was the father's ability and adequacy to care for Jack. Ms Heinz highlighted the following matters:


the father knows that he had drug issues and the fact that he went into a detoxification programme demonstrates an insight into the fact that he knows what he has to do to address that problem;


the father is in prison for traffic offences and has not committed an act of violence since Jack was born, and 


the father will address matters that relate to the appropriate care of a child and, to the extent that he may not have done so in the past, he had not been told what he had to do to have the child returned to him. 


A reference was made to Re Leonard [2009] CLN 2 in which Mitchell SCM, said:

""A court is unlikely to be satisfied merely because a party is about to begin or is contemplating commencing a process from which a realistic possibility of restoration might or might not emerge. It is for that reason that the court usually looks for 'runs on the board' and some success, already achieved, in addressing parenting defects"". 


Ms Heinz said that the father had ""runs on the board"" - he had made an application for accommodation on his release from prison, he has been drug free for twelve months, he is no longer in a tempestuous relationship and he had the child at different times prior to the filing of the present application and there were no adverse reports received by FaCS during those times. 

16The submission made on behalf of the mother that parental responsibility should be with the Minister was wholly in writing and highlighted the following matters: 


the father is in prison, will not be released for some months and has a long history of crimes of violence, the most recent being an assault upon Jack's mother; 


the father was vague when first asked about his criminal history, 


the father has a lengthy history of drug use and has not completed a drug rehabilitation programme, there is some evidence in the FaCS papers that the father provided drugs to the mother, the father knew that the mother used drugs and could not properly care for Jack but he returned the child regularly after periods of contact, he consented to a Family Law Act order which placed the child with the mother even though he was fully aware of the mother's difficulties in caring for Jack, 


the father has no guarantee of reasonable accommodation following his release from prison and there is no evidence from family members to support his contention that they will assist him with the child. 

Mr Couchman referred to FaCS v Grant & ors (2009) CLN 10 (a decision of Marien J PCC, in the Parramatta Children's Court on 14 August, 2009) which discussed the principles to be applied in such a case and he finalised his submission by saying ""the father's application .......... is entirely fanciful and based on expressed intentions and hopes rather than on a realistic possibility"" and (referring to the reference in Re Leonard to ""runs on the board"") ""far from having 'runs on the board', it could be said that the father has yet to even strap on his pads and pick up the bat"".

17The submission made on behalf of the child that parental responsibility should be with the Minister highlighted the following matters:


although there is a possibility of restoration, it could not be suggested that it is as high as realistic;


the father's accommodation prospects are unresolved; 


there has been long-term drug use which has not been finally addressed, and 


the father stresses that he has family support but there is no evidence from those family members. 

Mr Fitzgerald completed his submission by stating that ""there are too many question marks"" to justify the order sought by the father.

Legal Principles

18The most relevant statutory provisions relating to the issues concerning a final order are to be found in s 79 and s 9 of the Children and Young Persons Care and Protection) Act 1998 (the Care Act).

19Relevant parts of section 79 of the Care Act state:

(1)If the Children's Court finds that a child or young person is in need of care and protection, it may: 

(a)make an order allocating the parental responsibility for the child or young person, or specific aspects of parental responsibility: 

(i)to one parent to the exclusion of the other parent, or 

(ii)to one or both parents and to the Minister or another person jointly, or 

(iii)to another suitable person, or 

(b)make an order placing the child or young person under the parental responsibility of the Minister. 

(2)The specific aspects of parental responsibility that may be allocated by an order of the Children's Court include, but are not limited to, the following: 

(a)the residence of the child or young person, 

(b)contact, 

(c)the education and training of the child or young person, 

(d)the religious upbringing of the child or young person, 

(e)the medical treatment of the child or young person. 

(3)The Children's Court must not make an order allocating parental responsibility unless it has given particular consideration to the principle in section 9 (d) and is satisfied that any other order would be insufficient to meet the needs of the child or young person. 

20Relevant parts of section 9 of the Care Act state:

The principles to be applied in the administration of this Act are as follows: 

(a)In all actions and decisions made under this Act (whether by legal or administrative process) concerning a particular child or young person, the safety, welfare and well-being of the child or young person must be the paramount consideration. In particular, the safety, welfare and well-being of a child or young person who has been removed from his or her parents are paramount over the rights of the parents. 

(b)Wherever a child or young person is able to form his or her own views on a matter concerning his or her safety, welfare and well-being, he or she must be given an opportunity to express those views freely and those views are to be given due weight in accordance with the developmental capacity of the child or young person and the circumstances. 

(c)In all actions and decisions made under this Act (whether by legal or administrative process) that significantly affect a child or young person, account must be taken of the culture, disability, language, religion and sexuality of the child or young person and, if relevant, those with parental responsibility for the child or young person. 

(d)In deciding what action it is necessary to take (whether by legal or administrative process) in order to protect a child or young person from harm, the course to be followed must be the least intrusive intervention in the life of the child or young person and his or her family that is consistent with the paramount concern to protect the child or young person from harm and promote the child's or young person's development. 

(e)If a child or young person is temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or cannot be allowed to remain in that environment in his or her own best interests, the child or young person is entitled to special protection and assistance from the State, and his or her name, identity, language, cultural and religious ties should, as far as possible, be preserved. 

21There is nothing in the Act which specifically indicates that a child should remain with a parent unless the court is positively satisfied that such a placement would be contrary to the child's best interests. The statutory provisions outlined above, however, suggest to me that an order giving responsibility of a child to the Minister should only be made as an order of last resort. The majority of children are raised by their parents, the relationship between parent and child is one of the closest, if not the closest, of all relationships and the mere fact of the relationship will invariably receive substantial weight in any given case. This view receives support from decisions of the High Court and courts in the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. In L v Director of Family Services (1997) 22 FAM LR 275, Higgins J said, in referring to the removal of children from the care of parents: 

""It cannot be emphasised too strongly, in my view, that the best interests of a child require the ............... powers of the State to intervene between a child and his or her family only where not to do so creates an unacceptable risk of real harm, mentally or physically to that child. To do otherwise is simply to cause serious harm on the pre-text of doing good"". 

This approach was supported by Crispen J, in CD v Chief Executive (2000) 27 FAM LR 19. It was also the view maintained by the New South Wales Supreme Court in Ex Parte Minister for Child Welfare: Re Hancock & Anor [1968] 86 WN (Pt 2) NSW 371; (1968) 1 NSWR 26. In that case the court was dealing with an application under s 82 of the Child Welfare Act 1939, which contained provisions similar to the legislation which I am considering. The court was specifically considering the impact of making an order which would deprive parents of their child and Herron CJ, said "" ............... a court should not make such an order unless it is satisfied that no other course under s.82 would have been better suited to the occasion"". Much the same view was expressed by the High Court in Minister for the Interior v Neynes (1964) 113 CLR 411.

22Ms Heinz referred in her submission to the Children's Court Practice Note 4. That practice note endorses the views expressed by the judges of the superior courts. The preamble to the practice note states:

""Community Services is undertaking a twelve month pilot project ........ to increase the use of short term care orders with the aim of keeping children in the care of their families or restoring children to .......... their families in an expeditious manner and avoiding long term care orders wherever possible"". 

23As previously indicated, the representatives of the parents referred in submissions to FaCS v Grant & ors and Re Leonard. I have already quoted a passage from Re Leonard. That passage was considered and its thrust was supported by the President of the Children's Court in FaCS v Grant & Ors, and by Johnstone DCJ, in Re Saunders and Morgan & Anor v FaCS (2008) CLN 10.

24It is clearly the case that courts make orders depriving parents of responsibility for their children only as a matter of last resort. 

Conclusion

25As previously indicated, Ms Putica adamantly expressed her opinion that parental responsibility should go to the Minister because it was essential that the child had stability. Also as previously indicated, Ms Heinz submitted on the father's behalf that Ms Putica had stated that if a final order was made giving parental responsibility to the Minister, Jack would be moved to a long term Aboriginal carer, there was, therefore, going to be a change to Jack's environment one way or another and a need to maintain stability could not be a feature of the case, the only feature of the case was the father's ability and adequacy to care for Jack. There is no doubt that Jack is going to moved - if the application of FaCS is successful, he will be moved virtually immediately to a long term carer; if the father's application is successful he may or not be moved from his current carer (there was no evidence on that point) but he would be moved into the care of his father when the father was able to properly care for him. I am inclined to think, under those circumstances, that as Jack's stability is going to be affected in any event, that issue is not as important as it might otherwise be. I do accept, however, that the child's interests would not be well served if he was to remain where he was for a further lengthy period only then to find that his father was not a suitable carer and that he was to be placed elsewhere. The child must, one assumes, be bonding with his current carers but that situation is going to end and, within reasonable limits, the sooner it ends the better for the child.

26There is no evidence whatsoever that Mr Walker has treated his son badly. Mr Walker has, during the short time that his son was in his physical custody, provided the boy with adequate food, shelter and clothing and has not hurt him or neglected him. His greatest failing as a parent has been to leave Jack with a mother who did neglect the child and who Mr Walker knew was neglecting the child. When Family Law Act proceedings were commenced by the mother Mr Walker consented to an order placing the child with Ms Smythe.

27The proposal put forward by Mr Walker is obviously based upon an acceptance by him that he cannot adequately care for Jack at present and will almost certainly not be able to do so immediately upon his release from prison. The future cannot be predicted with certainty but it is reasonable to look at the past in an attempt to make a prediction as to the future. Mr Walker has spent considerable periods in prison and has had a significant drug problem for many years. He asserts that he has now conquered his drug problem but there is little of an objective nature to support that contention. He was undergoing a detoxification programme when Jack was taken into care in March 2011 and he himself went into prison in September 2011. There is no evidence that he used drugs in the intervening period but it is difficult to accept, in the absence of corroborative evidence, that he overcame, in that short period, the deep-seated habit of many years. Mr Walker asserts that he will have family support as a parent but there is no evidence to corroborate that assertion. 

28Mr Walker cannot care for Jack at present and, in my opinion, there is no realistic possibility that he will be able to do so in the foreseeable future. 

29An order will be made allocating parental responsibility to the Minister until Jack attains his eighteenth birthday.

2759032,R v Perish; Perish & Lawton [2012] NSWSC 355,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Anthony John Perish and Matthew Robert Lawton have been found guilty by a jury of the murder of Terrence Falconer on or about 16 November 2001. They were also found guilty by the jury of conspiring with Andrew Michael Perish between 1 January 2001 and 17 November 2001 to murder Mr Falconer. 

2Andrew Michael Perish was found guilty by the jury of conspiring with Anthony John Perish and Matthew Robert Lawton between 1 January 2001 and 17 November 2001 to murder Mr Falconer. 

3The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. The maximum penalty for the crime of conspiracy to murder is imprisonment for 25 years. 

4The offences were committed in 2001. I am required to sentence the offenders in accordance with the sentencing practice as at the date of the commission of the offences and not as presently prevails: R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368. Part 4 Division 1A - standard non-parole periods of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which came into force on 1 February 2003 does not apply to the present sentences. Sections 3A and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, however, do apply. 

5It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing each offender. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and the findings of fact I make against an offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202. 

6At trial and the proceedings on sentence, Mr Leask appeared for the Crown, Ms Davenport SC appeared for Anthony Perish, Mr Hanley SC appeared for Matthew Lawton and Mr Terracini SC appeared for Andrew Perish. 

7The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the offenders had agreed to kill Terrence Falconer. 

8The genesis of the conspiracy was the unsolved murders on 14 June 1993 of Anthony and Frances Perish, the grandparents of the offenders Anthony Perish and Andrew Perish. The police investigation under the name of Strike Force Seabrook had been unable to identify who had murdered them. 

9Anthony Perish and Andrew Perish became motivated to kill Mr Falconer as they believed he had been involved in the murders. 

10Another motive for Andrew Perish to kill Mr Falconer was that he was shown by Elizabeth Falconer (the deceased's wife) at a Penrith Hotel around March/April 2001, a document which identified Mr Falconer as being prepared to assist police as an informer in respect of the activities of the Rebels motorcycle club in Dubbo. Andrew Perish had been a member of the Rebels motorcycle club. 

11In 1998, [B], ... received a phone call during which he was told that Terrence Falconer killed the Perish grandparents. The following day, [B] and his wife met Anthony Perish and discussed with him what they had been told. 

12Around March 2001, Anthony Perish met [B] at a Double Bay restaurant and asked whether he could obtain from his brother-in-law, a serving NSW police officer, some police uniforms. [B] did not ask the offender why he wanted them nor did the offender tell him. [B] told the offender about a month later his brother-in-law would not do it, but [B] had not in fact asked him. 

13On 9 July 2001, Andrew Perish met Detective Inspector Ruse, a member of Strike Force Seabrook and told him that ""Terry Falconer or Faulkner"" had admitted to the murders of Anthony and Frances Perish, to two employees of a motor vehicle wrecker's business in Sydney. Andrew Perish said that it was the owner of the business, who gave him the information, but the owner was in gaol and would not speak to police. The police had received information from other sources which suggested that Terrence Falconer was involved in the murders. Detective Inspector Ruse formally interviewed the deceased who denied the allegations. 


14The Crown case against Andrew Perish was based essentially on the evidence of [A]. He was also an important witness in the Crown cases against Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton. The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [A] gave honest and reliable evidence. [A] lived on a property at ... . 

15In early October 2001, Denise Lawton arrived at the ... property telling [A] that she had a message from 'Rooster', a name by which he knew Anthony Perish. She handed him $1,000 in cash and told him to buy some decent clothes to go to dinner in. She said, ""Andrew will come and see you in a couple of days."" Andrew Perish was ""Andrew"". 

16On 11 October 2001, Andrew Perish went to the ... property before lunch, saying to [A] that he would be back at 7pm that night, and they would go and have dinner with ""our mate"". ""Our mate"" was Anthony Perish. 

17Andrew Perish drove [A] that night to Newtown where they had dinner with Anthony Perish at a local restaurant. During the dinner, Anthony Perish said to [A], whose nickname was 'Nosey': ""So Nosey, what can you do for the company?"" To which he asked, ""What would the company have me do for them?"" Anthony Perish asked him if he had a boat to which he replied, ""It's fucked at the moment"". 

18[A] said that he had a 4.9 metre Markham Whaler with a twin Evinrude horsepower engine on it, which was in mechanical disrepair. There was further discussion about the boat during which Anthony Perish asked [A]: ""If I give you a couple of grand tomorrow, you put it in and get it fixed"". Andrew Perish was present during the whole conversation. Anthony Perish asked Andrew if he could give [A] the couple of grand on the way home. 

19During the dinner, Anthony Perish said to [A]:

""I want you to put the boat in and come up the Karuah River to Bulahdelah. There's a wharf up there, come up to the wharf and I will be waiting for you just like a fisherman with a couple of esky's because the cunt might be in a few pieces."" 

Anthony Perish was referring to Terrence Falconer. The offenders planned to kill him, dismember his body and to dispose of the body parts by using [A] and his boat. 

20There had been discussion during the dinner at Newtown that a mobile phone would be dropped off to [A] by the person who drove the truck down to Adelaide when [A] had moved to that city. This was the offender Matthew Lawton. 

21Whilst Andrew Perish was driving [A] back to the ... property, they stopped at his home in Eagle Vale. Andrew Perish picked up $2,000 from inside his house and gave it to [A]. 

22The next morning, [A] took the boat to Marine Scene at Campbelltown and, after further phone calls, obtained a quotation as to the cost of the boat repairs. He spoke to Andrew Perish informing him that during the initial work on the boat, another problem had been found. The power head on the left- hand motor needed replacing at a cost of $4,000 alone. [A] asked Andrew Perish what he wanted to do and was told to ""get it done"".

23Andrew Perish subsequently gave [A] $1,500 in cash at the ... property and $3,000 in cash at Daniel Perish's place at Rossmore. The money was to be applied to the cost of repairing the boat. 

24Matthew Lawton delivered a 'Motorola Talkabout' mobile phone (the McDowell phone) to [A] at the ... property. He told [A] to keep the phone on and charged and not to contact anyone else other than Anthony and Andrew Perish. The phone was in the name of John McDowell and was activated by [A] on 29 October 2001. 

25On 31 October 2001, [A] had travelled to Salamander Bay to undertake a reconnaissance of the regional waterways. He had purchased from the Newcastle Water Ways Office four maps of the surrounding waters. 


26Anthony Perish visited [A] at the ... property at least three times after the dinner. On each occasion, Matthew Lawton drove him to the property. During the second last visit, Anthony Perish handed [A] a document that [A] described as being a police document with Terry Falconer's name on it. He said that the document stated that Terry Falconer was prepared to give evidence against the Rebels motorcycle club in Dubbo as to their drug dealings. Although Anthony Perish had never been a member of the Rebels motorcycle club, his brother Andrew was a former member. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Anthony Perish believed that Mr Falconer was a police informer, which provided added justification for his plan to kill the deceased. 

27[A] and Anthony Perish discussed the Karuah River and where the boat was going to be put in. Bulahdelah was eliminated because of the four or five knot speed restriction throughout the river.

28During the last visit on 9 November 2001, one week before Mr Falconer was murdered, there was a discussion between [A] and Anthony Perish about the boat being ready. Anthony Perish said to [A]: ""Get onto it, hurry up, because this cunt goes this Friday regardless."" He also said:

""You'll come up, you'll pick up a couple of eskys, you'll go out and take them out to the continental shelf. You will empty out the contents over a big hole using a depth sounder. On the way back wash those eskys out halfway back and throw them over the side. When you get back, wash the boat out with ammonia.""

29Anthony Perish went on to say:

""If you wash it out with ammonia they can tell there's been blood in the boat but they can't tell whose it is, it fucks the DNA"" 

30The offender told [A] that he was not coming with him and that was what [A] was being paid for. [A] understood that the plan had changed as Anthony Perish no longer intended accompanying him on the voyage to dispose of Mr Falconer's body parts. 

31[A] decided not to participate in the dumping of the body parts as he had come to fear for his own safety. All incoming calls to his mobile phones were diverted after 12 November 2001, and attempts by Andrew Perish to ring him on 14 and 15 November 2001 were unsuccessful. [A] took no further part in the plan to kill Terrence Falconer.

32Anthony Perish had initially engaged [E] to investigate the murder of his grandparents but subsequently planned for Terrence Falconer to be abducted by [E] and taken to the premises where he was living at Kirkpatrick Street, Turramurra. 

33Mr Falconer had been serving a term of imprisonment for drug offences. He was nearing the end of his sentence and had been classified as a minimum security prisoner which made him eligible for work release. An electronic monitoring bracelet had been fitted to his ankle on 28 March 2001 and he had been sponsored for work at Wreck-A-Mended Smash Repairs at Ingleburn. He commenced work on 17 May 2001 and his usual hours of work were 8am to 4.30pm. Mr Falconer was required to be back at Silverwater prison by 7pm.

34About three months before the murder, Anthony Perish approached [E] with his plan to abduct Mr Falconer, whilst he was on work release. [E] was told by Anthony Perish to obtain a van, a lockbox and to look like police so that Mr Falconer could be taken from his work. Anthony Perish told him to handcuff Mr Falconer as he would put up a fight and put an anaesthetic, like chloroform over his mouth. 

35[E] recruited [H] and Craig Bottin (Bottin) to assist in the abduction. [H] met [E] in the middle of 2001, during which [E] said to him, ""Look, there's a job that has come up. There's a guy who needs to get information, a guy who has done terrible things. He's a scumbag and he needs myself and Craig to help him out with this because this is a guy who is able to take care of himself"". During a second meeting between [E] and [H], [E] told [H] that they were to dress up as police officers and to pretend to arrest Mr Falconer for questioning. [E] said that he would use chloroform to subdue Mr Falconer after he had been taken. [H]'s role was to be the driver of the vehicle and Bottin would assist [E] in the arrest. [H] and [E] reconnoitred the smash repair business in preparation for the abduction. 

36Matthew Lawton obtained steel wheel rims and painted them silver at Anthony Perish's premises at Turramurra, so that the rims on [E]'s VT Commodore would resemble the rims on a police vehicle. [E] had been staying with Anthony Perish and intended using his Commodore in the abduction. He delivered the vehicle to [H]. 

37On the afternoon of the abduction, [E], [H] and Bottin met at a grassy embankment close to Wreck-A-Mended Smash Repairs. [E] had parked a white van at the rendezvous, where they changed their clothes and the Commodore's appearance was altered to look like an unmarked police vehicle. The hubcaps were removed, the licence plate changed and an aerial was placed on the back window. 

38Around 3pm, [H] drove [E] and Bottin in the Commodore to Wreck-A-Mended Smash Repairs. [H] was wearing a blue police shirt with shoulder patches and blue pants. He remained in the vehicle. [E] and Bottin were wearing business suits to look like detectives and were armed with 'Glock pistols'.

39Mr Falconer had arrived for work at about 8am. [E] and Bottin went into the premises, presented police identification badges to employees and were taken to Mr Falconer. [E] conducted a body search on Mr Falconer, who he then handcuffed with handcuffs that Anthony Perish had given him. Mr Falconer was placed in the rear seat of the Commodore between [E] and Bottin. 

40At trial, [H] gave evidence to the effect that when they reached the grassy embankment, he heard a scuffle in the backseat. He turned around and saw [E] placing a rag with chloroform on it, upon Mr Falconer's mouth. [H] said that Mr Falconer was putting up a bit of a struggle, but [E] continued to apply the rag to his face and Mr Falconer was rendered unconscious. In the electronically recorded interview (ERISP) that [E ] entered into with police on 22 January 2009, [E] recounted that, after putting his handkerchief in the chemical that was in a ""big orange juice bottle"", he placed the handkerchief over Mr Falconer's face, but Mr Falconer was struggling and trying to hit him with his handcuffed hands. Bottin helped him to subdue the deceased, who continued to struggle, but after about another thirty seconds became dopey. During his evidence before the jury, [E] remembered that when he held the rag over Mr Falconer's mouth, that he struggled violently and it took a while to subdue him. [E] agreed that he told the Magistrate at the committal hearing, that Bottin physically came over and that he, [E], put pressure down on the deceased's hand and chest. He said that he was protecting himself from being hit in the head with handcuffs. [E] did not recall having to punch Mr Falconer, nor did he see Bottin punch the deceased to the right side of the face. 

41During the trial, [E] told the jury that he carried Mr Falconer from the Commodore to the white van with either the assistance of Bottin or [H]. The monitoring bracelet had been removed from Mr Falconer's ankle and discarded. In the van was a box that he had purchased from a hardware store for the purpose of putting Mr Falconer in it. In his ERISP, [E] said that the box was made of ""galvanised tin, or tin plate maybe, like one you buy at Bunnings but more heavy duty."" It was close to six feet in length, but there were no additional holes drilled into it. Professor Yeomans examined various metal items that police had located at 158 Brooks Road, Girvan in March 2009. He concluded that the items were consistent with the base, the side and the lid of a metal box. Professor Yeomans estimated that the box would have been 500mm wide, 500mm high, but somewhat in excess of 760mm long. The box was made of an older style of sheet metal. I am satisfied that this was the box which was in the white van. 

42The jury was told by [E] that when Mr Falconer was placed in the box, he was not on his face. Mr Falconer was neither talking nor were his eyes open. [E] drove the van to Turramurra but did not recall by what route he drove there. He remembered that when the box was opened in Anthony Perish's garage at Turramurra, Mr Falconer looked ""pretty crook"", but he thought that Mr Falconer was alive. In cross-examination by Mr Hanley, he said that Mr Falconer was not just lying there, he gasped, his torso went up, and he looked in a pretty bad way. 

43In his ERISP, [E] told police that Mr Falconer was coughing more and more and had been in the box ""for quite a period of time"". When the box was opened, Mr Falconer started to get up and [E] put his foot at Mr Falconer's torso as he thought ""he was going to try and up and at us"". [E] said that Anthony Perish grabbed Mr Falconer's head, slammed it down, pulled up his shirt and he saw a Gypsy Joker tattoo. [E] recounted that Anthony Perish closed the box, which Perish and Matthew Lawton put into the tailgate of a utility. Anthony Perish directed [E] to go with Matthew Lawton in the utility to Girvan, whilst Anthony Perish got rid of the white van. [E] described a slow journey to Girvan and the box not being opened until Anthony Perish arrived some time later. [E] said that when the box was opened at Girvan, Mr Falconer was dead. 

44During the trial, competing issues arose as to the cause and the time of the death of the deceased being whether:

(a)as a result of being assaulted, chloroformed, placed in the metal box and being driven in the white van from the grassy embankment to Turramurra, the deceased died during the journey and was not alive when the box was opened in Anthony Perish's garage at Turramurra; or 

(b)the deceased was alive at Turramurra but dead when the box was opened at 158 Brooks Road, Girvan. 

45The Crown case at trial was that irrespective of when and how the deceased died, Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton were guilty of his murder. It is unnecessary to repeat here, the directions provided to the jury. During the proceedings on sentence Ms Davenport and Mr Hanley submitted that the time and the manner of the deceased's death impacted upon the determination of the moral culpability of the offenders and the objective seriousness of their actions, whereas Mr Crown contended that it had no impact whatsoever. As I do not agree with the Crown's argument, it is necessary to consider this issue in some detail. 

46Ms Davenport and Mr Hanley submitted that the court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Falconer was alive when he arrived at Turramurra. They referred to [E] admissions to [H] and [C] and to the evidence of Professor Lyons as supporting the reasonable possibility that the death could have occurred before the arrival at Turramurra. Mr Crown invited the court to accept [E]'s account in the ERISP and directed attention to independent support for his evidence. 

47In his closing address to the jury, Mr Crown referred to 15 matters of evidence that were said to independently support [E]'s testimony in the trial. Of particular significance to the present question, is the evidence of Professor Lyons of the Gypsy Joker tattoo seen on the deceased's remains during the autopsy and the evidence of bruising to the deceased's face. 

48Dr Lee, who conducted two autopsies on the deceased's dismembered remains, found an ill-defined area of bruising extending from the lateral right cheek past the outer aspect of the eye, involving the right lateral forehead and extending into the hairline. There was also an ill-defined area of apparent bruising situated over the right side of the jaw midway between the point and the angle. Dr Lee was unable to determine the cause of death. 

49The onus is on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Falconer was alive, when he arrived at Turramurra. 

50In his evidence at trial, [H] said that Mr Falconer was unconscious when he was carried from the car to the box in the van. Whilst unconscious, he was placed lying on his back in the box. Mr Falconer appeared to be breathing, because he was snoring and his chest was rising up and down. [H] told the jury that his main concern was that once the box lid was closed, Mr Falconer might not be able to breathe. There was, he said, no obvious part of the box where air could get in and he could not see any air holes drilled in it. When he expressed his concern to [E], [E] told him that the deceased was not going to be in the box for long, it was going to be a short journey and the deceased would be returned back to Wreck-A-Mended Smash Repairs before the day was out. 

51Detective Sergeant Browne gave evidence that the police had timed how long it took to drive from the smash repairs at Ingleburn to Kirkpatrick Street, Turramurra, not exceeding the speed limit and replicating the route that existed on 16 November 2001, before the M5 freeway extension was built. The journey took police between two hours and fifteen minutes and two hours and forty minutes. 

52Professor Lyons gave evidence that chloroform was no longer used as a modern anaesthetic because it was dangerous to the heart and liver. He explained that someone who is unconscious and lying on his back, has an unprotected airway, so that there is a tendency for the structures of the mouth to fall backwards. One clinical sign of a restriction of the airway was snoring. In a limited amount of oxygen, the process of respiration would raise the level of carbon dioxide. Professor Lyons said that oxygen would be consumed, carbon dioxide produced, the level of which could adversely affect the brain and the heart to the point that ultimately breathing could stop. Professor Lyons considered it was a possibility where someone was in a very restricted area, snoring on his back having been subjected to some form of anaesthesia that death could occur within two hours. 

53[H] gave evidence that a couple of days after the abduction, he and [E] had lunch at a restaurant in Double Bay. [E] said words to the effect of, ""Look, I don't know if you have heard or read anything, but Falconer had to go. He was going to rat us out."" [H] said that [E] brought up the topic again about an hour and a half later. [E] said Falconer was not giving him the answers he wanted, that Falconer was being ""a smart arse"" and he chopped Falconer's head off. [H] described [E] as being very happy with how things had gone and with how professional they had been on the job. 

54[C], who had been [E] business partner, told the jury that [E] asked him if he had seen an article about a person being abducted from a panel beater's shop by police. During the conversation, [E] said that he, [H] and ""Skits"" (Bottin) had done it, that [H] was wearing the police uniform and the plates had been stolen from a police car. [E] went on to say:

""We went into the panel beater's shop and..., we told them we were cops, we showed them a badge. We grabbed Falconer and put him into the car. There was a struggle in the back seat. I hit him too hard and he died. I really fucked up, I was only supposed to take him to somebody else to be tortured. I fucked up."" 

55It is plain that [E] 's account to [H] that he had chopped Mr Falconer's head off was an exaggeration. His disclosure to [C] that there had been a scuffle in the backseat is consistent however, with [H]'s recollection of a struggle after they arrived at the grassy embankment. Although [H] did not see [E] strike the deceased, the struggle was not inconsequential. [H] was instructed by [E] to have both the interior and exterior of the Commodore cleaned. In cross-examination by Mr Hanley, [H] agreed that there was a direction from [E] specifically aimed at cleaning up some scuff marks that were on the back of the front seats which he understood had been caused in the struggle. I consider it to be a reasonable possibility that [E] did hit the deceased hard, whilst he was attempting to subdue him and trying to avoid being struck by Mr Falconer's handcuffed hands. Such a finding raises the reasonable possibility that the deceased's facial bruising may have occurred otherwise than by Anthony Perish grabbing his head and slamming it down. [E] participated in the dismemberment of the deceased's body at Girvan and it is a reasonable possibility that he saw the Gypsy Joker tattoo after Mr Falconer's death. 

56When the evidence of the struggle, the use of a chloroform like substance, Mr Falconer's snoring, the size of the box, the lack of ventilation and the length of the journey to Turramurra is considered in combination, there is a reasonable possibility, in my view, that Mr Falconer died before he arrived at Turramurra. 

57In reaching this conclusion, I have not disregarded [B]'s evidence of a conversation that he had with Anthony Perish at North Sydney in June 2006. Anthony Perish told [B] that he and [E] killed Mr Falconer at ""Redman's [E] mum's place up the coast"". The reliability of this account is diminished as it was common ground in the trial that the property at Girvan was never owned by [E]'s mother and that she did not have an association with it. Furthermore, there was no evidence whatsoever of any proprietary interest that [E] or any member of his family had in that property. 

58I do not propose to comment on the answers given by [E] in his ERISP, much of which was supported by the independent evidence upon which the Crown relied, other than to state that I am not satisfied that his account of events at Turramurra, was honest and reliable. 

59The Crown has not established beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was alive at Turramurra. Accordingly, Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton are to be sentenced on the basis of the deceased being dead at the time of his arrival at Kirkpatrick Street. 

60I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased's body in the box, was taken from Turramurra to Girvan in the utility driven by Matthew Lawton, who was accompanied by [E]. After disposing of the white van, Anthony Perish joined them at Girvan and they dissected the body. The body parts were placed into plastic bags that were wound with wire and duct tape and dropped into the Hastings River. I do not accept that [E] had been forced by the threat of the use of a gun to travel to Girvan and to assist in the dismemberment of the body. It is evident that [E] maintained a close relationship with Anthony Perish, which included an invitation to his wedding in 2008. They were arrested together at McMahons Point on 19 January 2009. 

61On 26 November 2001, six of the bags were found in the Hastings River, a seventh bag being located on 13 September 2002. 

62By its verdicts on the charge of conspiracy to murder, the jury determined that all three offenders entered into an agreement to kill Mr Falconer and each of them participated in that agreement. Anthony Perish was the mastermind behind the plan to abduct Mr Falconer, to kill him, to dismember his body and to dispose of his remains. He recruited [A] and [E] and instructed them on the role that each would play in the conspiracy. Andrew Perish and Matthew Lawton acted upon his directions. 

63Andrew Perish was present at the Newtown dinner and knew that the plan was to kill Mr Falconer, dissect his body and [A] was to be used to dispose of the remains. He assisted his brother in recruiting [A], paid for the repairs to his boat and authorised him to proceed with further repair work to the vessel, which Andrew Perish paid for. Andrew Perish, with his brother Anthony, were the only persons that [A] was to contact on the McDowell phone. He endeavoured unsuccessfully to ring [A] on 14 and 15 November 2001. There is no evidence that Andrew Perish played any part in the procurement of [E] or that he knew that [E] was to abduct the deceased. His role was confined to [A]. The Crown has not established beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew Perish played any part in the agreement to kill Mr Falconer after 15 November 2001. His culpability for the conspiracy to murder is less than that of Anthony Perish. 

64Matthew Lawton was not present at the Newtown dinner but delivered the McDowell phone to [A] with instructions as to its use and drove Anthony Perish to the meetings with [A] at the ... property. Whilst he was present at these meetings, the evidence does not establish that he took part in the discussions between [A] and Anthony Perish. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Matthew Lawton became aware that Anthony Perish had procured [E] to abduct Mr Falconer. He was neither engaged in the planning of the offence nor the recruiting of [A] and [E]. 

65At trial, the Crown did not seek to prove a motive for Matthew Lawton's participation in the offending. Mr Hanley submitted that in assisting the commission of the offences, Matthew Lawton was inferentially recruited by Anthony Perish. It is plain from the evidence that the offender was under the influence of and subordinate to Anthony Perish, with whom he had a long association. His culpability for the conspiracy to murder is less than that of the other two offenders. 

66An agreement to kill another person is a most serious crime. Each of the offenders took steps directed at its successful completion. 

67At a later stage in these sentencing remarks, I will detail the backgrounds of each of the offenders. I accept that Anthony Perish and Andrew Perish agreed to kill Mr Falconer for the principal reason that they believed he was involved in the murder of their grandparents and they had become frustrated with the lack of progress in the police investigation. Each of these offenders had a close relationship with their grandparents and were motivated by their desire to right the wrong that Mr Falconer was perceived to have committed. Although that might explain the agreement to kill him and the murder, it does not mitigate the objective seriousness of these offences. A civilised society cannot condone the offenders' conduct. It is well established that resort to criminal conduct as a response to a crime believed to have been committed by the victim is to be severely discouraged. In our society, crime must be investigated by police and dealt with by the courts: Barlow v R [2008] NSWCCA 96; R v Mitchell [2007] NSWCCA 296. The existence of such a motive remains relevant, however, to questions of personal deterrence and protection of the community. 

68By its verdicts on the charge of murder, the jury determined that Anthony Perish procured [E] to abduct Mr Falconer and bring him to Turramurra, that he did so with the intention to kill Mr Falconer some time thereafter and that his actions made a substantial contribution to Mr Falconer's death. The jury rejected as a reasonable possibility that it was the offender's intention to question Mr Falconer and not to kill him. 

69The jury determined that Matthew Lawton was a member of the conspiracy to murder the deceased and was a party to the joint criminal enterprise to abduct him. The jury were satisfied that Matthew Lawton had an intention to kill Mr Falconer and his actions made a substantial contribution to the death. 

70The Crown does not submit that this case falls within the worst category of murder and therefore attracts the imposition of a life sentence. There is no suggestion of future dangerousness. 

71Ms Davenport and Mr Hanley submitted that the conspiracy to murder and the murder should be considered as one offence in the cases of Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton. Ms Davenport contended that, had it not been for the fact that Andrew Perish was charged with conspiracy, the Crown would not have charged the other offenders with that offence. Mr Hanley argued that the ""temporal, factual and historical connected-ness"" between the two offences, reflected one course of criminal conduct. Both counsel suggested that if their submissions were accepted, the planning involved could be treated as a factor of aggravation in the murder. 

72It seems to me to attempt to draw a line between the two offences for the purposes of sentencing Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton, creates an artificiality and defies common sense. I accept that the actions of these offenders in reality reflect one course of criminal conduct. 

73Anthony Perish meticulously planned the murder. He recruited [A] and [E]. He contrived that Mr Falconer was to be abducted on work release by [E] posing as a police officer, then handcuffed, sedated and placed in a box to be delivered to Turramurra. He supplied to [E] a police shirt, handcuffs and the chloroform like anaesthetic. When [E] arrived at Turramurra, Anthony Perish was present and he expected that Mr Falconer would be alive. He intended to kill Mr Falconer, but not all matters went as planned, as Mr Falconer had died on the journey. 

74Anthony Perish had also planned for the deceased's body to be dissected at Girvan and disposed of by [A]. He carefully considered the various waterways and had concluded that the body parts were to be taken by [A] out to the continental shelf and emptied over the side of [A]'s boat. He instructed [A] to wash the boat with ammonia to make it difficult for DNA to be detected. When the scheme was interrupted by the desertion of [A], Anthony Perish decided that the body parts would be placed into the Hastings River. 

75Although Matthew Lawton did not plan the abduction, he obtained steel wheel rims and painted them silver so that the rims on [E]'s VT Commodore would resemble the rims on a police vehicle. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was present at Turramurra when [E] arrived as he intended to kill Mr Falconer and to participate in the dismemberment of his body. 

76It is a factor of aggravation that the murder was carefully planned. 

77Mr Hanley submitted that the dismemberment and disposal of the deceased's body were done with a view to avoiding detection and should not be given significant weight. The treatment of the deceased's body can be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of the offence: Knight v The Queen (2006) 164 A Crim R 126. Mr Crown, however, did not dispute Mr Hanley's contention that the treatment of the body did not elevate the seriousness of the offence, but said that it was relevant on sentence to demonstrate the state of mind of Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton as one of callousness. I accept the Crown's submission. 

78There is no evidence that suggests the deceased's body was dismembered for a purpose other than to hide the crime. The callousness with which the murder was planned and carried out is disclosed by the manner in which the offenders and [E] went about dissecting the body at Girvan. 

79I conclude that the objective gravity of this offence is of a high order. Both offenders callously endeavoured to ensure that the careful plan to kill Mr Falconer would be successful. It matters little that he died unexpectedly in [E]'s white van. I accept that Matthew Lawton's role was subordinate to Anthony Perish and his culpability for the murder is less than his co-offender. Nevertheless, the objective seriousness of his offending remains high. 

80Anthony Perish was born on 4 September 1969 and at the time of the murder was 32 years old. He is now 42 years old. He was arrested on 19 March 2009 and has been in custody since that time. His criminal history, prior to his arrest, reveals minor offences, the last of which was committed on 10 October 1990. 

81On 15 December 2011, he was convicted of attempting on 9 June 2010 to wilfully dissuade [A] from giving truthful evidence against him in committal proceedings and sentenced to imprisonment for two months to date from 10 August 2010. I am mindful that offences committed after the murder, may not be taken into account for the purposes of imposing a heavier sentence, but may be considered for the purpose of deciding whether the offender is deserving of leniency: R v Hutchins (1958) 75 WN (NSW) 75; R v Bowey (unrep, 22/7/91, NSWCCA). 

82The offender's record of previous convictions has not involved violence and does not disentitle him from considerations of leniency. I give to this consideration, modest weight in mitigation, owing to the gravity of the present offences. 

83Anthony Perish did not give evidence at trial, or during the proceedings on sentence. His subjective circumstances are principally drawn from the history given to Michelle Player, a clinical psychologist. He is the fourth child of seven children born to his parents. One of his sisters was killed in a car accident in 1983. He has two sisters and three brothers. The offender was raised by his parents on an egg and poultry farm at Leppington. He had a close, supportive and nurturing relationship with his mother, but a strained relationship with his father, who held high expectations of the offender as his eldest son. The offender developed a stutter in infancy and never saw a speech pathologist to address his speech impediment. He did not enjoy his schooling years, had no interest in study and was a below average student. The offender left school in mid-Year 8 just shy of his 15th birthday. He completed a four-year apprenticeship in panel beating and spray painting, graduating when he was 20 years old. About this time, he moved to Queensland where he lived until aged 35 years. After buying and selling cars for profit, he progressed to operating his own excavator and bobcat business. 

84The offender has a son, now 20 years old from a short relationship when the offender was in his early twenties. He was unaware that his ex-girlfriend had given birth to his son until about eight years later. The offender has been involved in his son's life since that time and remains in contact with him. Prior to his arrest in 2009, the offender was co-habiting with his partner, with whom he had commenced a relationship when he was about 26 years old. The relationship ended in 2010, but the offender maintains a sound relationship with his partner's son. 

85Anthony Perish was close to his paternal grandparents, Anthony and Frances Perish, when he was growing up in Leppington. They lived about a 15 minute walk away from the offender's parent's home on the other side of the family property. The offender told Ms Player that his grandparents were nurturing and affectionate towards him and that he had a particularly close relationship with his grandfather. He had lived with his grandparents for a total of six months in his mid-adolescence. 

86When his grandparents were murdered, the offender was 23 years old and living in Queensland. Ms Player reports that the offender was unable to join his family in Sydney to receive support and grieve with them. He told Ms Player that his grandparents' murders ""shattered the family's innocence"" and made him aware of ""how bad the world can be."" He said that he had felt frustration for many years about the lack of progress in the police investigation into his grandparents' murders and stated that he did not think that he had grieved properly, that it had burnt him out. 

87Ms Player expressed the opinion that the offender ""reveals a frozen grief response in relation to the death of his sister and murder of his grandparents, which he has attempted to suppress."" The psychologist opines that Anthony Perish's offending behaviour ""seems to have stemmed from his struggle to resolve the deaths of his grandparents, with whom he was particularly close, and pre-occupation with determining who was responsible for their deaths."" Ms Player reports that the offender ""appears regretful for the death of the victim and willing to participate in interventions to address his recidivism risk."" 

88Ms Player assessed Anthony Perish's risk of violence with the HCR-20 clinical risk assessment guide and found that the offender presents an overall low risk of violent recidivism. She recommended that the offender access individual psychological therapy whilst in gaol. The offender has completed various courses whilst in custody and the transcripts of his academic record were tendered. The Corrective Services case note reports disclose that he has been of good behaviour and is now the unit delegate. I take all these matters into account. 

89It is clear that Ms Player's report of the expression of remorse by the offender does not amount to acceptance of responsibility for his actions. At the commencement of the trial, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis that he agreed with [E] that Mr Falconer should be abducted and that he contemplated the possibility, at least, that in the course of the abduction, serious injury might be caused to Mr Falconer and that was an unlawful and dangerous act. Ms Player reports that the offender denies that he intended to cause harm to Mr Falconer, which is consistent with his pleas of not guilty to conspiracy to murder and to murder. Accordingly, he must be sentenced on the basis that he demonstrates no contrition or remorse for his offending. His sentence is not to be increased for that, but no allowance in mitigation can be made for remorse or contrition. As he refuses to accept responsibility for the murder, his prospects of rehabilitation remain guarded. I am unable to make a positive finding on the balance of probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. Nevertheless, in the circumstances of the present case, I conclude that the offender's motive to avenge his grandparents' murders lessens the need for personal deterrence and protection of the community: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47. The offender's lack of a prior criminal history of violence and good behaviour in custody re-enforces this conclusion.

90I accept Ms Davenport's submission that concessions made on Anthony Perish's behalf shortened the length of the trial and facilitated the course of justice. I take that into account in moderation of the offender's sentence. 

91Ms Davenport did not submit that special circumstances exist that justifies a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence. 

92Matthew Lawton did not give evidence at trial, or during the proceedings on sentence. His subjective circumstances are principally drawn from the history given to Tim Watson-Munro, a forensic psychologist. Matthew Lawton was born on 3 December 1966 and was 34 years old at the time of the offences. He is now 45 years old. He was born in Sydney and has a brother and sister, with whom he has no real contact. His parents are alive, but divorced when he was 21 years old. He had no contact with his father for about 20 years after the divorce. The offender describes a positive relationship with his mother, who is highly supportive of him. 

93The offender left school, having attained the School Certificate. Thereafter, he was employed in various unskilled jobs and worked as a truck driver for 20 years prior to his arrest. Until about five years ago, the offender was an alcoholic. He told the psychologist that his father was a heavy drinker and described a difficult childhood and adolescence. The offender has been in several de facto relationships. He has two sons aged 18 and 14 years. He has been with his current partner for 8 years, who is supportive of him. 

94Mr Watson-Munro expressed the opinion in his report dated 15 March 2012 that the offender has suffered a range of symptoms referable to an ""Anxiety Disorder"" according to DSM-IVTR criteria. Mr Watson-Munro opined that the offender's primary problems relate to his incarceration and his appreciation of the gravity of the verdicts. He has ongoing anxiety and diminished self-esteem. The offenders overall mood state had deteriorated arising from the fact that he is in protective custody. Mr Watson-Munro stated that the offender is having no treatment and is currently suffering from suicidal ideation to the point where a psychiatrist consulted him on one occasion but no medication was prescribed, which Mr Watson-Munro considered, was indicated. In addition, he suffers from Sleep Apnoea which Mr Watson-Munro reported, should be addressed as a matter of urgency. The psychologist believed that the offender would respond best to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy to teach him effective skills to deal with his anxiety, depression and diminished self-esteem. 

95It was not submitted by Mr Hanley that the offender's health is a factor tending to mitigate punishment and enlivens the principles in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587. There is no evidence to suggest that the concerns raised by Mr Watson-Munro as to the offender's health cannot be adequately managed by the prison medical staff and that imprisonment will be a greater burden for him by his reason of his mental or physical condition. 

96In a letter dated 6 November 2011, Graham Lawton, the offender's father recounts his son's assistance to an elderly neighbour, which he states is but one example of the offender's compassion towards others. Wendy Lawton, the offender's mother, refers in her letter to her son's love and support and describes, in particular, his care and attention for his brother James, who suffers from a tumour. Leone Davidson, the offender's aunt, also brings to the court's attention, the offender's compassion, love and importance in the lives of his family and close relations. Sharon Miller, in a letter dated 9 March 2012 states that the offender is a placid, loving, devoted father and a respectful considerate partner. I take all these matters into account. 

97Mathew Lawton does not have a significant criminal record, which is a mitigating factor that I take into account. He has no convictions since 1995 and the offences are relatively minor. I give to this consideration, modest weight in mitigation, owing to the gravity of the present offences. It does also lessen the need for personal deterrence and protection of the community. Matthew Lawton has neither expressed nor shown contrition for his offending and no allowance can be made for those factors in mitigation. As he has not accepted responsibility for his actions, his prospects of rehabilitation remain guarded. Notwithstanding his strong family support and lack of prior offending, I am unable to make a positive finding on the balance of probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. 

98Mr Hanley submitted that some reduction in sentence might be allowed as Matthew Lawton has been serving his sentence in protective custody. It appears that the offender has, on his own volition, been held in a protective area in 10 wing Special Management Area Placement (SMAP) since 6 February 2012, as a result of allegations that he is a police informer. The details of his incarceration as a SMAP inmate are set out in the letter dated 14 March 2012 from Corrective Services NSW. The offender's conditions of protective custody do not appear to be onerous. The main restriction, it seems, is that the offender is only permitted to mix with other inmates of the same protection status. I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the offender will serve his sentence in conditions that are more difficult or onerous than other prisoners in the general prison population. Furthermore, I am unable to predict for how long that the offender will serve his sentence as a SMAP prisoner. I do not propose to reduce the offender's sentence in the light of the current custodial arrangements. 

99Mr Hanley did not submit that special circumstances exist that justifies a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence. 

100Andrew Perish was born on 19 January 1971. He was 30 years old at the time of his offending and is now 41 years old. His criminal history as an adult prior to the commission of the present offence, discloses that other than driving offences, he had been convicted on 13 September 1994 of conspiracy to manufacture a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and placed on a 5 year good behaviour bond. There are no matters on his record either before or after the commission of the present offence that involve actual violence. He was, however, convicted in the Campbelltown Local Court on 28 June 2007 for an offence of stalking, with intention to cause fear and was placed on a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for 2 years. On 24 March 2009, he was sentenced in the District Court at Campbelltown for manufacturing a commercial quantity of drug and possession of an unauthorised pistol in 2007. There were matters on a Form 1 that were taken into account. He was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 5 years expiring on 4 April 2012 with a non-parole period of three years four months. The earliest date that the offender was eligible for release to parole was 4 August 2010. 

101On 15 December 2011, he was convicted of attempting on 9 June 2010 to wilfully dissuade [A] from giving truthful evidence against him in committal proceedings. He was sentenced to imprisonment for two months to date from 10 August 2010. The offences committed by the offender, after the date of the commission of the conspiracy are not to be taken into account for the purposes of imposing a heavier sentence, but may be considered for the purpose of deciding whether he is deserving of leniency. 

102The offender's criminal history does not entitle him to leniency but it is not such that it is a matter of aggravation.

103Andrew Perish did not give evidence during the trial or upon sentence. In a report dated 9 March 2012, W John Taylor, a forensic psychologist details the offender's family history. He is the fifth eldest child in the Perish family and like his brother Anthony, was raised on the family poultry farm at Leppington. The offender was close to his mother and very close to his grandfather. He left school at the age of 17 years after completing the Higher School Certificate examinations. He then completed a plumbing trade course at TAFE and obtained a certificate for the safe handling of chemicals. The offender was employed as an apprentice plumber with the Department of Public Works for about four years. After working as a plumbing sub-contractor for a couple of years, he commenced his own business contracting to farmers, working with a bobcat, slashing grass and other services. At the same time, he ran a beef feed lot and delivered his meat to butchers' shops for some seven or eight years. He then had a rural supply shop in Camden supplying produce and other goods to farmers until he went to prison in April 2007. 

104Mr Taylor recounts that the offender experienced a great deal of grief and trauma following his grandparents' murder. He had idolised his grandfather. His consumption of alcohol increased and he became intoxicated about twice a week and began inhaling speed and using ecstasy and cocaine. He said that he was ""self-medicating"".

105Whilst in prison, the offender has undertaken counselling and has completed the ""Enough is Enough"" program. Mr Taylor reports that the results of the psychometric tests that he administered, do not indicate that the offender has a personality disorder and that most of his attitudes appear to be pro-social. Mr Taylor is of the opinion that the offender has a low moderate risk of recidivism and has good prospects for rehabilitation. I take all these matters into account. 

106Consistent with his plea of not guilty, the offender has neither expressed nor shown contrition for the offence and no allowance can be made for those factors in mitigation. He, also, has not accepted responsibility for his actions, and his prospects of rehabilitation remain guarded. Notwithstanding the views expressed by Mr Taylor, I am unable to make a positive finding on the balance of probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. Nevertheless, as in the case of Anthony Perish, I conclude that the offender's motive to avenge his grandparents' murders, lessens the need for personal deterrence and protection of the community. 

107Mr Terracini did not submit that special circumstances exist that justifies a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence. 

108James Falconer the deceased's son read a victim impact statement to the court. The contents of the statement cannot be used by me to increase the offenders' sentences: R v Previtera (1997) 97 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.

109The parity principle is of importance when sentencing each of the offenders. I have compared their separate culpability and subjective circumstances. 

110In structuring the sentences to be imposed on Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton, I have fixed an appropriate sentence for each offence and then considered questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as totality. As these offenders actions in reality reflect one course of criminal conduct, I conclude that the sentence to be imposed for murder can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the conspiracy to murder. I do not accept the Crown's submission that there should be some partial accumulation of the sentences. 

111I am required to sentence the offenders in accordance with sentencing practice in 2001 and not as presently prevailing. Although the statutory maximum for the offences has not altered, it is evident from the tendered Judicial Commission sentencing statistics, that sentences have increased since the advent of standard non-parole periods in 2003. Standard non-parole periods have no application to the present sentences. I take into account the sentencing statistics, but each case depends on its own facts and circumstances. I believe the sentences I am about to impose are consistent with the sentencing range current at the time of the offending. 

112The agreed date for the commencement of Anthony Perish's sentence is 19 March 2009. As the offences were committed before 1 February 2003, the repealed section s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applies. I do not consider that ""special circumstances"" exist which justify the non-parole period being less than three-quarters of the term of imprisonment. 

113Anthony John Perish for the murder of Terrence Falconer, you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 24 years which is to commence on 19 March 2009 and is to expire on 18 March 2033. I fix a non-parole period of 18 years which is to commence on 19 March 2009 and is to expire on 18 March 2027. 

114Anthony John Perish for the conspiracy to murder Terrence Falconer, you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 14 years which is to commence on 19 March 2009 and is to expire on 18 March 2023 I fix a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months which is to commence on 19 March 2009 and is to expire on 18 September 2019. 

115The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 
18 March 2027. 

116The agreed date for the commencement of Matthew Lawton's sentence is 27 January 2009. I do not consider that ""special circumstances"" exist which justify the non-parole period being less than three-quarters of the term of imprisonment. 

117Matthew Lawton for the murder of Terrence Falconer, you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 20 years, which is to commence on 27 January 2009 and is to expire on 26 January 2029. I fix a non-parole period of 15 years which is to commence on 27 January 2009 and is to expire on 26 January 2024. 

118Matthew Lawton for the conspiracy to murder Terrence Falconer, you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 10 years which is to commence on 27 January 2009 and is to expire on 26 January 2019. I fix a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months which is to commence on 27 January 2009 and is to expire on 26 July 2016. 

119The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 
26 January 2024. 

120The agreed date for the commencement of Andrew Perish's sentence is 4 October 2010. I note that he had been serving sentences imposed in the District Court, the full term of which expired on 4 April 2012. No submission was made either by the Crown or Mr Terracini as to whether the present sentence should be imposed partially concurrently or consecutively upon the District Court sentences. It seems from the agreed date that both parties consider accumulation upon the first date Andrew Perish was eligible for release on parole after the service of the sentence imposed by Hock DCJ, to be appropriate. I do not disagree. In considering the principle of the totality of the criminality, such accumulation, in my view, adequately reflects the criminality of the offence of conspiracy to murder and the aggregate sentence is just and appropriate: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59, Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJ 616. I do not consider that ""special circumstances"" exist which justify the non-parole period being less than three-quarters of the term of imprisonment. 

121Andrew Michael Perish for the conspiracy to murder Terrance Falconer, you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 12 years which is to commence on 4 October 2010 and is to expire on 3 October 2022 I fix a non-parole period of 9 years which is to commence on 4 October 2010 and is to expire on 3 October 2019. 

122The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 
3 October 2019.

2759034,Minogue v Rudd [2012] NSWSC 305,"Judgment
Introduction
1The plaintiff claims damages against three defendants for serious injuries, including head injuries, he suffered when he fell from a height on a building site on 12 February 2004. The Court ordered that there be a separate hearing on liability: Minogue v Rudd [2011] NSWSC 966. These reasons and the orders that follow relate to liability only.
2It is common ground that the plaintiff fell from the ground floor to the basement of a dwelling which was under construction. There were no witnesses to the fall and the plaintiff has no recollection of how it happened or why he was in the area from which he fell.


Facts
The plaintiff
3The plaintiff was born on 5 August 1979 and was 24 at the date of the accident. He is now 32. He is a qualified carpenter and joiner. He completed his four-year apprenticeship in the Republic of Ireland and obtained a National Craft Certificate with merit dated 30 September 2003. He was an apprentice to a firm, a principal of which, Mr Cooney, deposed to the plaintiff's competence as a carpenter and his ability to work without much supervision. Mr Cooney's evidence was not challenged.
4Not long after the plaintiff qualified, he travelled to Australia on a working holiday. His friends advised him to apply for a business name, apparently on the basis it would help him obtain work if he had an Australian Business Number (ABN). He followed their advice and applied for, and registered, the business name ""A1 Carpentry"". Shortly after his arrival he began to do carpentry work, solely for the third defendant, the principal of which, Mr McWilliams, also engaged one of the plaintiff's friends, a concreter, who, like the plaintiff, came from County Clare.
The worksite
5The accident occurred on a residential property in Vaucluse owned by Mrs Rigby. The property was on a slope and had two street frontages: Coolong Road was at the lower level to the north and Wentworth Road was at the upper level to the south. There were two means of access to the ground floor: through an entry foyer on the western side and through a foyer on the southern side near the kitchen. The basement could be entered from outside through a cellar on the western side.
6Part of the residence had been demolished and was to be rebuilt. The work to be done was substantial and included, relevantly, construction of a laundry and kitchen and building an external decorative chimney.
7At all material times, the property was a construction site. It had fencing and red and white screening around its perimeter and a sign identifying Mr Rudd, the first defendant, as the builder. There were also signs which read:
""DANGER CONSTRUCTION SITEUNAUTHORISED PERSONS KEEP OUT""
8There was scaffolding around the southeast corner of the house where the kitchen area was, including outside the kitchen window. The building materials for the chimney, the timber and the blueboard, were stored on the ground outside the kitchen window on the other side of the scaffolding from the house.
The contract and building works
9Mr Rudd commenced work on the site on 4 August 2003. He was party to a building contract with Mrs Rigby. The contract nominated Mr Tilden, the second defendant, as a supervisor who had authority to act on her behalf.
10The kitchen area was 5.2 by 2.42 metres. There were two means of access to the kitchen area: the window and the door opening. The window, which was on the south of the building, was about one metre above the floor. The flooring in this area was to be constructed by RMC Construction Services Pty Limited (RMC) between late November 2003 and early January 2004. According to Mr Mori, RMC's principal, the job was not completed since one of the joists did not have a noggin (beams that run perpendicular to joists, between joists, to provide lateral stability) on the western side. Mr Mori's evidence was that the completion of the framing of the floor awaited a final decision as to the position of the stairs and the location of an air-conditioning unit. The last time Mr Mori was at the site was 5 January 2004.
11At some time during this period, Mr Mori suggested to Mr Rudd, who in turn made the suggestion to Mrs Rigby, that the whole of the ground floor should be covered with plywood. This would provide a further layer of flooring which would lie underneath the final layer of flooring. Mrs Rigby rejected this suggestion on the grounds of cost.
12Mr Rudd gave evidence that, at another stage, Mrs Rigby proposed a meeting in the kitchen area to which she would invite a designer and tradespeople who were likely to be engaged to fit out the kitchen. She suggested to Mr Rudd that it would be sufficient for some boards to be put down so that the meeting could be held in the area where the work was to be done. Mr Rudd told Mrs Rigby that it would be dangerous to have such a meeting in the kitchen until the floor was complete. Mrs Rigby did not recall such an exchange. I accept Mr Rudd's evidence, including the following:
""I would have said to Mrs Rigby that, you know, no one is to go in there until the flooring is in a condition where it can be done.""
13Mr Rudd contacted Mr Mori in early February 2004 to tell him that the next job for him to do was the external decorative chimney which was to be built about halfway down the eastern external side of the house and was to extend from ground level to the height of the building.
14In February 2004, Mr Rudd went on a short holiday to Canada. The last day on which he worked on the site before his departure was Friday 6 February 2004. He returned on about 17 February 2004. He expected that while he was away the only work that would be done on the building was the construction of the external chimney by RMC. He told Mrs Rigby that he would be away. He sent facsimiles to Mrs Rigby and Mr Tilden in the days before his departure setting out what needed to be done in the next stage of the renovation and a list of names and contact numbers for the various trades who worked on the site.  He identified Mr Mori as the carpenter.
15It appears from Mr Rudd's work diary for 6 February 2004 that scaffolders were on site on that day. This note is consistent with the evidence of Mr Bielik, who was engaged from time to time by Mrs Rigby to do work on the property.
16I accept Mr Rudd's evidence that before 6 February 2004, when he left on holidays, he arranged for hazard tape to be put up to bar the entrance to the kitchen area.
17When Mr Tilden learned that Mr Rudd was away, either directly from Mr Rudd himself or from Mrs Rigby, Mr Tilden took it upon himself to ensure that the decorative chimney was constructed in time to be rendered by a tradesman who was soon to become available for the job. Mrs Rigby trusted Mr Tilden, who saw himself as her representative, and agreed to his recommendation.
18On Monday 9 February 2004, Mr Tilden rang Mr Mori to ask when he could start building the chimney. There is some dispute, which does not need to be resolved, about precisely when Mr Mori could begin the work. Mr Tilden who was aware of Mrs Rigby's impatience with the progress of work decided to see if he could get someone else to start the job earlier. After he had spoken with Mr Mori, he rang Mr McWilliams. Because Mr McWilliams said that he could begin on Wednesday, Mr Tilden decided to engage the third defendant, rather than RMC, to do the work. Mr Tilden arranged to meet Mr McWilliams on the site that Monday. Mr Rudd did not become aware that the third defendant had been engaged until his return from holidays on about 17 February 2004 and learned of the accident. 
19On Monday 9 February 2004, Mr Tilden gave Mr McWilliams drawings that indicated the dimensions of the chimney and where it was to be constructed. Mr Tilden showed him around the outside of the site and took him into the entrance on the southern side of the house to show him the stairs that led from the ground floor to the first floor, which could be used to carry the sheets of blueboard up to the first floor in order to construct the chimney at that level.
20On Wednesday 11 February 2004 the plaintiff, together with Mr McWilliams, began work on the site. The work at ground floor level could be conducted from the ground. However, the work at higher levels necessitated the use of the scaffolding on the southern and eastern sides of the house.  By the end of the day they had substantially completed the wooden formwork structure to which the blueboard sheets would be affixed. 
The accident
21On the following day, Thursday 12 February 2004 the plaintiff returned to the site with Mr McWilliams again and did some work, which probably included completing the wooden formwork for the chimney. 
22Mrs Rigby also visited the site on the morning of 12 February 2004 at 7.30 am, although she did not encounter either Mr McWilliams or Mr Minogue. She came with Mr Hardwick and Mr Bloodworth, both of whom were to perform electrical work, including the installation of lighting in the kitchen area, on the site at a later date. They did not enter the kitchen area because it was blocked off with hazard tape and plywood.
23On that morning Mr Bielik was moving sandstone in the garden. He observed both the plaintiff and Mr McWilliams working together on the site.
24Mr McWilliams' evidence, which I accept, was that he left the site at about 9.00 am to go to North Sydney to drop off material and left the plaintiff to work by himself. By that stage the wooden formwork had been completed and the blueboard needed to be cut and affixed to it. 
25At about 10.30 am on 12 February 2004, Mr Bielik heard a sound of ""falling timber"" and a scream. He ran to the residence, jumped down about a metre or so into the cellar and ran into the laundry area where he found the plaintiff faced down and bleeding on the floor. The plaintiff suffered serious traumatic head injury and other injuries. Due to these injuries the plaintiff is unable to recall what happened on the day of the accident.
26Very shortly afterwards, Mr McWilliams returned to the site. He heard Mr Bielik calling out for help and came into the house at the ground floor level through the foyer on the southern side, past the stairs to the first floor and the entrance to the kitchen area and down the stairs from the living room to the mezzanine where the dining room was. He leapt down from there to the laundry where Mr Bielik was trying to help the plaintiff. The evidence of Mr Bielik suggests that Mr McWilliams might have been in the kitchen area as he heard Mr McWilliams calling ""from above"". However, the observation that he was ""above"" is consistent with Mr McWilliams having been in the dining room on the mezzanine level which was visible from, but higher than, the cellar, where the plaintiff and Mr Bielik were. I accept Mr McWilliams' evidence that he did not go into the kitchen area at all.
27Police and ambulance officers and a construction rescue unit arrived at the site and the plaintiff was transported to hospital. Mr McWilliams went to the hospital separately in his own car.
28At around midday on the day of the accident, WorkCover inspectors, Senior Inspector Waterhouse and Senior Inspector Macready, attended the site to investigate. They took photographs and later took statements. Senior Inspector Waterhouse arrived at about noon and Senior Inspector Macready arrived about an hour later.  Much of that report, some of the statements and all of the photographs are in evidence.
29The flooring in the kitchen was incomplete. There were joists which had been skew-nailed to the top-plates. Skew nailing is a term that describes the process of putting a nail into the joist at an angle towards its base so that the wall plate is penetrated. If this technique were not used, a substantially longer nail would be required to take account of the height of the joist.
30There were also noggins between all joists but one. Noggins were not required by the applicable standard.  At the time of the WorkCover inspection on 12 February 2004, one of the joists was at an angle and rested on top of the contiguous joist, which left a gap wider than the 400 millimetre span between the other joists. The WorkCover inspectors noticed that the top plate on the northern wall, to which the joist which was on an angle had previously been skew nailed, had an area slightly larger than the width of the joist which was free of dust. They also noticed that the two skewnails that had presumably affixed the joist to the top plate were still in situ in the top plate and were not deformed. The corresponding area on the joist was damaged which is consistent with there being a crack which would permit the nails to be extracted from the joist (to permit it to be pivoted) without deforming the nails.
31There were boards resting on some of the joists in the kitchen area. Unlike the top of the joists, the boards were not covered in dust. The WorkCover inspectors noted that the boards appeared to have been recently swept. 
32Photographs taken by WorkCover depict an electrical cord looped over a joist in the kitchen area which extended down to the basement area to a temporary sub-board located about 1200 millimetres above the floor. At the time of the WorkCover inspection the power switch was on and the power cord energised. No power tools were located by the WorkCover investigators in the kitchen area or the laundry area, being the areas where their investigation was concentrated.
33A green carpenter's bag and a black pouch were found in the laundry area. The plaintiff gave unchallenged evidence that he wore these on his belt when he was working and removed them only occasionally when they were in the way. Their location is consistent with the emergency officers having removed the plaintiff's clothing in order to treat him. Three T-shirts were also found in the vicinity. One T-shirt had embroidered on the pocket ""DMW Carpentry Services Pty Limited"" and was soaked in what appeared to be blood; the other had ""Kangaroos next 5 km"" on the front and also appeared to be soaked in blood. The third was damp, black and had aboriginal motifs on the back.
34Although Mr McWilliams had a theory that the plaintiff might have left his nail bag on the kitchen window, gone into the kitchen to retrieve it, and it had ended up on the laundry floor, I regard this as no more than speculation. Indeed Mr McWilliams does not suggest that it is any more than that.
35WorkCover found a noggin on the laundry floor. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this piece of timber was what Mr Bielik heard when he heard ""timber falling"".
The plaintiff's case
The pleaded case: the plaintiff fell through a loose joist
36The plaintiff's case as pleaded is:
(1)At 10.30 am on 12 February 2004 the plaintiff was crossing the kitchen area in the course of his carpentry work for the third defendant;
(2)The flooring of the kitchen area was only partly constructed and consisted of joists and noggins;
(3)As at December 2003 at least one of the joists in the kitchen area had been left loose in that its southern end was skew nailed to the adjacent wall plate but its northern end was not skew nailed to its adjacent wall plate;
(4)Because the northern end of this joist was not skew-nailed, the joist was capable of moving laterally if trodden upon thereby creating the risk that any worker who trod on the joist would fall and suffer significant injury;
(5)The fact that the northern end of the joist was not skew-nailed and was capable of movement if trodden on was, on or prior to 12 February 2004, something which each of the defendants knew or ought to have known.
37The plaintiff pleads that the accident occurred in the following way:
""The Plaintiff while walking on the joists, stepped onto a joist, the northern end of which had been left loose and unnailed and which was not bilaterally braced with noggins kept securely in position by skew nails, with the results that the northern end of the joist moved about 1m westward under the Plaintiff's foot, causing him to lose his balance and fall, striking his head on a joist and then falling a distance of 2.93 ms between the joists to the concrete floor of the laundry one floor below, striking his head on the floor.
As a result of the Plaintiff losing his balance, striking his head on a joist, and falling to the concrete floor below, the Plaintiff was injured.""
38Both the plaintiff and the third defendant submitted that I should infer that the accident happened as the plaintiff has pleaded. The third defendant had an interest in establishing that the fall was as a result of a single loose joist or loose joists rather than merely uncovered joists per se, which might be seen to be more the first defendant's responsibility than the third defendant's. To that extent the plaintiff's and the third defendant's interests coincided on this issue.
39The third defendant submitted that Mr Bielik was only on site when Mr Rudd was there on one day, 6 February 2004. Mr Bielik has deposed that at some time, Mr Rudd spoke to him about not walking over the joists in the kitchen area. Mr Bielik said that he felt that the joists were loose underfoot and that he was holding onto the wall as he walked across them. The third defendant submitted that this amounts to direct evidence of the instability in the joist or joists which explains why the plaintiff, who was a carpenter experienced in walking on joists at heights and who was agile, would fall. The third defendant submitted that this would elevated that possibility to a probability which would be sufficient to outweigh all the other speculative matters raised by the first defendant.
40The third defendant's submission is encapsulated by the following passage from its senior counsel's address:
""But if your Honour is asked to evaluate the probabilities of someone with skills, experience and physical characteristics and abilities of the plaintiff, somehow just falling off the stable platform, as opposed to the likelihood of his fall being caused by standing on a joist which Mr Bielik described as being loose and unstable underfoot, your Honour would have no difficulty in our submission in inferring that the loose, unstable joist moved under his foot and that caused him to lose his balance and fall, on the probabilities.""
41In my view the difficulty with these submissions is that they depend entirely on Mr Bielik's recollection of the conversation with Mr Rudd after he had apparently walked on the relevant joists, namely those in the kitchen area. Mr Bielik was interviewed by police on the day of the accident. He then, to use his word, ""suppressed"" his memory of the accident and never returned to the site because of the trauma associated with finding the plaintiff and believing him to be dead. Before he went to the police station he had consumed a quantity of Bourbon to calm his nerves and alleviate the shock. His evidence about the conversation with Mr Rudd was given to an investigator who interviewed him on behalf of the third defendant in March 2012, over eight years after the relevant events. Mr Rudd could not recall having such a conversation but did not deny that it occurred.
42I am prepared to accept that Mr Bielik had a conversation with Mr Rudd about some joists. But I do not accept that he had such a conversation in the terms he deposed to the investigator in March 2012. I do not accept that Mr Bielik could remember the conversation with that degree of particularity after the passage of such a long period of time. The first defendant's cross-examination of Mr Bielik revealed how hazy his memory of those events was. Indeed at one point he agreed that it was his impression that the joists on which he was walking had not even been nailed down. If this impression was correct, then he would have been in the area before RMC had even skew nailed the joists to the top plate.
43Mr Rudd gave oral evidence that he walked on the joists after RMC had nailed them and he did not consider that any joist was loose.  He said that he arranged for the hazard tape to be put up because the flooring was incomplete and that it was dangerous for anyone who was not actually working on joists to be walking across them. He said:
""People shouldn't really be walking on the joists unless they are actually working, you know, you know constructing them.  I mean, you know, it's a hazardous area.  You could step in between them or, you know, you wouldn't need a joist to roll over to have an accident.""
44The third defendant sought to impugn Mr Rudd's credibility in cross-examination by putting the following interrogatory and answer to him and highlighting an inconsistency between his answer and his oral evidence:
""Interrogatory:Before the accident on 12 February 2004 did you believe that the subject joist or any other joist in the kitchen could move if trodden on?
Answer:On 6 February 2004, I was aware that a noggin had not been put in place between the final and second last joist and believed that the joist could roll if weight was put on it.  It is for this reason that I ensured that the red and white tape barricading the area and the 'Keep Out' sign were put up before I went on leave."" [Emphasis added]
45There are difficulties in using interrogatories, which tend to be drafted by solicitors, as amounting to prior inconsistent statements, particularly when the witness, as in Mr Rudd's case, is not as attuned to the nuances of language as lawyers might consider themselves to be. I do not consider that Mr Rudd's credibility suffered from the exchange and I accept his response in the following passage:
""Well okay.  I mean, you know, you can twist it that way, but I think when you see the whole picture, you know, the whole area was unsafe.  I mean people shouldn't be walking across joists, you know, without some kind of flooring on them.""
46The third defendant also relied on the plaintiff's evidence as to how the accident occurred, notwithstanding the plaintiff's general lack of recollection. He cross-examined the plaintiff about certain statements he had made to an investigator which are recorded in a statement he signed on 7 June 2004. Although the plaintiff does not recall the circumstances of his making the statement to the investigator it appears that it was obtained by and for the workers' compensation insurer, although the plaintiff's signature to that document was obtained by his own solicitor.
47The third defendant put the following statements to the plaintiff from his statement of 7 June 2004, with which he agreed:
""I remembered the existence of uncovered joists in the house.
However I do remember that they [the joists] were uncovered and that they were loose.""
48There is a deal of ingenuity, if not sophistry, in what the third defendant has endeavoured to do with the plaintiff's statement of 7 June 2004. I do not accept that the plaintiff was able to distinguish between what he had been told and what he recalled at that time. Although the plaintiff was being cross-examined by a party whose interests could be expected to be adverse, the third defendant was, for the reasons set out above, endeavouring to establish the plaintiff's pleaded case, and in so doing implicate the first defendant. I gained the impression in the following passage from the plaintiff's cross-examination that the plaintiff was embarrassed that he had signed a statement that appeared to make distinctions which he himself was not able to make:
""Q.  Do you see from your reading of those few paragraphs that again, like you did in the earlier statement, you were careful to distinguish between what you remembered and what you didn't remember?A.  Yeah. 
Q.  And also what you thought from having reconstructed things in your mind from what other people had told you?A.  True. 
Q.  And in paragraph 16, for example, you say, 'I don't remember the exact mechanics of what happened'.  Do you see that? A.  True. 
Q.  And you say, 'However, I remembered the existence of uncovered joists in the house'?A.  True, yeah. 
Q.  So that's a statement of something that you did remember at the time, as opposed to something you put together from what other people told you? A.  Probably.  I'm not sure."" [Emphasis added.]
49In reply to this evidence, the plaintiff tendered the following additional passage from his statement dated 22 November 2011 which was prepared for these proceedings:
""I do not remember anything in relation to the joists or what they were like before I fell. I have only been able to give information about these subjects by repeating what I understand from what Declan [McWilliams] has told us since the accident.""
50I have also had regard to a bundle of medical evidence tendered by the plaintiff, who has identified the passages relied upon in his written submissions. Much of the material relates to the plaintiff's present memory functioning rather than any amnesia surrounding the time of the accident. However, some passages are directed to the issue of memory of the accident, including the following:
[Report of Dr Leng, neuropsychologist, London, following a consultation with the plaintiff in January 2007, at the request of the plaintiff's solicitors]
""He told me he was amnesic for the accident itself. He was unsure what his last memory was before the accident. I asked him whether he could remember being in Australia before the accident occurred, and he said that he had snapshots of memory for the preceding 3-month period. His first memory after the accident is of seeing his brother, but he does not know how much time had elapsed...
The likely initial severity of a traumatic brain injury is normally best judged from the period of post-traumatic amnesia, and here is was documented to have been over three weeks. In clinical terms this means a very severe traumatic brain injury, very likely to produce persisting neurocognitive and neurobehavioural consequences of practical significance.""
51The third defendant has directed my attention to other passages in the bundle, including the following history given to Dr Buckley on 3 June 2004 which is recorded in a report of 2 July 2004:
""Mr Minogue told me that he does not remember the accident. He remembers the morning of the day finishing off the construction of a chimney.""
52I accept the evidence of the plaintiff that he does not recall either the circumstance of the accident or the surrounding circumstances, including the condition of the joists. In coming to this conclusion I have taken into account not only the medical evidence about the seriousness of the head injury the plaintiff suffered but also the evidence of the plaintiff, and my impression of the way he gave it, which is set out above.
53I do not accept that Mr Rudd was on notice of any instability in the subject joist or joists. Although he would have been aware, had he inspected it, that there was a single joist which did not have a noggin on one side, I am not prepared to infer from this that the joist was unstable, or that Mr Rudd ought to have been aware that it was. The evidence is that joists at that height and of those dimensions do not require noggins. I find, accordingly, that the subject joist was not unstable by reason of any lack of noggin on one side, or otherwise.
The cause and mechanics of the fall
54Three experts, Mr Cowling, Mr Heathcote and Mr Dubos, prepared reports which were served in these proceedings and tendered as evidence. There were numerous objections to those reports. None of the reports complied with the rules of evidence, either because the assumptions were not identified, the experts engaged in conjecture and speculation or because they went beyond their expertise: Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588. The parties requested, and I agreed, that rather than take up court time with ruling on these objections, I should take in the expert reports as assumptions unless I was satisfied that the opinion was properly based and within its author's expertise.
55The experts were called and gave their evidence concurrently. There was substantial agreement in their views. Their evidence was to the following effect.
56The plaintiff's injuries were not such as to permit an inference to be drawn as to the cause or mechanics of the fall. Nor does the joist which is on an angle assist in solving these questions. It is unlikely that it moved during the fall since its position on top of the contiguous joist is inconsistent with a downward force and its undamaged regular appearance is inconsistent with any involvement in the fall. Although it may be implicated in that its position opened up a greater gap than there would have been had it been located parallel to the contiguous joists, it is a matter of speculation whether the plaintiff fell through that gap, although he might have done, having regard to where he landed.
Findings as to how the accident occurred
57I accept the consensus of the experts that neither the probable cause nor the probable mechanics of the fall, nor where the plaintiff was probably standing when he fell, can be determined. I consider the instant case to be in a similar category to that considered in Lithgow City Council v Jackson [2011] HCA 36; 85 ALJR 1130. I do not regard the hypothesis advanced by Mr Gross QC, senior counsel for the plaintiff, as to how the plaintiff fell to be at all self-evident. I reject his submission that:
""So it is fairly obvious that the plaintiff ends up going through the wider gap head first and landing on his head.""
58Where no expert called by any party was able to say why and how the plaintiff fell, I do not consider myself to be able, by the application of so-called ""common sense"", my experience of ordinary life, or otherwise, to fill the gap.
59Both the plaintiff and the third defendant submitted that the plaintiff was a young, fit, agile man who was accustomed to walking on uncovered joists and that if he fell, it was probably because of a defect in the joists rather than any other reason. I reject this submission, which appears to be based on ""tendency"" rather than anything else and is a non sequitur.
60The third defendant also referred me to Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd v Forst [1940] HCA 45; 64 CLR 538 (Forst's Case) and contended that I am permitted to infer on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff fell because of a loose joist. In that case a worker performed two strenuous tasks and then collapsed and died of coronary thrombosis. There was expert evidence, which was accepted by the arbitrator, to the effect that death from coronary thrombosis could not generally be related to exertion. The Supreme Court of South Australia overturned the arbitrator's finding and the employer appealed to the High Court. The High Court dismissed the appeal. Rich ACJ said, at 563-564:
""I do not see why a court should not begin its investigation, i.e., before hearing any medical testimony, from the standpoint of presumptive inference which this sequence of events would naturally inspire in the mind of any common-sense person uninstructed in pathology. When he finds that a workman of the not-so-young standing attempts in a posture calculated by reason of the pressure on the stomach to disturb or arrest the rhythm of the heart a very strenuous task not forming part of his ordinary work and then collapses almost immediately and dies from a heart condition, why should not a court say that here is a strong ground for a preliminary presumption of fact in favour of the view that the work materially contributed to the cause of death?""
61This dicta has subsequently been distilled into the proposition that an inability to call lay or expert evidence that shows the precise way that something has happened is not fatal: see Bendix Mintex Pty Limited v Barnes (1997) 42 NSWLR 307 at 317, per Mason P. I do not consider the ""presumptive inference"" in Forst's Case to have any immediate bearing on the instant case. The proof of causation in Forst's Case did not depend on anything about which the worker (had he survived) was capable of giving evidence. A mere description of what he was doing when he collapsed and later died, was sufficient to give rise to the presumptive inference of a causal link.
62As Mr McWilliams said, of walking on uncovered joists: ""you can never be complacent.""  Regrettably, able, fit, agile, qualified tradespeople, including carpenters, fall from joists in which there is no defect. For the reasons given below, there is no room for the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in the instant case.
63I consider it to be a matter of speculation as to why the plaintiff fell. He may have slipped, tripped, fainted or simply missed his footing. I do not consider the hypothesis that he lost his balance on a loose joist to be more probable than other possibilities. I do not consider that the evidence as to the cause or mechanics of the fall to rise above the level of conjecture: see the cases cited in Condos v Clycut Pty Limited [2009] NSWCA 200 at [68], per McColl JA (Campbell and Macfarlan JJA agreeing).
64It follows that the plaintiff has failed to prove his case as pleaded above. However, as the case was conducted on a broader basis than is revealed by the pleading I propose to determine the case on this broader basis rather than simply find that the plaintiff fails against each defendant because he has not proved that the accident occurred in the way alleged in his pleading.
The alternative case: the dangerous condition of the kitchen
65The alternative argument put by the plaintiff appears to be that it does not matter how the plaintiff fell, or what he was doing in the kitchen area, because the first or second defendant were responsible for the dangerous condition of the kitchen area and the third defendant was responsible for the work being performed by the plaintiff.
66Many of the particulars of negligence are identical for each defendant. They can be summarised as follows:
(1) Particulars against all defendants:
(a)Failure to make sure that each joist was securely braced by noggins;
(b)Failure to warn the plaintiff of a loose joist;
(c)Failure to prevent access to area where the loose joist was;
(d)Failure to provide netting or safety harnesses;
(e)Breaches of clauses 34, 35, 36, 38, 39(a) and 39(e) of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation (OH&S Regulation) which govern the person who is the ""controller"" of the premises;
(f)Failure to ensure that the plaintiff had a site specific induction prior to commencing work in which their attention was drawn to the loose joist in the kitchen area.
(2) Additional particulars against the first defendant:
(a)Breaches of clauses 56, 213(1), 213(2), 226, 227, 234(1) and 234(2) of the OH&S Regulation;
(b)Failure to ensure that the third defendant had a site specific induction prior to commencing work in which their attention was drawn to the loose joist in the kitchen area.
(3) Additional particulars against the second defendant:
(a)Breaches of clauses 56, 234(1) and 234(2) of the OH&S Regulation;
(b)Failure to ensure that the third defendant had a site specific induction prior to commencing work in which their attention was drawn to the loose joist in the kitchen area.
67Section 10 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (OH&S Act) requires controllers of premises to ensure that the premises are safe and without risks to health. Parts 4.2 and 4.3 of the OH&S Regulation (in which clauses 34, 35, 36, 38, 39(a), 39(e) are to be found) impose absolute (in the sense that they are not qualified by reasonableness) duties on controllers with respect to work premises and their use to do the following:
(1)Identify hazards: cl 34;
(2)Assess risks: cl 35;
(3)Eliminate risks, or, if they cannot be eliminated, control them: cl 36;
(4)Provide information to other persons who have responsibilities: cl 38;
(5)Ensure that safe access is provided to all parts of a place to which a person may require access and from which a person may fall: cl 39(a);
(6)Ensure that floors are designed to be safe without risks of falls with appropriate floor coverings (if necessary).
68Clause 56 imposes an obligation on an employer to ensure control of risk of fall from heights. Clauses 213(1), 213(2), 226, 227, 234(1) and 234(2) impose obligations on principal contractors to ensure OH&S training is undertaken, OH&S matters are managed and that structures do not collapse.
69Mr Gross made much of these alleged breaches. His submissions were, effectively, that the content of the duty of care was informed by the regulatory framework that surrounded the workplace and that such breaches of statutory duty amounted to negligence. Although he conceded that cl 36 of the OH&S Regulation would not, of itself, give rise to a private cause of action for breach of statutory duty because of its generality, he pressed it as a particular of negligence. However, he contended that a breach of cl 39, which governed fall prevention, did give rise to a private cause of action for breach of statutory duty.
70The plaintiff based his negligence case, in part, on an alleged breach of cl 36 and said that the first defendant was obliged to eliminate the risk of the plaintiff falling by putting down floorboards. He submitted that the option of controlling the risk by putting up a barricade was only open to a defendant if the risk could not be eliminated. 
71The plaintiff appeared to place some reliance on the following paragraph in Leighton Contractors Pty Limited v Fox [2009] HCA 35; 240 CLR 1 where the High Court (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Bell JJ) said, at 19:
""No claim for breach of statutory duty. The case against Leighton and Downview was not pleaded as involving breach of statutory duty. No doubt this was because the terms of the OHS Act prevent the duties imposed by it on employers and others giving rise to correlative private rights.""
72The plaintiff contended that neither this passage nor the Act said anything about whether a breach of the Regulations would give rise to a private cause of action.
73However, as the High Court observed in the footnote to the passage from Leighton quoted above, s 39A had not been enacted when Mr Fox was injured. Section 39A, which was inserted into the OH&S Act by the Workers Compensation Legislation Amendment Act 2003, relevantly commenced on 1 August 2003. The relevant legislation was summarised by the High Court in the footnote as follows:
""Section 32(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) provides that nothing in Pt 2 is to be construed as conferring a right of action in any civil proceedings in respect of any contravention, whether by act or omission, of any provision of Pt 2; s 46(2) provides that a person is not liable to any civil or criminal proceedings by reason only that the person has failed to observe an approved industry code of practice. [Section 39A of the Act] makes provision for the regulations to provide that nothing in a specified provision or provisions of the regulations is to be construed as conferring a right of action in any civil proceedings in respect of any contravention, whether by act or omission, of the provision or provisions but that the failure of the regulations so to provide is not to be construed as conferring a right of action..."" [Emphasis added]
74Section 39A remained in force until 30 June 2005 when it was repealed by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005. Accordingly it was in force at the time of the plaintiff's accident. I reject the plaintiff's submission that he has a private action based on breach of statutory duty in respect of Regulation 39. It is not open to the plaintiff in light of s 39A of the OH&S Act.
75None of the parties contended that there was an implied repeal of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (the Act) by the OH&S Act and Regulations. Accordingly, it is not necessary for me to determine the questions expressly left open by the Court of Appeal in Wynn Tresidder Management Pty Limited v Barkho [2009] NSWCA 149 at [87]-[101], per McColl JA (Tobias and Young JJA agreeing) including whether there is such an implied repeal.
76This case has been conducted on the basis that the defendants' liability to the plaintiff, if any, for negligence, is governed by the provisions of the Act which are considered in more detail below. Although the Regulations to which the plaintiff has referred are relevant to the question of negligence, a breach of any of the regulations referred to will not necessarily amount to negligence, since, unlike the obligations imposed by the Regulations, the duty and standard of care are moderated by the standard of reasonableness.
77In Leighton, the High Court considered the relationship between breaches of statutory duty and the law of negligence.  The Court said, at 22:
""The obligation imposed on Leighton under the Regulation, while not founding an action for breach of statutory duty, is central to the Court of Appeal's conclusion that a common law duty existed. While it is true that obligations under statutory or other enactments have relevance to determining the existence and scope of a duty, it is necessary to exercise caution in translating the obligations imposed on employers, principal contractors and others under the OHS Act and the Regulation into a duty of care at common law. This is because, as Gummow J explained in Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) v Dederer [(2007) 234 CLR 330 at 345 [43]; [2007] HCA 42], 'whatever their scope, all duties of care are to be discharged by the exercise of reasonable care. They do not impose a more stringent or onerous burden'.""
78For this reason I do not propose to make findings as to whether any defendant is a ""controller of premises"" within the meaning of the Regulations, or whether any particular regulation has been breached by any one or more of the defendants, since this exercise will not advance the task I have to undertake of determining whether any one or more of the defendants is liable in negligence to the plaintiff.
79On the final day of the hearing, at the commencement of his oral submissions, Mr Gross, submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the second and third defendants were entitled to judgment on the plaintiff's claim and that he sought judgment only against the first defendant. 
80However, later in the day, Mr Gross retracted that submission and said that his primary case was against the first defendant but that he also pressed his case against the other two defendants.
81Nonetheless, the plaintiff's written submissions contained the following passage, from which Mr Gross did not resile:
""Neither Mr McWilliams nor the plaintiff were at fault in relation to the absence of temporary flooring, or the absence of the noggin, both of which caused the plaintiff to suffer injury.""
82Although Mr Gross ultimately pressed the plaintiff's case against the second and third defendants, the most powerful and detailed submissions as to their respective liabilities were made by the first defendant in support of his cross-claims against them.


The existence of hazard tape
83In light of the alternative case put by the plaintiff (that the first or third defendants were responsible for the dangerous condition of the kitchen), a factual dispute emerged as to whether there was any hazard tape or plywood across the entrance to the kitchen area and when and by whom it was removed.
84The plaintiff's case was that there was neither hazard tape nor plywood across the kitchen opening. The plaintiff relied on the fact that by the time the WorkCover inspectors came at about midday, there was no evidence of either the plywood barricade or the hazard tape. The plaintiff also relied on what Mr McWilliams said to Senior Inspector Waterhouse on 22 March 2004 when asked how the accident could have been prevented:
""The floor should have been completed with a covering or cordoned off so that people can't enter the area.""
85The plaintiff submitted that Mr McWilliams' answer was inconsistent with the presence of a cordon.
86The first defendant's case was that there was both hazard tape and plywood across the entrance to the kitchen area. He relied on the evidence of Mrs Rigby and Mr Hardwick to that effect.
87Mr Rudd's recollection was that there was hazard tape and a sign that said ""KEEP OUT"" which faced outwards from the entrance. He did not recall whether there was also a piece of plywood across the entrance. Nor did he recall whether he asked Mr Bielik to do this or someone else. Mr Bielik did not recall doing this himself. 
88Mr Rudd's evidence as to the cordon was challenged on the basis that he had not told WorkCover about the presence of the cordon. His response, which I accept as being credible and reasonable in the circumstances, was:
""I wasn't asked about it.""
89On the day of the accident Mrs Rigby saw the lawyers who had advised her with respect to the building contract to notify them of what had happened. She denied, and I accept her denial, that she saw them because she considered herself to be exposed to a claim. Her lawyer advised her to prepare a file note which recorded her observations of access to the kitchen area that morning on the site visit. The following day she prepared a file note, which she and Mr Hardwick signed. It read as follows:
""On the morning of 12 February 2004 at approximately 7.30 am I had a site meeting with Brad Bloodworth and Kevin Hardwick of ICS.  We went through the various rooms in the house to discuss lighting and electrical needs.  We did not enter the kitchen area as it was taped off with red tape and a piece of plywood was placed over the entrance which prevented us from entering the kitchen.  We knew not to enter the kitchen.""
90Although neither Mrs Rigby, nor Mr Hardwick, could remember how the area appeared at the time they gave their evidence, they swore that when they signed the file note, they were satisfied that it reflected their observations on the previous morning.
91Mr McWilliams recalled that there was hazard tape across the entrance to the kitchen, which he said was in two strands, one at the height of slightly more than a metre and the other at the height of slightly less than a metre. He could not recall whether there was plywood there as well or whether there was a sign in addition to the hazard tape. Mr McWilliams denied that he removed it so that he could come into the kitchen area when he heard the cry for help from Mr Bielik. He was adamant that he had not jumped from the level of the kitchen to the basement below. I accept Mr McWilliams' evidence that he did not go into the kitchen area at all.
92Although Mr Bielik could, in other circumstances, be expected to be the most reliable witness if indeed he was the one who did the work of putting up the hazard tape and/ or the plywood, he was so affected by the plaintiff's fall that I do not find his evidence to be as reliable as that of the file note signed by Mrs Rigby and Mr Hardwick. Mr Bielik was interviewed by police on the afternoon of the accident but he was not asked about access to the kitchen area. He was not interviewed by WorkCover. He was not required to recall what had occurred until March 2012, when a statement was prepared in conjunction with the plaintiff's solicitors. As referred to above he had tried to ""suppress"" his memories of that day because it had been so distressing for him.  He never returned to the site.
93I accept Mrs Rigby and Mr Hardwick's evidence on this matter. They were relevantly disinterested in that neither believed that they were exposed either to the risk of a claim by the plaintiff or a WorkCover prosecution. Furthermore they made the observation of the entrance to the kitchen at a time shortly before the accident. Neither was immediately affected by the shock of the trauma. The file note was prepared the day afterwards when their observations of the previous day were still fresh in their memories.
94I am satisfied that the cordon tape and the plywood barricade were in situ at least until Mr McWilliams left the site at 9.00 am on 12 February 2004. I make no finding as to the identity of the person or persons who removed it, or the reason why it was removed, since the evidence does not permit of anything more than speculation on these matters.
The case against Mr Rudd, the first defendant
95In substance, the plaintiff's case against the first defendant, as it developed in the course of the hearing, was that he was negligent to leave the kitchen area in an unfinished state from early January 2004, when RMC left the site, until 12 February 2004 when the accident occurred and that, as occupier he had a duty either to cover the joists with floorboards or to erect a barricade such that it was physically impossible for anyone to come into the kitchen area through the door opening or the window. The plaintiff submitted that in any event the hazard tape was inadequate and any warning sign should have specified with particularity that there was a loose joist in the kitchen area.
96The plaintiff's submissions on the first defendant's obligations are encapsulated in the following submission made by Mr Gross:
""No matter how you frame the conjectural possibilities from the range of what he may or may not have been doing, you still end up with the same answer.  If, as all the experts say and is obvious, can I say, you have got the temporary flooring across, it is going to save a plaintiff who is walking in whatever direction, whether he is curious or performing his job very specifically there or dancing an Irish jig, it doesn't matter.  He is protected.  He is a person who is foreseeably in there and there is an obligation to protect.""
97The first defendant submitted that he did not owe any duty of care to the plaintiff since he did not know, or have reason to expect, that the third defendant or the plaintiff would be coming onto the site at all. The first defendant submitted that he had no reason to believe that anyone other than RMC would be engaged to construct the decorative chimney and RMC knew, better than anyone else, what the state of the kitchen area was since it had constructed it.
98I reject this submission. In my view the first defendant's role as the builder on the site and his capacity to control the site, even in his absence by appropriate barriers and warning signs, were sufficient to impose a duty of care on him. Although I accept Mr Rudd's evidence that he was only expecting RMC and the renderer to come on to the site in his absence in February 2004, he conceded in cross-examination that there was a real prospect that other tradespeople would come onto the site during his absence for various work purposes, including the making of preliminary observations or preparations.
99The first defendant's liability, if any, to the plaintiff is governed by the Act. Section 5B provides that a party is not negligent for failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless the risk was foreseeable, not insignificant and in the circumstances a reasonable person in the position of the first defendant would have taken those precautions.
100I reject the first defendant's submission that the risk that anyone would enter the kitchen area while he was away was either insignificant or not foreseeable. Although Mr Rudd considered that the kitchen area could not be completed while he was away and that the only work to be done on the site was the construction of the external decorative chimney, he must have been aware that Mrs Rigby was anxious for the property to be completed and had previously suggested that she would like to bring persons into the kitchen area to measure up the kitchen so that they could provide quotations and, perhaps, prepare cupboards or other fit-out offsite. Although Mr Rudd had substantial control over the site, he knew that, from time to time, Mrs Rigby and Mr Tilden exercised their authority to bring people onto the site.
101For these reasons I consider that the first defendant owed a duty of care to persons who came onto the site, including the plaintiff. 
102The first defendant took the precaution of arranging for hazard tape and plywood to be erected at the entrance to the kitchen to warn people of the dangers of entry and to bar entry.
103The precautions that the plaintiff submitted the first defendant failed to take were first, that he did not cover the joists with flooring, and secondly, that he did not erect a physical barricade over the entrance and the window.
104Accordingly, s 5B of the Act requires me to determine whether, in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the first defendant's position would have taken those precautions.
105The kitchen area was a dangerous area because the joists were not covered.
106As to the danger posed by the pivoting of the joist such that it rested on the contiguous joist and left a greater gap than would have been created had the joists been parallel, there is insufficient evidence for me to make a finding as to when this danger was created. I consider that, on the balance of probabilities, the gap created after Mr Rudd left for his holiday and that whoever moved the joist did so notwithstanding the hazard tape and the plywood barricade.
107I find that the putting up of hazard tape and a plywood barricade was sufficient to discharge any duty of care that Mr Rudd, the first defendant, owed the plaintiff to warn him of dangers in the kitchen area. I do not consider that a reasonable person in the first defendant's position would have either barricaded the door entrance and the window or covered the kitchen floor with plywood. The premises were a construction site and their fencing and signage around the perimeter made this clear. The plaintiff was a qualified carpenter who was not engaged to do any work associated with the construction of the kitchen area. In my view hazard tape and plywood was sufficient warning to such a person to keep out of the area.
108The plaintiff admitted as much in the following passage:
""Q.  For you as a carpenter engaged in building construction work, what significance would yellow and black hazard tape be to you? A.  Keep out mainly.""
109The plaintiff gave a somewhat inconsistent answer after the luncheon adjournment while he was still giving his evidence in chief in the following terms:
""Q.  From your observations, what was the hazard tape being used for?A.  Mainly to warn people that maybe that owned the house to keep them out of the area.  Myself, like I'm a qualified trades person, I assess an area and go through it.  I would be used to walking on that.""
110There is no evidence that persons whose entry was unlikely to be dissuaded by hazard tape and plywood, such as children or vagrants whose capacity to reason might be compromised, ever came to the premises. Had such persons been in the reasonable contemplation of a person in the position of the first defendant, the failure to take greater precautions may have been unreasonable. However, that is not the instant case.
111I have also had regard to the principles in s 5C of the Act. In particular, I have had regard to s 5C(a): the burden of taking precautions to avoid a risk of harm includes the burden of taking precautions to avoid similar risks of harm for which the person is responsible. I am not entirely sure whether Mr Gross's ultimate submission was that the boards had to be completely covered because a single joist was not braced with a noggin on each side or whether they had to be covered because it was dangerous to leave them uncovered. However, if it be the latter, then s 5C(a) is relevant since it would have required the first defendant to cover all of the uncovered joists throughout the first floor of the property. Since Mrs Rigby did not agree to the first defendant's suggestion that there be an under-layer of plywood, he would have had to do it at his own expense and contrary to her instructions.
112Section 5C(b) is also relevant, in that it provides that the fact that a risk of harm could have been avoided by doing something in a different way does not of itself give rise to or affect liability for the way in which the thing was done. That covering the floor or putting up a barricade as distinct from a cordon are other precautions that could be taken to prevent a person from gaining access to the kitchen area does not mean that the first defendant is liable to the plaintiff for not taking such precautions if the precautions he actually took were reasonable, as I have found them to be.
113It follows that there will be judgment for the first defendant on the plaintiff's claim.


The case against Mr Tilden, the second defendant
114While not a party to the building contract, Mr Tilden was referred to in it in the following two notes. Note 4 to cl 1 of the contract, which incorporated General Conditions of Contract, provided:
""The contractor acknowledges and agrees that John Tilden ('the Supervisor') may act as the owner's supervisor of the works and the contractor will accept and act upon instructions issued by either the Supervisor or the owner in writing.""
115Note 3 to cl 11 (Payment Agreement) provided for the owner's obligation to pay trade subcontractors and relevantly provided:
""The owner will make payment to the trade subcontractor within 7 days of John Tilden certifying the invoice for payment.""
116Mr Tilden played various roles in connection with the site. He was a draftsman who did some drawings for the renovation and advised Mrs Rigby about the appropriateness of sums claimed in invoices that were submitted by the builder and various constructors. His letterhead describes him, amongst other things, as ""project manager"" and I find that he performed some of the tasks associated with that description.
117Although the plaintiff's case against the second defendant was only faintly pressed, his claim was not entirely abandoned. Indeed, at times, the plaintiff sought to establish matters which were in Mr Tilden's favour. 
118I consider that both Mr Tilden and Mrs Rigby sought to minimise his role with respect to the site. He insisted that he was just a ""draftsman"" whereas Mrs Rigby steadfastly maintained that he was ""clerk of works"", as if his only role had been to vet invoices. Although this understatement does not reflect particularly well on the credibility of either, it does not affect the plaintiff's case against Mr Tilden in any substantial way because of the evidence that established what Mr Tilden actually did, as distinct from what his title was.
119Mr Tilden arranged for the third defendant to construct the false chimney. His reasons for not engaging RMC, which had formerly worked on the site, appear to be that he was concerned about the timetable and he did not consider that he could wait for RMC to become available to perform the work. He was, accordingly, responsible for engaging the third defendant to perform the work on the chimney. He consulted with Mrs Rigby who approved of and authorised the engagement.
120Although Mr Tilden said that Mr Rudd did not tell him that he would be away on holidays, Mr Tilden learned of Mr Rudd's absence from Mrs Rigby. When Mr Tilden retained the third defendant without reference to Mr Rudd he appreciated that Mr Rudd was away and he was in charge during this period. 
121The only ""site induction"" which Mr Tilden performed was the inspection with Mr McWilliams on 9 February 2004.  It is difficult to see what a more comprehensive site induction could relevantly have added to what was made obvious by the presence of hazard tape and a plywood barricade at the entrance to the kitchen area. Therefore even if Mr Tilden did not specifically tell the third defendant not to go into the kitchen area I do not consider that his failure to do so had any relevant causal effect, since if a person is not dissuaded by hazard tape from entering a particular area, that person is unlikely to be dissuaded by an oral warning or prohibition.
122Aside from this omission, Mr Tilden's only causal responsibility appears to be to have been that, but for his engagement of the third defendant, the plaintiff would not have been on site and would therefore not have been injured. This passes the ""but for"" test of causation but this is not always sufficient for legal responsibility: Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation Limited (1987) 9 NSWLR 310 at 335-336, per Mahoney JA and at 349-358, per McHugh JA; March v Stramare (1991) [1991] HCA 12; 171 CLR 506.  I find it is not sufficient in the instant case.
123Accordingly there will be judgment for the second defendant on the plaintiff's claim.
The case against DMW Carpentry, the third defendant
The pleadings
124It was common ground between the plaintiff and the third defendant that the plaintiff was, at least, a deemed worker under Sch 1, cl 2 of the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998. On the first day of the hearing the plaintiff applied for leave to amend the statement of claim to delete allegations that he was an employee of the third defendant and to substitute an allegation that he was at all material times performing carpentry work on the premises in his capacity as an independent contractor to the third defendant. Because to allow the amendment would have led to an adjournment of the proceedings I did not permit the plaintiff to delete paragraph 14C of the Third Amended Statement of Claim in which he alleged in part that:
""The Plaintiff...  was performing carpentry work on the premises under a contract which, in terms of Schedule 1, clause 2 of the of the Workplace Injury Management & Workers Compensation Act 1998 (NSW) was a contract made by the third defendant with the plaintiff as contractor.""
125On the fourth day of the hearing, the plaintiff made the following concession:
""The plaintiff concedes he was, at the time of the accident, a deemed worker under the Workers Compensation Act of the third defendant as per paragraph 14C of the Third Amended Statement of Claim and that in the event that the plaintiff recovers damages, s 151Z of the Workers Compensation Act will operate in relation to any recovery rights of the Workers Compensation insurer.""
126On the final day of the hearing, the first defendant made submissions in support of his cross-claim against the third defendant that the plaintiff was an employee of the third defendant and that the third defendant accordingly owed him a non-delegable duty of care to take reasonable steps to ensure a safe system of work. The first defendant submitted that the plaintiff was in the kitchen area as a result of the third defendant's failure to discharge his duty of care and that accordingly the third defendant was liable to the plaintiff. These submissions require a detailed consideration of all the evidence in the case, and in particular the physical evidence, which will be set out further below.
127Following the conclusion of the first defendant's submissions, immediately before the luncheon adjournment on the fifth and final day of the hearing, the plaintiff applied for leave to amend the statement of claim to reinstate the allegation that he was an employee of the third defendant. Leave was granted to insert the following paragraph, 14D, into the statement of claim (which became the Fourth Amended Statement of Claim):
""Alternatively, the Third Defendant at all material times employed the Plaintiff.""
128I allowed the amendment because the question whether the plaintiff was an employee was always an issue in the case since, as set out above, the first defendant alleged in his cross-claim against the third defendant that the plaintiff was an employee of the third defendant. I considered that it was a necessary amendment for the purposes of determining the real questions raised by the proceedings within the meaning of s 64(2) of the Civil Procedure Act 2005.
129Generally speaking, the duties owed by employers to employees are higher than those owed to independent contractors (who may be deemed workers under the Sch 1, cl 2 of the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998). There was, accordingly, at least a possibility that the plaintiff might fail against the third defendant because he did not allege that he was employed and yet the first defendant's cross-claim against the third defendant would be determined on the basis that the plaintiff was employed by the third defendant. This would have been highly undesirable. Although the plaintiff's counsel appear to have changed their minds more than once in the course of these proceedings as to the way they wish to chart the plaintiff's course, I do not consider that the plaintiff ought be prejudiced by their conduct of his case, which required difficult forensic decisions to be made.
130The third defendant could not point to any particular prejudice arising from the amendment, but it was submitted on his behalf that the plaintiff was bound by his counsel's conduct of the case and that the decision to abandon the employment allegation on the first day was a deliberate forensic one, to which he should be held. I considered this matter to be insufficient to outweigh the other matters to which I have referred above. 
131In my view the dictates of justice, as referred to in s 58 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 were, on balance, in favour of allowing the amendment, and accordingly I allowed it.
The status of the plaintiff: employee or independent contractor?
132The duty and standard of care owed by the third defendant to the plaintiff depends in part on whether the plaintiff was an employee of the third defendant. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine this question at the outset.
133The plaintiff put, only as an alternative, that he was an employee of the third defendant. However, the first defendant put it as his primary submission on his cross-claim against the third defendant. 
134The plaintiff's evidence is that he was paid at an hourly rate of about $28.50 and that his wages were paid by the third defendant into his personal bank account without tax having been deducted.  As referred to above, he registered a business name, A1 Carpentry, and obtained an ABN when he arrived in Australia. Had he not already done so, the third defendant would have required him to do so. He worked exclusively for the third defendant from the time of his arrival in Australia. The work that he did permitted the third defendant to fulfil his contractual responsibilities to third parties, such as to Mrs Rigby, through Mr Tilden, in the instant case. The plaintiff did not get any jobs on his own account; it was the third defendant which invariably obtained the jobs on which the plaintiff worked. He worked about 40 hours a week and started at 7.00 am and finished at about 3.30 pm. If he worked later, he was not paid for extra time.
135He supplied such of his own tools as were contained in a carpentry bag and a nail bag, both of which could be, and generally were, looped through his belt and carried with him as he performed his duties. On the day of the accident the contents of these bags included a claw hammer, a pen, numerous screws and nails, a 100 millimetre steel hinge, a retractable measuring tape, a retractable Stanley knife and a green carpenter's pencil. The other tools, such a power tools including angle-grinders, drills and skill saws, and equipment, such as a sawhorse and trestles, were supplied by the third defendant.
136The extent to which the third defendant controlled the plaintiff is relevant but not determinative, since the whole of the relationship must be considered: Hollis v Vabu Pty Limited [2001] HCA 44; 207 CLR 21. I find that the third defendant controlled the work that would be done by the plaintiff, when it would be done and where it would be done. He supervised the plaintiff. 
137Although the plaintiff did not recall wearing a uniform, I accept the evidence of Mr McWilliams that the plaintiff wore the third defendant's uniform when he was working. The third defendant submitted that I should find that the plaintiff was more likely to have been wearing a T-shirt with a kangaroo or an aboriginal motif than one with the third defendant's crest. I do not consider that the state of the evidence permits me to make this finding. In particular the third defendant was not asked whether he took his T-shirt off and left it in the basement after he had gone there to tend to the plaintiff.  Nor was Mr Bielik asked whether any of the T-shirts were his. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the plaintiff was wearing both bloodied T-shirts at the time of his fall: the kangaroo T-shirt as an undershirt and the DMW polo shirt over the top.
138I find that, having regard to all of the matters referred to above, the plaintiff was employed by the third defendant.
139However, even had I found that the plaintiff was not, strictly speaking, an employee, the distinction may not be material. The distinguishing feature of the employment relationship is that the employer's duty of care is non-delegable. 
140In the instant case, there was no delegation of any duty owed by the third defendant. Apart from Mr McWilliams' temporary absence for a short period on the morning of the accident, he was present on the site with the plaintiff at all times while they were working. At no time did the third defendant arrange for anyone else to supervise the plaintiff.
141Even if I am incorrect in finding that the plaintiff was an employee of the third defendant and he was, as the plaintiff submitted, an independent contractor, the duty owed may well be substantially the same. In Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Limited [1986] HCA 1; 160 CLR 16, Mason J said at 31:
""The interdependence of the activities carried out in the forest, the need for co-ordination by Brodribb of those activities and the distinct risk of personal injury to those engaged in the operations, called for the prescription and provision of a safe system by Brodribb. Omission to prescribe and provide such a system would expose the workers to an obvious risk of injury. Although the obligation to provide a safe system of work has been regarded as one attaching to an employer, there is no reason why it should be so confined. If an entrepreneur engages independent contractors to do work which might as readily be done by employees in circumstances where there is a risk to them of injury arising from the nature of the work and where there is a need for him to give directions as to when and where the work is to be done and to co-ordinate the various activities, he has an obligation to prescribe a safe system of work. The fact that they are not employees, or that he does not retain a right to control them in the manner in which they carry out their work, should not affect the existence of an obligation to prescribe a safe system. Brodribb's ability to prescribe such a system was not affected by its inability to direct the contractors as to how they should operate their machines.""
142There was a need for the third defendant to give directions to the plaintiff and co-ordinate his work with the plaintiff's own. The third defendant had the ability not only to prescribe a safe system, but also to direct the plaintiff to comply with it. The control that the third defendant had, and exercised, in directing the plaintiff how to do the job was not less if it be found, contrary to my finding above, that the plaintiff is an independent contractor.
143I consider that, irrespective of whether the plaintiff was an employee or independent contractor, the duty owed to him by the third defendant was akin to that which would have been owed had he been an employee, namely a duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing him to the risk of injury: Rockdale Beef Pty Limited v Carey [2003] NSWCA 132 at [94], per Ipp JA (Mason P and McColl JA agreeing).
Why the plaintiff was in the kitchen area
The plaintiff's case: that it did not matter why he was in the kitchen
144The plaintiff submitted that it did not matter why the plaintiff was in the kitchen area and, indeed, what he was doing there. However Mr Cavanagh SC, on behalf of the first defendant, made detailed submissions designed to persuade me that the reason the plaintiff was in the kitchen area was because he was undertaking work for the third defendant there and that, accordingly, the third defendant was negligent and liable to the plaintiff.
145Because, as I have found, the third defendant controlled the plaintiff in his carpentry work, there are two possibilities: either the plaintiff was in the kitchen area because of the work he was required to do for the third defendant or he was there for an extraneous reason.
The first defendant's case: the plaintiff was in the kitchen area with the express or implied permission or consent of the third defendant
146The first defendant submitted that I should find that the plaintiff was in the kitchen area at the behest of, or for the benefit of, the third defendant or that the third defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care to take reasonable steps to ensure that he did not go into the kitchen area. 
147The first defendant made the following circumstantial case to establish that the kitchen area had been used as a work site by the plaintiff, and probably the third defendant, with the express or implied permission or consent of the third defendant. It followed that the third defendant was in breach of his duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that the plaintiff did not enter the kitchen area.
148The primary facts that comprise the circumstantial case are:
(1)RMC last performed work in the kitchen area on about 5 January 2004.
(2)Apart from Mr Bielik, who was working in the garden, the only persons working on the site from the time Mr Rudd left on 6 February 2004 until the accident were the third defendant and the plaintiff.
(3)When Mr Rudd left the site on 6 February 2004, there were no walking planks or boards across the joists in the kitchen area and the broom and the shovel were not there.
(4)When Mr Rudd left the site on 6 February 2004, there was no blue power cord looped across a joist in the kitchen area.
(5)There was a cordon constructed of hazard tape and plywood across the entrance to the kitchen area at 7.30 am on 12 February 2004 which deterred or prevented Mrs Rigby, Mr Hardwick and Mr Bloodworth from entering the kitchen area. 
(6)The cordon had been removed by the middle of the day, when the first WorkCover inspector arrived and closed the site.
(7)On 12 February 2004 there were walking planks and boards across some of the joists in the kitchen area.
(8)On 12 February 2004 there was a blue power cord looped across a joist in the kitchen area which was live, in that it had power ready to be used, although the power was not flowing, since no tool was attached to it.
(9)Neither the owner nor Mr Tilden played any part in putting the walking planks in the kitchen area or using the blue power cord there. 
(10)As at 12 February 2004, the walking planks and boards had been recently swept.
(11)Each blueboard was 2.4 x 1.2 metres and weighed between 35 and 40 kilograms.
(12)There were 3-4 blueboards outside the residence, which needed to be cut into halves or quarters.
149The findings of credibility for which the first defendant contends are:
(1)Mr McWilliams' evidence including his evidence that he used red and yellow but not blue power cords ought not be accepted. 
(2)When Mr McWilliams said in a statement to WorkCover dated 22 March 2004 that the plaintiff carried the blueboards up to the first level, I should infer that the blueboards had not already been cut to size.
(3)Mr Rudd's evidence that the walking planks and boards and the broom and shovel that were in the kitchen area at the time of the WorkCover inspection were not there when he left the site on 6 February 2004 ought be accepted.
150The inferences for which the first defendant contends are:
(1)The cordon was not removed by any of the ambulance or police officers who attended the scene in answer to the Triple-0 calls or Mrs Rigby, Mt Tilden or Mr Bielik.
(2)The cordon was removed either by the plaintiff or the third defendant so as to access the kitchen area to perform carpentry work.
151The first defendant also sought to establish that the ground was wet at the relevant time, which may have inclined the third defendant and the plaintiff to work inside instead of out in the open on ground which could have been muddy. Mr Cavanagh relied on a Daily Rainfall report of the Bureau of Meteorology which showed that in the 24 hours before 9.00 am on 12 February 2004, 21.4 millimetres of rain fell at the Royal Sydney Golf Club at Rose Bay.
152The first defendant said that I should not draw any inference against him for not calling Mr Mori. Although Mr Rudd contracted with RMC, they could not be said to be ""in the same camp"" for the purposes of a Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8; 101 CLR 298 inference. I accept this submission.
The third defendant's credibility
153The first defendant accepted that if I accept the evidence of Mr McWilliams, I cannot find that the circumstantial case that the plaintiff was in the kitchen area with the express or implied permission of the third defendant to have been made out.
154The first defendant submitted for the following several reasons that I should not accept Mr McWilliams as a witness of truth.
155First, the first defendant submitted that Mr McWilliams was prepared to say to WorkCover when he was interviewed on 22 March 2004 when asked what, in his opinion, would have prevented the accident from occurring:
""The floor should have been completed with a covering or cordoned off so that people can't enter the area.""
156The first defendant submitted that this answer was given when Mr McWilliams well knew that there had been hazard tape and plywood barring the entrance to the kitchen when he was working at the site and that he gave a misleading answer because he wanted to deflect attention from his own responsibility.
157Secondly, the first defendant relied on several answers given by Mr McWilliams in the witness box to the effect that he could not recall matters to which he deposed without qualification in his statement made on 3 March 2012.
158Thirdly, the first defendant was critical of Mr McWilliams' lack of recollection of the way the work had been performed. Mr McWilliams' recollection did not permit him to recall whether he erected trestles on the ground to cut the timber and the blueboards. He said, however, that it was his usual practice to do so. He also said that had he not used trestles, he would have used a sawhorse. He said that he would not have cut the timber or the blueboards on the ground itself. Nor would he have carried the timber or the blueboards inside to cut them. His evidence was that cutting blueboards creates dust and it is always preferable to cut them outside. He was sure that he would have cut the timber outside near where it was stacked.
159The third defendant submitted that it was not open to the first defendant to submit that Mr McWilliams was not telling the truth because it was not sufficiently put to him.
160I substantially accept Mr McWilliams' evidence. I do not consider Mr McWilliams' lack of precise recollection adversely affects his credibility. My impression was that he did not want to overstate what he was able to remember. Although his answer to WorkCover as to how the accident could have been avoided referred to above was anomalous given that he agreed that there was a cordon across the entrance to the kitchen area, I did not form the impression that he was other than forthcoming in describing the cordon in his evidence in chief. Furthermore, his evidence was not particularly self-serving. He did not, for example, recall whether he had had any discussion with the plaintiff about not going into the kitchen area arising from having been with him when they saw the hazard tape. He also did not recall the location of the power board that was used on 11 and 12 February 2004, although it was very much in his interests to say that he used a powerboard that was outside the premises.
161Importantly, I accept his evidence that he did not put the plywood walking plank or sheets in the kitchen area and that neither he, nor the plaintiff to his knowledge, entered the kitchen area prior to his departure on the morning of 12 February 2004.
162I also accept Mr McWilliams' evidence that the reason he asked people he engaged to do carpentry work to have their own ABNs was not in order to prevent their being regarded as his employees.
The third defendant's submissions in response to the first defendant's case
163The third defendant submitted that the fundamental premise of Mr Cavanagh's circumstantial case, that there was no one else working on the site from when Mr Rudd left on 6 February 2004, could not be made out. He pointed to Mr Rudd's diary entry for that day which referred to ""scaffold"". He submitted that I ought infer that scaffolders use power tools and that since there was scaffolding outside the kitchen window, I could infer that there was at least a possibility that the power cord and the dust created was used by the scaffolders. 
164Although I am prepared to accept the submission that scaffolders were on the site on Friday 6 February 2004, I do not consider that I ought accept the submission that they were using power tools since it was not put to Mr Rudd and it may well be that he would have had an answer to it (Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R (HL) 67). Furthermore I would not infer, in the absence of evidence, that scaffolders use power tools.
165The third defendant relied on Mr Rudd's evidence that there were bricklayers on site on 6 February 2004 and that they were using power.
166The third defendant submitted that I ought not infer from the WorkCover inspectors report that the boards in the kitchen area had been swept within any particular period. Rather, all I could infer was that there had not been any dusty work performed in that area since the boards had last been swept.
167The third defendant also submitted that the appearance of the kitchen area, the walking planks, the plywood boards and the blue power cord, were consistent with Mr Mori leaving and expecting to be able to return shortly to resume work on the kitchen floor.
168The third defendant submitted that I ought not accept Mr Rudd's evidence that when he left the site on 6 February 2004 neither the boards, the walking plank, the power cord, the broom nor the shovel was in the kitchen area. The third defendant relied on Mr Rudd's admission that the first time he had been asked to recall the appearance of the kitchen area was more than eight years after the accident, on 28 March 2012, the morning he gave oral evidence in these proceedings. The third defendant submitted that the appearance of the kitchen area was, at that time, a matter of no consequence to Mr Rudd and therefore it is highly unlikely that he would have taken any particular note of it. The third defendant relied on the circumstances that Mr Rudd spent a total of one and a half hours on the job that day, he was about to go away on a holiday to Canada and the work that needed to be done on the site while he was away was to be done outside and did not involve the kitchen area at all. At the conclusion of the cross-examination by the third defendant, Mr Rudd adhered to his evidence, about these items not being in the kitchen area and said:
""I'm pretty sure they weren't there.""
169As to the rainfall records, the third defendant submitted that there was no evidence as to the distance between the rain collector at Rose Bay and the site. Furthermore it submitted that rain in Sydney is notoriously localised. He drew my attention to the photographs taken by the WorkCover inspector on 12 February 2004 which depicted a bright, sunny day with no obvious dampness evidence on the ground. The third defendant submitted that I should accept Mr McWilliams' evidence that it was a ""beautiful day"".
170The third defendant also relied on Mr McWilliams' evidence that one would not, if one had the choice, cut blueboard inside since it creates toxic and unpleasant dust. Furthermore he submitted that it made no sense to suppose that tradesmen would carry blueboard sheets which weighed 35-40 kilograms inside to cut them into smaller (and therefore lighter) pieces. The third defendant submitted that I should accept Mr McWilliams' evidence that he did not go into the kitchen area, that the plaintiff, to his knowledge, did not go in until the accident occurred (when Mr McWilliams was away) and that the kitchen area was neither a convenient place for the work to be done or a convenient thoroughfare.
171The third defendant placed emphasis on Mr Rudd's evidence that there was an alternative temporary power source in the backyard on the Wentworth Avenue side, which was on the same level as the kitchen area. Although Mr McWilliams could not recall what power source he used, or whether there was a power source available in the backyard near where the timber and the blueboards were stored, he agreed that a power source outside the kitchen window would have been the closest and therefore the most convenient.
172The third defendant submitted that if there was any inference to be drawn against any party by reason of Mr Mori's not having been called to give evidence I should draw the inference against the first defendant.
Findings on the why the plaintiff was in the kitchen area
173I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities of any of the following matters:
(1) That the third defendant removed the plywood or hazard tape from the entrance to the kitchen area;
(2) That the third defendant directed the plaintiff to use the power source in the basement under the kitchen area, or acquiesced in his so doing;
(3) That the blue power cord was the third defendant's, as distinct from RMC's;
(4) That there was any impediment to the plaintiff's using the power source that was outside the residence, near where the blueboard and timber was stacked;
(5) That the plaintiff actually used the blue power cord which was powered from the basement or went into the kitchen area to investigate an alternative power source;
(6) When the boards in the kitchen area had been swept, and by whom;
(7) When the noggin fell to the basement and whether this was the sound of timber falling that Mr Bielik recalled;
(8) That there was any reason, associated with the construction of the chimney, being the work which he was to perform for the third defendant, for the plaintiff's being in the kitchen area;
(9) When and by whom the plywood barrier and hazard tape were removed.
174The removal of the hazard tape and the plywood from the opening to the kitchen area is a very significant integer in the first defendant's circumstantial case. He submitted that it ""defies belief"" that such items could have been removed by ambulance or police. I do not accept this submission. When the police and ambulance officers attended the site, I infer that the most significant matter was the plaintiff's life and the concern that he might die if not brought to hospital quickly. The WorkCover report recorded:
""APPARENTLY IP [injured person] IS TRAPPED.""
175Mr Bielik's evidence of the post-accident scene was:
""Within a few minutes the whole mayhem broke loose. There were five or six police cars, construction rescue, two ambulances...""
176Although there is no suggestion that the plaintiff was actually evacuated through the ground floor, it may well have been something that was considered, if not by police or ambulance officers, then possibly by the construction rescue workers to whom Mr Bielik refers. Although Mr Bielik regarded the entranceway from the garden to the basement as being ""pretty open"", this would not necessarily have been apparent to persons who did not know the site as well as he did and it may not have been ""pretty open"" to a number of people carrying a stretcher. Although I have reservations about the reliability of Mr Bielik's evidence having regard to the trauma he suffered, I am inclined to accept his estimate as broadly accurate that between six and eight people were required to carry the plaintiff out to the ambulance because he was a ""big guy"". It appears that the plaintiff had also had a seizure and needed to be restrained, which may also account for the number of people required to move him.
177I am not satisfied that the possibility that one of the persons who came to the site to help rescue the plaintiff removed the plywood and the hazard tape has been excluded on the balance of probabilities.
178Although I am prepared to infer that, as a matter of general practice, police and ambulance officers do not interfere with a site, particularly when they have grounds to expect, as occurred here, that WorkCover will investigate it, I do not consider it to be fanciful or far-fetched that one such officer, rescue worker or indeed a well-meaning neighbour or passer-by removed the tape and the board in order to see if there was a better means of access than through the cellar which was the path taken by Mr Bielik to get to the plaintiff, or through the ground floor and down the stairs to the dining room, which was the route taken by Mr McWilliams, both of whom were familiar with the site. Senior Inspector Macready gave evidence that neither he nor Senior Inspector Waterhouse made any enquiries of the police or other emergency services whether they had altered the premises.
179Senior Inspector Macready said that the detailed inspection was restricted to the kitchen area and the laundry area. If the hazard tape and plywood had been removed or cast aside, it would be understandable if the WorkCover inspectors either did not notice it (because it was not in the area the subject of their detailed inspection) or did not link its presence on the site with the accident and their investigation and made no mention of it in their report. 
180Although it is not fatal to the first defendant's circumstantial case against the third defendant, I am influenced by the fact that there were no blueboards in the kitchen area or any tools that the plaintiff might have been using had he gone into that area to work. Indeed there is no sign in the kitchen area of what the plaintiff was doing while he was there. The positions of the shovel and the broom as depicted in the photographs are inconsistent with his having used them immediately prior to his fall, or indeed at any time. I consider that it is more probable that the nail bag and carpenter's bag ended up on the floor of the basement because the ambulance officers removed the plaintiff's clothing and belt in order to treat him, rather than because they fell and he tried to retrieve them, or because he had removed them both to perform a particular task without the encumbrance that they imposed.
181The fact that there is no sign of activity in the kitchen area which unequivocally implicates the third defendant is all the more important since Mr McWilliams and the plaintiff had already done a full day's work on the site before the day of the accident. They had cut timber and done most of the formwork for the chimney on that first day. That there was no sign of their being in the kitchen corroborates Mr Rudd's evidence that there was a power source outside near where the material was stacked which they could have used, and Mr McWilliams' evidence that they did use that power source.
182I accept the third defendants's submission that that there was, according to Mr Rudd's evidence an available power source outside near where the blueboards and timber had been stacked and that Mr McWilliams and the plaintiff used it and did not have to have recourse to the power source in the basement below the kitchen area.
183I accept that Mr McWilliams used either trestles or a sawhorse to cut the timber and that this occurred outside. I am not satisfied that they were prevented from performing these tasks outside by inclement weather.
184As I have said above, I accept the first defendant's submissions that it is not appropriate to draw any Jones v Dunkel inference against Mr Rudd by reason of the fact that Mr Mori was not called. Mr Rudd's evidence was that each trade would have their own power cords and bring them to the site. However, Mr Mori may have been able to shed light on the presence of the blue power cord, the broom and the shovel in the kitchen area. In particular he might have been able to give evidence as to whether the blue power cord was one that he used at that time. His absence does not lead to an inference either way but there are, by reason of his absence, matters about which I have no evidence.
185Since Mr Mori was not called, I am left with the evidence of Mr Rudd that these items were not in the kitchen area on 6 February 2004. Although I do not consider Mr Rudd to be untruthful, I do not consider his evidence to be reliable in this respect. The kitchen area was to be constructed, at least in so far as its floor was concerned, by RMC. The time at which RMC was to return to the site was unknown and depended on a decision about the location of the air-conditioning. Mr Rudd did not recall who he asked to put up a plywood bar and hazard tape across the entrance to the kitchen premises, but he did not suggest that he did either of these things himself. Had he done them himself, his evidence as to the state of the kitchen area on 6 February 2004 might have been more reliable since he would have had the opportunity to make such observations on the day in a more consistent fashion. I do not accept his evidence as to the state of the kitchen area on 6 February 2004.
186Mr Rudd's evidence as to the state of the kitchen area on his last day on the site before his holiday is crucial to the first defendant's circumstantial case against the third defendant. Because I do not accept his evidence and because I am not satisfied of the matters listed above, I am unable to accept the first defendant's circumstantial case.
187It follows that the plaintiff was in the kitchen for a reason which has not been shown to be associated with his employment, aside from the fact that but for his employment he would not have been on the site at all. I am not satisfied that the third defendant was in any way implicated in the removal of the plywood sign and the hazard tape. In my view there is no proper basis for an inference that these were removed prior to the plaintiff's decision to go into the kitchen.
188There was no reason for the plaintiff to be in the kitchen area at all to perform his work. There was a power source outside which had been, and could be, used to cut the timber and the blueboard. There were stairs which could be used to carry the timber and the blueboard to the first floor of the building when the ground floor construction had been completed.
189The difficulty in formulating any breach of a duty of care that the third defendant owed to the plaintiff is that I cannot, for reasons already given, determine why the plaintiff was in the kitchen area or what caused him to fall. 
190The plaintiff includes in his particulars res ipsa loquitur. In my view, the instant case is not amenable to that doctrine since what occurred and why it occurred is a matter of speculation: Shellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Limited [2000] HCA 18; 200 CLR 121. Some hypotheses which might be envisaged would involve negligence (such as had the third defendant directed the plaintiff to enter the kitchen area to gain access to the power board in the basement below), but others would not (if the plaintiff chose on his own account to disregard the hazard tape and barricade and take advantage of Mr McWilliams' absence to enter the kitchen area to inspect the first floor because he was curious).
191Although the duties on employers with respect to their employees have been described as onerous and exacting, the relevant duty was to take reasonable care to ensure that the plaintiff had a safe system of work.
192The Act applies and therefore I need to determine, in accordance with s 5B, what a person in the third defendant's position would have done to take precautions against the relevant risk of harm, being the possibility that the plaintiff would enter the working area. Because the first defendant had caused hazard tape and plywood to be installed across the kitchen entrance, the third defendant did not, in my view, need to do any more as part of ensuring a safe system of work, in circumstances where, as I have found, the plaintiff had no need to go into the kitchen area. Whether the third defendant expressly prohibited him from going into the kitchen area is not to the point, since in my view, the sign was adequate to indicate that entry was forbidden.
193The plaintiff has not discharged his onus of proving that the third defendant was negligent, or that any negligent act caused him to fall. 
194For the foregoing reasons there must be judgment for the third defendant on the plaintiff's claim.






Conclusion
Contributory negligence
195The plaintiff submitted that there should be no deduction for contributory negligence.  The first and third defendants submitted that there needed to be a significant discount for contributory negligence if any of the defendants were liable. It is well established that in employment relationships, there is usually a lesser allowance for contributory negligence because of the relationship: see Thompson v Woolworth's (Queensland) Pty Limited [2005] HCA 19; 221 CLR 234 at 247-248; and Bankstown Foundry Pty Limited v Braistina [1986] HCA 20; 160 CLR 301 at 310.
196Because of the significant uncertainties surrounding the cause and mechanics of the plaintiff's fall it is not possible to make a realistic assessment of the extent to which, if at all, the plaintiff contributed to his own injuries. All that can be said with confidence is that a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would not have gone into the kitchen area.
197Further, in light of my findings on liability, it is unnecessary to determine an appropriate deduction for contributory negligence.
Cross-claims
198In light of my findings it is unnecessary to determine the cross-claims, which are accordingly each dismissed.






Orders
199The orders are:
(1)Judgment for the defendants on the plaintiff's claim.
(2)Dismiss all cross-claims.
(3)Order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs of the proceedings, including of the cross-claims.

		12 April 2012",2012-04-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759045,Environment Protection Authority v Truegain Pty Ltd [No 3] [2012] NSWLEC 78,"Judgment

1On 3 June 2011 the prosecutor filed a summons alleging that the defendant committed an offence against s 64(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 in that it was the holder of a licence a condition of which was contravened by a person.

2The defendant seeks an order that the prosecutor pay its costs of certain interlocutory proceedings, namely, a notice of motion (filed on 20 February 2012) for further particulars, amended on 1 March 2012 for an order that the charge be dismissed or otherwise stayed on the basis that it was duplicitous; and the costs of the hearing of the latter motion on 19 and 20 March 2012, together with the hearing of this application for costs on 21 March 2012.

3There are two questions for determination:

(1) is an order for costs justified in the circumstances; and if so - 

(2) does the Court have jurisdiction to make an order for costs at this stage of the proceedings, that is, before the end of the proceedings.

Is an order for costs justified in the circumstances?

4The defendant submits that it is just and reasonable that the prosecutor pay its costs because of the manner of the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, prompting the need for the defendant to bring its notices of motion (in which it has been substantially successful).

5In order to determine the question it is necessary to have regard to the following chronology.





13 June 2011:

Summons served on the defendant 







29 July 2011:

Summons returnable. The Court made the following directions:
(1) Prosecutor to file and serve evidence on liability by 19 August 2011 and
(2) the matter re-listed on 26 August 2011 (not, as Ms P Lenehan, the prosecutor's in-house solicitor, asserts in her affidavit, 16 September 2011.)







26 August 2011:

Not all of prosecutor's evidence served - matter stood over to 16 September 2011







7 September 2011:

Mr C Bilinsky, the defendant's solicitor, sent a letter to Ms Lenehan acknowledging receipt of the affidavit of Alan England, noting the prosecutor's intentions to file further affidavits and enquiring when the affidavit of Dr Wayne Davies may be expected.







13 September 2011:

Mr Bilinsky had a telephone conversation with Ms Lenehan during which the following was said:
Bilinsky: ""We're having difficulty understanding what your case is. We will have to seek further and better particulars.""
Lenehan: ""I suggest that you might wait to get Dr Davies' affidavit and that might clear up a lot of the matters.""







13 September 2011:

Ms Lenehan sent by email to Mr Bilinsky proposed Short Minutes of Orders vacating the mention on 16 September and the prosecutor to file and serve the affidavit of Dr Davies by 21 September 2011.







15 September 2011:

The Court made orders by consent:
(1) that the prosecutor file and serve the affidavit of Dr W Davies by 21 September 2011, and
(2) matter adjourned to 30 September 2011.







30 September 2011:

Mr Bilinsky informed the Court that the defendant wanted further particulars of the prosecution case. Mr Bilinsky sought an order for particulars, which was refused. The Court re-listed the matter for 7 October 2011.







7 October 2011:

The defendant's counsel, Mr J Horowitz, again sought an order that the prosecutor provide particulars of the charge. Ms Lenehan advised the Court that she did not consent to the provision of further particulars. The Court declined to make the order. The Court then ordered, by consent, that the prosecutor serve a draft statement of agreed facts by 21 November 2011, and the defendant to respond to that draft by 21 December 2011.
The matter was set down for hearing for two weeks commencing on 19 March 2012.







7 October 2011:

The defendant's counsel discussed with Ms Lenehan the possibility of entering a guilty plea.







13 October 2011:

Mr Bilinsky sent a letter to Ms Lenehan asking for oil samples collected by the prosecutor from in and around the defendant's premises to be made available, for an indication of the range of penalty that would be sought, and the amount of the prosecutor's costs and anticipated costs.







8 November 2011:

Having read the evidence served by the prosecutor, including the affidavit of Dr Davies, Mr Bilinsky was still unable to properly understand the prosecutor's case and sent a letter to Ms Lenehan seeking further and better particulars.







6 December 2011:

Mr Bilinsky sent a letter to Ms Lenehan noting that Pepper J had ordered the prosecutor to serve a draft statement of agreed facts by 21 November 2011, which had still not been received, that it was not possible to respond to the draft by 21 December 2011, and asking for an indication when it may be expected.







6 December 2011

Mr Bilinsky sent a further letter to Mr Lenehan, referring to the request for further and better particulars of 8 November 2011 and asking for the particulars to be provided as soon as possible.







7 December 2011:

Ms Lenhan sent an email to Mr Bilinsky stating that she was preparing a response (to each letter of 6 December 2011), and a draft statement of facts would be completed shortly and that she would have a response to him by the following week.







14 December 2011:

At 2.22pm Mr Bilinsky emailed a letter to Ms Lenehan voicing concern that the prosecutor had not complied with the timetable and noting that it was impossible for the defendant to comply with the timetable.







14 December 2011:

At 6.26 pm the prosecutor emailed to Mr Bilinsky a draft statement of agreed facts comprising 254 paragraphs, and stated that the requested particulars had been covered in that draft.







14 December 2011:

At 7.05 pm Ms Lenehan sent an email to Mr Bilinsky attaching a new set of orders and asking him to advise ""before 11 am tomorrow"" if the date for his response to the draft statement of facts by 10 February 2012 is ample.







16 December 2011:

The Court made orders by consent amending the timetable. Mr Bilinsky had not had an opportunity to read the draft statement of agreed facts by then and consented to the orders on the assumption that it answered the defendant's request for particulars, as stated by Ms Lenehan in her first email of 14 December 2011.







19 December 2011:

Mr Lenehan replied to Mr Bilinsky's letter of 13 October 2011.







7 February 2012:

Having read the draft statement of agreed facts and sought advice from counsel, Mr Bilinsky emailed a letter to Ms Lenehan stating that the particulars previously requested have not been answered in the draft statement, and requesting the particulars sought on 8 November 2011.







14 February 2012:

Ms Lenehan emailed a letter to Mr Bilinsky stating her belief that the particulars of the alleged offence provided in the draft statement of agreed facts provided on 14 December 2011, and in the summons, sufficiently identified the legal nature and the acts that formed the foundation of the alleged offence.







15 February 2012:

Mr Bilinsky emailed a letter to Ms Lenehan stating that, having read the draft statement of facts, they were unable to distil the answers to the particulars, and that they had no alternative but to re-list the matter.







20 February 2012:

The matter was re-listed by Mr Bilinsky so that they could seek an order that the prosecutor provide further and better particulars. This was opposed by the prosecutor. The Court directed the defendant to file a notice of motion returnable on 24 February 2012.







24 February 2012:

The prosecutor indicated to the Court that a response to the defendant's request for further and better particulars would be provided during the course of the morning and the matter was stood down to 2 pm. The prosecutor then provided a seven-page letter of further and better particulars. At 2 pm the defendant advised the Court that the particulars provided were insufficient. The matter was stood over to 28 February to afford the prosecutor an opportunity to provide further particulars.







27 February 2012:

Mr Bilinsky emailed a letter to Ms Lenehan requesting further and better particulars.







28 February 2012:

Ms Lenehan provided Mr Bilinsky with an 11-page letter of further particulars. The defendant's counsel then advised the Court that the defendant wished to amend its notice of motion to seek the dismissal of the charge on the basis that it was duplicitous. The amended Notice of Motion was listed for hearing on 7 March 2012.







7 March 2012:

The defendant's notice of motion was heard.







16 March 2012:

The Court held that the summons as amplified by the particulars was duplicitous and required the prosecutor to elect, prior to the trial, which of the matters it proposed to pursue: Environment Protection Authority v Truegain Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 41.







19 March 2012:

On the first day set down for trial the commencement of the hearing was adjourned to the following day to enable the prosecutor to consider its position following the Court's judgment.







20 March 2012:

The prosecutor elected to proceed upon only two of the particulars it had previously advised, and furnished the defendant with further particulars of the two failures upon which it now relied. The Court held that the two particulars were duplicitous and again required the prosecutor to elect as to which of the two particulars it wishes to pursue: Environment Protection Authority v Truegain Pty Ltd [No 2] [2012] NSWLEC 55.







21 March 2012:

The prosecutor advised the Court that it declined to elect and sought an adjournment in order to appeal against the two interlocutory judgments above under s 5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912.




The defendant also sought an adjournment on the grounds that it still did not know the case which it had to meet, that it had accordingly been unable to settle the statement of agreed facts, that it was unable to prepare a two-week hearing based upon 22 lever-arch folders which the prosecutor had served when much of that material may become irrelevant, that, until the provision of particulars on 28 February 2012, it was unable to properly instruct any experts and that the defendant still did not know on which matters it should obtain an expert opinion.




The Court agreed to vacate the hearing dates for the trial and the defendant applied for an order for costs relating to its notice of motion of 20 February 2012, its costs of the two interlocutory hearings and its costs of this application for costs.

6It can be seen that the prosecutor was consistently in breach of complying with the Court's directions and persistently refused to supply the defendant with the further and better particulars that were sought. This appears from the following facts.

7The summons was served on 13 June 2011. On the return day of the summons a direction was made that the prosecutor file and serve its evidence by 19 August 2011. The prosecutor did not comply with that direction and, on 26 August 2011, the matter was adjourned to 16 September 2011. On 13 September 2011 the defendant's solicitor, Mr Bilinsky, told the prosecutor's solicitor, Ms Lenehan, that they were having difficulty in understanding the prosecutor's case and that they will have to seek further and better particulars. Ms Lenehan suggested that he might wait to get the affidavit of Dr Davies and that might clear up a lot of matters. After receiving and reading Dr Davies' report, Mr Bilinsky still required particulars of the prosecution case and so informed the Court on 30 September. The Court refused to make an order for particulars and listed the matter for plea or mention the following week. On 7 October the defendant's counsel appeared and again sought an order that the prosecutor provide particulars of the charge. The prosecutor did not consent to an order for particulars and the Court declined to make the order. The matter was then set down for hearing on 19 March 2012 and the prosecutor was ordered to serve a draft statement of agreed facts by 21 November 2011. Having read the evidence served by the prosecutor, Mr Bilinsky was still unable to properly understand the prosecutor's case and on 8 November sent a letter to Ms Lenehan seeking further and better particulars. On 6 December Mr Bilinsky again wrote to Ms Lenehan noting that he had not received the draft statement of facts and he had no response to his request for particulars.

8On 14 December 2011 Ms Lenehan emailed to Mr Bilinsky a draft statement of agreed facts comprising 254 paragraphs, and stated that the requested particulars were covered in that draft. On 7 February 2012 Mr Bilinsky wrote to Ms Lenehan stating that the particulars requested on 8 November 2011 had not been answered. On 14 February Ms Lenehan responded stating that the particulars provided in the draft statement of facts and in the summons correctly identified the legal nature and the acts that formed the foundation of the alleged offence.

9On 20 February 2012 the matter was re-listed by Mr Bilinsky so that he could seek an order that the prosecutor provide further and better particulars. This was opposed by the prosecutor. On 24 February 2012 the defendant's formal notice of motion for particulars was listed and then, for the first time, the prosecutor agreed to provide a response to the request for particulars. A seven-page response was provided to the defendant during the day, which the defendant advised the Court as being insufficient.

10On 27 February Mr Bilinsky sent a further letter requesting further and better particulars, which was then answered by an eleven-page response on 28 February. Having been provided with the further and better particulars, the defendant advised the Court on 28 February that it wished to amend its notice of motion so as to seek dismissal of the charge on the ground that it was duplicitous. On 16 March the Court found in favour of the defendant on its amended notice of motion and required the prosecutor to elect as to which of the matters particularised it proposed to pursue. On 20 March the prosecutor advised the Court of two particulars upon which it relied, which the Court again found to be duplicitous.

11It can be seen from this sorry recital of the essential facts that the prosecutor has been persistently in breach of the Court's directions and declined on no less than five occasions to provide the particulars sought by the defendant. It was, frankly, ridiculous to expect the defendant to distill the prosecutor's case from 22 lever-arch files of evidence which had been served and from a draft statement of facts comprising 254 paragraphs (which was itself served by the prosecutor more than three weeks late). The defendant's initial request for particulars was reasonable and, when the particulars were ultimately and somewhat reluctantly supplied, it was necessary for the Court to go to those particulars in order to understand whether the summons as particularised was duplicitous.

12The prosecutor's conduct of the prosecution is deserving of the severest censure and necessitated a large number of otherwise unnecessary pre-trial appearances, culminating in the defendant's notice of motion of 20 February (amended on 1 March) and the subsequent hearing before me.

13I accept the submission of Mr J Horowitz, appearing for the defendant, that the matter should not have proceeded until the particularisation of the acts and omissions said to found the charge was complete. I accept his submission that there was an obligation on the prosecutor to identify those acts and omissions, as explained by the plurality in Kirk v Industrial Relations Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 at [25] - [30]. So, too, in the present case the prosecutor had an obligation to provide particulars at the outset and, at the very latest, when they were specifically requested by the defendant.

14It follows that, in my view, it is just and reasonable for the prosecutor to pay the costs now sought by the defendant. The prosecutor, however, submits that the Court does not have the power to make an order for those costs. It is to that question that I now turn.

Does the Court have jurisdiction to make an interlocutory order for costs?

15The defendant relies upon s 68 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 as the source of the Court's power to make an order for costs. That section relevantly states:

68 Amendments and irregularities

(1) In any proceedings before the Court, the Court shall have power at any stage of the proceeding to order, upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the Court thinks fit, any amendments to be made which, in the opinion of the Court, are necessary in the interests of justice.
...
(4) This section does not apply to proceedings in Class 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the Court's jurisdiction.

16The present proceeding is, of course, in Class 5 of the Court's jurisdiction. The prosecutor submits, however, that s 68 does not apply. The prosecutor says that it does not apply for the following reasons:

(a) The section does not apply to an application to provide particulars. Moreover, the defendant effectively discontinued that motion when the particulars were supplied and it filed an amended notice of motion claiming duplicity.

(b) The section is not a power to awards costs for an application to traverse an indictment pursuant to s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. (In the present case there was, in effect, a traverse of the summons as amplified by the particulars.) Section 68 is not a power to award costs where the Court directs a prosecutor to elect which particulars in the summons it wishes to pursue. No amendment to the summons was ordered.

(c) The section is a provision granting power to order amendments. The qualification ""... upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the Court thinks fit ..."", is ancillary to that power. It does not empower the Court to make on order for costs other than as a consequence of any amendment.

(d) Part 5 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act (ss 245 - 257G) applies to the Class 5 summary jurisdiction of the Court: see s 41, Land and Environment Court Act 1979, s 170(3) Criminal Procedure Act. Sub-section 257C(1) states that the Court may order the prosecutor to pay the costs of an accused person at the end of proceedings. That sub-s states:

A court may at the end of proceedings under this Part order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.

By way of analogy, s 213, which relates to proceedings in a Local Court, is to a similar effect, and in Director of Public Prosecutions v Cakici [2006] NSWSC 454, Johnson J said at [38] that the Local Court did not have the power to order costs in the absence of that provision. Accordingly, since the present proceedings is not at an end, the Court cannot make an order for costs.

(e) In any event, the defendant has not discharged the evidential burden that there must be exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor such that it is just and reasonable to make an award of costs, as required by s 257D(1)(d) of the Criminal Procedure Act, which relevantly states:

(1) Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in proceedings under this Part unless the court is satisfied as to one or more of the following:
...
(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.

(f) Section 68 of the Court Act cannot stand together with Part 5 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

17The defendant relies upon the following submissions, as I understand them.

(a) The effect of the judgments on the amended notice of motion was to put the prosecutor to an election, that is, to require the prosecutor to amend the summons as particularised by deleting those particulars it did not wish to pursue. By requiring the prosecutor to amend in this way the Court was thus enlivening the power under s 68 of the Court Act.

(b) The defendant's notice of motion for particulars was inextricably linked to its subsequent application in the amended notice of motion to have the summons dismissed on the basis that the charge was duplicitous; and furthermore, if the summons had been properly drafted, that is, in a way that was adequately particularised and was not duplicitous, the defendant would not have needed to apply for further and better particulars. Accordingly, the costs of that notice of motion are properly characterised as costs thrown away by reason of the need to amend the summons. It is thus just and reasonable to require the prosecutor to pay the defendant's costs as a condition of such leave being granted.

(c) In the event that ss 257C and 257D of the Criminal Procedure Act may be said to fetter the Court's discretion to award costs, those provisions do not affect the power to award costs under any other statutory provision, such as s 68 of the Court Act, or s 257F of the Criminal Procedure Act which states that a court may in proceedings under Part 5 order that one party pay costs if the matter is adjourned. That is, s 257C is a separate and independent head of power to s 68 of the Court Act.

18I find that the Court has jurisdiction to make an order for costs at this stage of the proceedings, notwithstanding the fact that s 257C of the Criminal Procedure Act states that a court ""may at the end of proceedings"" make an order that the prosecutor pay professional costs ""if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn"". Sections 257C of the Criminal Procedure Act and s 68(1) of the Court Act are separate heads of power. That is, s 257C does not exclude the operation of s 68(1). Section 68(4) states that the section does not apply in classes 1 - 4 of this Court's jurisdiction, the clear intention being that it applies to proceedings in the Class 5 (criminal) jurisdiction. The two provisions are not inconsistent and can operate together.

19In Wakool Shire Council v Garrision Cattle Feeders Pty Limited [2010] NSWLEC 199, Sheahan J found that a charge was bad for duplicity and granted leave to the prosecutor to amend and ordered the prosecutor to elect upon which of three available formulations of a charge it wished to proceed. His Honour also ordered the prosecutor to pay the defendant's costs. Although his Honour did not identify the source of the power to award costs, it must be assumed that the power to do so came from s 68 of the Court Act.

20In the present case, the effect of the notice of motion (including the amended notice of motion) brought by the defendant was that the prosecutor, after earlier resistance, provided the further particulars sought and the Court then effectively found in favour of the defendant by the findings of duplicity and requiring the prosecutor to amend the summons as particularised by electing which of the particulars it proposed to rely upon.

21In these circumstances the defendant will, of course, be fully entitled to the order for costs that it seeks. Not only was it successful in requiring the prosecutor to amend, but the whole of the prosecutor's conduct of the proceedings to date shows that the defendant was fully justified in bringing the notice of motion (and the amended notice of motion). I find that it is just and reasonable that the prosecutor pay the defendant's costs.

22Since s 68 of the Court Act is a separate head of power to ss 257C and 257D of the Criminal Procedure Act, the power may be exercised without the limitations on the power in s 257D. It is not necessary, therefore, that exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings must exist before costs may be awarded, as required by sub-s 257D(1)(d).

23However, if sub-s 257D(1)(d) were to apply, then it has been held that the expression ""exceptional circumstances"" in this context is broad and is essentially whether it is ""just and reasonable"" to make an order for costs: Halpin v Department of Gaming and Racing [2007] NSWSC 815. In that case Hall J considered the meaning of s 70 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, which provides for a prohibition on the award of costs in favour of an appellant whose conviction is set aside unless the appeal court is satisfied of the matters specified in s 70(1)(a) - (d). Those provisions are in similar terms to s 257D of the Criminal Procedure Act, including the requirement that ""because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award costs in favour of the appellant"": s 70(1)(d). Hall J said, at [65]:

The expression 'exceptional circumstances' is a broad one. Without it being necessary to define its outer limits, the question essentially is whether or not there was any relevant conduct by the prosecutor which would make it 'just and reasonable' to award costs in favour of the plaintiff.

24In so concluding, Hall J referred, at [66], to the judgment of Sully J in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v Maritime Services Board of New South Wales (1995) 36 NSWLR 552; 78 A Crim R 368, in which that Court determined that the requirement that an order be ""just and reasonable"" involves both a fair hearing and that the terms of the order finally made are reasonable, per Sully J at 561:

... the words of the section require that an order for the payment of costs pursuant to s 52 of the Act must be both just and reasonable. The order must be just in terms of the way in which it has been reached; and it must be reasonable in its actual terms.

25Accordingly, I find that s 257D does not apply to an order which is made under s 68 of the Court Act. If it were to apply then, as noted at [22] and [23] above, it is nevertheless just and reasonable to order the prosecutor to pay the defendant's costs which it now seeks. The condition imposed upon the power to make an order for costs in s 257D is satisfied.

26In conclusion, I find that it is appropriate that the prosecutor pay the defendant's costs thrown away upon the making of the necessary order for the amendment to the summons as particularised.

27I make the following orders:

1. That the prosecutor amend the summons as particularised by deleting the particulars to summons upon which it may no longer rely.

2. That the prosecutor pay the defendant's costs thrown away by reason of the amendment, such costs to include the following:

(a) the costs of and incidental to the defendant's notice of motion filed on 20 February 2012;

(b) the costs of and incidental to the defendant's amended notice of motion filed on 1 March 2012; and 

(c) the defendant's costs of 19, 20 and 21 March 2012.

		23 April 2012",2012-04-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2759057,R v Neil Andrew PETTERSEN [2012] NSWDC 153,"Sentence


1HIS HONOUR: Stand up please Mr Pettersen. My practice is to tell prisoners in advance what sentence I intend to impose. In your case I propose to fix a non-parole period of four years three months, an effective non-parole period of four years three months, and the balance of sentence will be three years. Take a seat, thanks very much. That involves a finding of special circumstances and I will explain the reason for that shortly.

2Neil Andrew Pettersen appears today for sentence in relation to two offences and requires me to take into account matters on a Form 1 in relation to one of those offences, hereinafter to be referred to as ""the principal offence"".

3The first offence in time is an allegation that the prisoner on 20 March 2011 at Rosehill in the State of New South Wales did conspire to break and enter the warehouse of The Perfume Network situated at ... Rosehill and then in the said ... warehouse did conspire to commit a serious indictable offence, to wit steal in circumstances of aggravation, to wit he was in company with other persons, namely, Yashar Gogani and other unknown persons.

4This offence is an offence contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900. It has a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Act"").

5The second offence in time, and the principal offence because it is the matter to which the Form 1 matters are related, is an allegation that the prisoner on 14 May 2011 at Belrose in the State of New South Wales did attempt to break into a certain building, to wit the warehouse of Bright Point within the curtilage of the dwelling warehouse belonging to Bright Point situated at 2 Minna Close, Belrose with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, to wit, steal in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, he was in the company of Shawn O'Mealey, Jack Dunn and other unknown persons.

6This is said to be an offence contrary to s 113(2) Crimes Act 1900 and has a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment but no standard nonparole period. The matters on the Form 1 are offences that are related to the commission of one or other of the two offences for which the prisoner is to be sentenced.

7Offence 3 on the Form 1 is an offence of taking and driving a conveyance, to wit, a motor vehicle, registration number BB58UH, without the consent of Jamil El Helwah. This was an offence committed on or about 20 March 2011, and, clearly on the facts available to me, was concerned with the taking without the consent of the owner of the motor vehicle that was proposed to be used in a breaking, entering and stealing or in reality a ""burglary"", which was called off when the offender and others realised that they were being followed by an undercover police officer.

8Items 1 and 2 on the Form 1 are both taking and driving a conveyance offences. The taking of two motor vehicles, one registration number NBK 50M, without the consent of the owner, and the other registration number YAA 477, without the consent of the owner, from Belrose, clearly in connection with the commission of the principal offence, which was proposed to be in effect a ""burglary"" upon commercial premises in the Belrose area.

9The facts of the matter are set out in a statement of facts, although I note the prisoner has given evidence in relation to the matter, which I have taken that into account. Before I turn to the facts, however, I note the prisoner was a person who - I am informed by the Crown and the defence - pleaded guilty at the Local Court. As I understood the matter in the course of submissions, without having a detailed history available to me, the prisoner had pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity to the principal offences and with no evidence to the contrary available to me I conclude that the prisoner is entitled to a discount of twenty-five per cent to recognise the utilitarian benefit of his pleas of guilty and his admissions of guilt to the matters on the Form 1.

10I note in relation to the matters with which I am concerned, the prisoner was on parole at the time of the commission of both of these offences and I note that as a consequence of his arrest in relation to this matter on 6 September 2011 his parole was revoked, as one would expect. Committing offences while subject to parole is a significant aggravating factor as is well known. Of course, there are various types of conditional liberty to which offenders can be subject. The courts have regularly taken a serious view of any breach of conditional liberty, but a breach of parole by committing offences of a character similar to the offences for which the offender was on parole in the first place, as I have said, is a significant aggravating factor. Of that there can be absolutely no doubt. 

11In considering the issue of the commencement date of any sentences I impose, I bear in mind that the prisoner's revocation of parole meant that he is required to serve the balance of parole between 6 September 2011 and 21 April 2012, that is this coming Saturday. I am mindful of the practical reality that, whilst awaiting the disposal of these matters, he would be denied any opportunity to make application for parole. But then again, of course, any sentence any person imposed on the prisoner in relation to these matters would expire well after the expiration of that sentence required to be served by reason of the parole being revoked.

12In considering a commencement date in relation to this sentence I have considered Simpson J's judgment in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Callaghan v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 58. Her Honour - without going through the judgment in detail - discussed a range of considerations of a discretionary character that arise in relation to a sentencing exercise where an offender is subject to a revocation of parole, and is serving a sentence consequently at the time that the offender comes before a Court to be sentenced in relation to other offences.

13Of course, it is within my power to commence the sentences that I am required to impose effectively from a date such as 21 April 2012. On the other hand, Simpson J referred to the double dipping effect of taking into account a breach of conditional liberty as an aggravating factor and following that course of action. Ultimately I have concluded that I should commence the sentences effectively that I will impose from 6 February 2012, which is, bearing in mind the fact the prisoner came back into custody on 6 September 2011, a period of five months after coming back into custody.

14To turn to the facts. The statement of facts is very detailed and deals with each of the offences in chronological order. The prisoner and Yashar Gogani were the subject of a police investigation well before the prisoner actually committed the offences with which I am concerned. This is not fully explained to me and seems to be, frankly, on its face, a situation somewhat at odds with the prisoner's explanation for his involvement in the commission of these offences. But be that as it may, telephone conversations were intercepted from January 2011 and what they revealed is that the prisoner had been planning with Gogani to break into The Perfume Network from as early as 2 February 2011. They, on that date, spoke to a person of ""Islander appearance"" who, as I understood the facts, was the same person of ""Islander appearance"" who was involved with the prisoner and Mr Gogani in the early hours of 21 March 2011 when the plan to ""knock over"" The Perfume Network was called off. 

15Gogani, Pettersen and the other man drove to the vicinity of the business complex at Rosehill where The Perfume Network was located and effectively did a reconnoitre of the location.

16On 8 March the prisoner and Gogani went to a Bunnings store at Artarmon and bought items consistent with implements to be used for a burglary or a breaking and entering, including a large set of bolt cutters, an axe and a pair of gardening gloves. Telephone intercepts revealed the plan unfolding over the following days. On Sunday 20 March 2011 Gogani picked up Mr Pettersen from an address at Cammeray. They travelled to North Parramatta. There Mr Gogani and Mr Pettersen got out of the vehicle; they both approached the vehicle BB58UH belonging to Jamil El Helwah 

17Item 3 on the Form 1 relates to this event. One or other of them, drove that vehicle away. It was the case that the prisoner was in fact seen in the driver's seat of the Isuzu truck at 11.41pm, approximately an hour and a half after they were seen to approach the vehicle. The two offenders, of course, being under constant police surveillance at this particular point of time. 

18When the prisoner was seen driving the vehicle he was seen to be parked near to Mr Gogani's motor vehicle; they then travelled in ""convoy"" to Parramatta. The car that had been unlawfully taken was left unsecured, with the ignition removed. This vehicle suffered extensive damage as a result. The vehicle was left 150 metres away from The Perfume Network. 

19The prisoner and Gogani then drove to Rydalmere, that is, away from the location of the planned crime, but the reason for that self-evidently was because a lawfully intercepted text message revealed that they had identified an undercover police officer had been following them. They called off the assistance of at least the Islander male, who was told that the job was ""off"" and was ""cancelled"". There is no doubt that they abandoned the car that had been previously taken and driven to Rydalmere because they understood they were under surveillance. 

20It is not without some significance that the vehicle that they took, that is, the vehicle belonging to Mr El Helwah, was in fact an Isuzu truck consistent with their intention of removing a large amount of property from The Perfume Network.

21At 5.15am on 1 April 2011 an unidentified person removed the fly screen from a side window of an address at Cammeray, lifted up the window and stole the car keys to a Mercedes C63 AMG station wagon. This was a high performance vehicle. It bore the New South Wales registration plates NBK 50M. The vehicle was then stolen from the garage of the premises. A surveillance device warrant, authorising the use of listening devices, was issued on 7 April 2011 and certain targets were identified including Mr Pettersen and Mr Dunn, who I understand is the brother of the prisoner's partner, either he or Mr O'Mealey, it doesn't matter much. 

22Between 6pm on 5 May and 12pm on 6 May the rear registration plate from motor vehicle AZT 38R, a 2006 silver Mercedes sedan, was stolen from a vehicle at Neutral Bay. On 6 May 2011 police located the stolen motor vehicle NBK 50M, bearing the stolen registration plate on the rear of it, inside a private garage at 2/15 Wilga Street, Bondi. Pettersen, according to the facts I have, arranged for the leasing of this garage from the owner. A listening device and tracking device was then installed in this vehicle by police. 

23I pause to point out that, although the facts do not state this directly, it is apparent from these facts that the prisoner had possession of this motor vehicle from at least 6 May 2011 because the vehicle was stolen from Cammeray where the prisoner was apparently living at the time, or at least was in a suburb that the prisoner did have a connection with, when he was picked up by Mr Gogani back in March 2011.

24On 14 May Mr Pettersen drove the stolen motor vehicle, as it has been described, that is the car that had been stolen from Cammeray, from the garage at Bondi, to Mount Vernon Lane, Glebe. O'Mealey was a passenger in the vehicle. The listening device recorded conversations between the two individuals inside the stolen motor vehicle were monitored and clearly Mr Pettersen and Mr O'Mealey were identified and a tracking device showed the vehicle being driven to various locations in Sydney. The recorded conversation suggests that O'Mealey collected a police portable radio and they later met up with the stolen motor vehicle MS 2530, being a black Audi RS4 wagon containing the co-accused Jack Dunn and two other unidentified males in Lilyfield. The two stolen vehicles then travelled together to Chatswood and later the offenders were seen to speak to each other.

25In relation to the take and drive conveyance, that is YAA 477, the two stolen vehicles travelled to 19 Pringle Avenue, Belrose. The occupants of both vehicles in the facts provided to me are said to have ""assisted in the theft of a white 2002 Toyota Hilux tabletop utility"" bearing New South Wales registration number YAA 477. This vehicle is owned by James Blackman who at no time gave permission for the car to be taken. Mr Blackman is not related to the man I sentenced fifteen minutes ago, another Mr Blackman.

26The three stolen vehicles then travelled in convoy to the premises at 2 Minna Close, Belrose. I hasten to say it is not without significance that this offender, in company with the other offenders, was responsible for the taking of a Toyota tabletop utility. The use of such a vehicle, clearly, was for the purposes of carrying away as much as, at least, the utility, if not all the vehicles, could carry away. This makes a complete nonsense of the claim of the prisoner that he was involved in this particular breaking and entering to recover goods that would enable him to pay five or six thousand dollars to another person. I am quite satisfied that he, at least, and the other offenders were concerned to break into commercial premises to steal as much as they could get away with, including Vodafone mobiles and iPhones. Bright Point Australia Pty Limited had a distribution centre for various telecommunications companies in New South Wales at 2 Minna Close, Belrose. The premises had twenty-four hour on-site security, closedcircuit television and a six foot steel fence around the site. 

27The stolen vehicle YAA 477 was recorded on security closedcircuit television to be driven through and breaking open the closed security gates with the other two vehicles following behind. The CCTV recorded the vehicles parking and occupants from the vehicle attacking the warehouse. Dunn and Pettersen remained in the driver's seat of the respective vehicles while the other three occupants, one of similar appearance to O'Mealey, used a crowbar to attempt to gain entry to the warehouse via the fire door. The three males caused damage to the door, however, they were unable to enter. 

28At 4.11am the three males returned to the vehicles, MBK 50M and MS 2530, which were then driven from the scene. YAA 477 was left on the premises. How extensively damaged it was from driving through the closed security gates I am not able to conclude, but certainly it was of no use to them if they could not take anything from inside the premises. Pettersen drove NBK 50M to a residential unit at 7 Grasmere Road, Cammeray where the vehicle was left parked and unattended. The other vehicles were driven to another location. I hasten to say this prisoner is not charged with the theft or the taking and driving without the owner's consent of vehicle MS 2530.

29Later on 14 May 2011 police retrieved the listening device contained within the Mercedes station wagon. In relation to this device it recorded conversations between Pettersen, O'Mealey and Dunn. Pettersen is recorded talking about the value of iPhones and the number of phones in a box, O'Mealey talked about using Windex to clean the vehicle. A Windex bottle was later found in the garage used to store the stolen Mercedes. Various DNA tests were undertaken in relation to that item. Police believe Dunn was the driver of the second stolen vehicle MS 2530 at relevant times. There is discussion between various parties about driving through the gates. Pettersen is recorded as discussing the fact that he would ""rather be driving the car"", the accused Dunn ""is driving as it handles a lot better in the wet"". 

30Gogani was arrested on 6 September 2011. Pettersen was arrested on 6 September 2011. He declined to be interviewed by police. Dunn was arrested on 12 September 2011. He declined to be interviewed. On 14 September 2011 O'Mealey was arrested. He likewise exercised his right to silence. I am informed at the moment this prisoner is the first of the offenders to be sentenced. Gogani is listed for committal for trial on 4 May 2011. Shawn O'Mealey has pleaded guilty, he is listed for mention in the District Court on 27 April 2012. Jack Dunn is listed for arraignment on 27 April 2012. 

31The Crown has told me that there is no evidence of which he is aware, nor has Ms Duchen, nor has the prisoner, drawn to my attention any evidence amongst the recorded conversations of the prisoner claiming that the only reason he was involved in the commission of any of these offences was to repay a debt of $5,000 owed by a friend of his to a third party that the prisoner claims was threatening the prisoner and his family, and there is no evidence from his family assembled in court to that fact. Although the prisoner claims that he never told his family or his close associates of the debt, or the threats that were made. 

32In that regard one must approach the prisoner's claims, both to the Probation and Parole Officer, to the psychologist and in this Court about his reasons for committing the offences, with considerable circumspection. They are unsupported by other evidence. No attempt has been made to produce evidence that might shed light upon the claim. Conveniently the person that the prisoner claims that he was assisting has fallen out with him, or the prisoner has fallen out with that person. It seems, I must say, on the face of it, highly unlikely that in the scheme of things, the urgency of the moment I assume occasioned by the threats, that the prisoner would have been involved with these two offences a couple of months apart if there were current threats being made.

33In any event I just cannot accept by reference to the second offence in time that the prisoner was planning only to take sufficient stolen property as to enable him to recover five or $6,000 to pay off the debt and was not seeking any personal benefit. Of course, I have already pointed to the absence of any evidence and any unguarded conversations which were recorded where the prisoner claimed that his motives were as altruistic as he claimed. It should be said that the prisoner was a most unimpressive witness and one would, as I have earlier said, by reason of his criminal history and the circumstances of the offending, approach the claims that he made with suspicion and circumspection. I accept, of course, from his evidence, that since he was released on parole he had complied with the parole requirements so far as reporting and the like. 

34His counsel, who skilfully represented his interests, seemed to downplay the fact that the breach of his parole arose from serious offending such as I am concerned with. The facts of the matter are that one might take the view that his compliance with the requirements of the Probation and Parole Service were really a matter of paying lip service to the requirements of parole. It certainly is the case that I am dealing here with the fact he committed serious offences on parole, serious offences not days apart or minutes apart or hours apart, but weeks apart during a period that he was on parole. 

35The Probation and Parole Service has prepared a report which has, it could be fairly said, some favourable observations about the prisoner, noting some disadvantage in his background but not striking disadvantage in his background. It observed that he had been in a stable relationship for five years. That stable relationship has not prevented him offending in serious respects. He has some history of drug usage but no drug usage is claimed as a reason for committing the current offences. He claimed that he was seeking to pay an outstanding debt of $5,000. Putting aside the fact that one has difficulty accepting the threats of which he claimed, the truth of the matter is he was prepared to commit these crimes for financial benefit and that is not denied by his counsel in her submissions. The Probation and Parole Service noted the prisoner admitted his guilt. But again the prisoner sought to take something of a confess and avoid approach to this offending. The Probation and Parole report states:

""It is assessed that Mr Pettersen understands the lasting impact his crimes have had on his family and that he has developed strategies to assist him to maintain a pro social lifestyle. He presented as positive and focused on his future with his partner and has realistic goals for his reintegration back into the community.""

36He is a person who needs assistance by the Probation and Parole Service to address his associates, his financial circumstances and employment. Although I note there is evidence available to the Court through a reference that there is employment available to him on his release in a plumbing business and as I said I give him credit for the fact that when previously released to parole he was able to maintain employment in various ways for a period of some fourteen months. 

37In that regard, I have taken into account the evidence of his mother who not only spoke of his regular employment but the fact that she believed that he was travelling on parole, to use my words, had a settled relationship with his girlfriend having lived with her, that is, the mother, up until June 2011 when he moved in with his girlfriend, as I understood her evidence of which I obviously do not have a transcript. She also said that for a period of time he had no driver's licence and she had been driving him to TAFE while he undertook a welding course. I must say, as an aside without any criticism of the prisoner, the last thing that a person is prone to burglary should be doing is undertaking welding courses. In any event, I accept that he was undertaking the welding course for proper purposes and not sinister purposes. It is important, however, to come back to the detail of the prisoner's criminal history because it is of considerable significance in a range of ways in this matter and not just because the prisoner was subject to parole.

38The prisoner was born on 21 February 1982, thus, in relation to the matters with which I am concerned at relevant times, the prisoner, as I would understand the matter, was twenty-nine years of age. He is an experienced criminal, in fact to quote from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of R v Pettersen [2009] NSWCCA 91 an appeal by this prisoner against the severity of penalties imposed upon him, I note Justice Grove in giving the lead judgment of the Court and detailing the prisoner's convictions at paras 19 and 20 of that judgment, observed that at that point the prisoner ""had accumulated a significant record of offending."" It is worth repeating some of it. He started appearing in Court in the year 2000 when, as I would understand it, he was eighteen years of age.

39His first conviction for taking and driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner was on 14 August 2002 for which he was sentenced to three months imprisonment. On 27 June 2002 he was convicted in the Sydney District Court of breaking and entering and stealing for which he was sentenced to fourteen months imprisonment. Apparently a matter was taken into account on a Form 1. On the same date he was convicted of taking and driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner for which he was sentenced to ten months imprisonment. According to the record I have, that sentence was suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. On the same date he was convicted of using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension and sentenced to ten months imprisonment commencing on 30 October 2001. On 13 August 2002 he was convicted in the Central Local Court, presumably whilst in custody in relation to the other matters, to terms of imprisonment in relation to driving a motor vehicle recklessly or in a manner dangerous to the public, damaging property and the like.

40On the same date he was convicted of larceny and having goods in custody said to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained. On 25 February 2003 he appeared at the Sydney District Court and was convicted of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. He was sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment to commence on 29 May 2005 with a nonparole period of two years commencing on that date. A number of matters were taken into account on a Form 1 including common assault and damage of property. On another offence of committing robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon he was sentenced to three years imprisonment to commence on 29 November 2002. On an offence of aggravated breaking and entering and commit serious indictable offence in company, an offence obviously very close in its terms to the offences with which I am concerned, he was sentenced to three years and six months imprisonment to commence on 29 May 2004 with a non-parole period of two years. He appealed against these penalties but abandoned his appeal. 

41It was not long after those sentences had either expired, or certainly the nonparole period had expired, that the prisoner was charged with further offences. In fact, as I would understand the Probation and Parole Service report, although it is not of any great importance at this time, the matters for which he was sentenced at Parramatta District Court on 22 September 2008 were offences committed while subject to the parole that had been ordered by the Sydney District Court back in 2003. 

42He was convicted on 22 September 2008 to terms of imprisonment, firstly, in relation to an offence of aggravated breaking and entering with intent to steal, I assume, in company, to a term of imprisonment of three years nine months with a non-parole period of two years. Those sentences were to commence on 22 July 2008. He was convicted of driving a vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public or recklessly or at a speed dangerous to the public to six months imprisonment. He appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and that judgment I have already noted. I have read the remarks of Justice Grove for the Court.

43I note a number of the matters that have been raised on this appeal were raised before Judge Ellis at Parramatta District Court back in 2008 and were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal. I note, for example, that when sentenced by his Honour Judge Ellis on 22 September 2008 that the prisoner was serving, or had been required to serve, the balance of the revoked parole. I note that his Honour and, of course, the Court of Criminal Appeal, had to consider the terms of Callaghan v The Queen, to which I have made reference. I note the prisoner expressed contrition for his involvement in the offences. Of course the matter that came to the Court of Criminal Appeal was a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the penalty imposed and I appreciate the Court dismissed the Crown appeal. I note the starting point of any sentence imposed in relation to the offence the subject of appeal was a term of five years imprisonment. There was some technical complaints dealt with by the Court that are of no moment, but as I have pointed out to the learned Crown Prosecutor, this Court is greatly assisted by having previous judgments relating to particular offenders or remarks on sentence for previous convictions in the District Court and the Supreme Court available to understand the case run on the current occasion in the context of what has gone before.

44A number of the matters that have been raised again on behalf of the prisoner were previously raised at least in 2008. I note from the Probation and Parole Service report that the prisoner has no custody infringements, his counsel submits that he is ""institutionalised"" to the extent that the records would reveal that he is to the extent that one could be ""comfortable"" in custody. I accept that submission put on behalf of the accused, and it is a matter I have taken into account in determining the nonparole period in the context of the terms of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. A psychological report has been tendered. It provides a detailed account of the prisoner's history which I have taken into account. He has had some setbacks in his upbringing but nothing that could be described as remarkable. In fact, very little was said in submissions about his background as informing this particular sentencing exercise, other than, of course, the extended periods of imprisonment that have previously been imposed.

45Of course, these psychological reports have been used time and time again for purposes that go beyond the expertise of the person writing the report. For example, learned counsel representing the accused, a very experienced practitioner in this Court, sought to submit that the accused by reason of the events occurring when previously in custody was suffering from some form of post traumatic stress disorder. My understanding of the report and my understanding of the qualifications of the reporter, who was not a medical practitioner but is a person with a Bachelor of Psychology with Honours and a Master of Psychology with Honours, is that the reporter is not qualified to make a ""medical"" diagnosis of the prisoner. Of course, the reporter is entitled, qualified and skilled enough to observe the clinical signs and report upon them and also qualified to interpret the results of tests that were administered. It must be fairly said that the reporter's coverage of the offences involves no critical analysis of the facts with other matters that a sentencing judge, for example, is required to take into account.

46I note in relation to the results of psychometric assessment that the depression, anxiety and stress scale was administered and his symptoms of ""depression and anxiety"" were on the ""extremely severe range."" It was said that:

""The relatively high scores are largely consistent with his presentations and his reports of vacillating negative mood states, rumination about past stresses and in particular the outcomes of sentencing, negative self perceptions and features of anxious arousal.""

47So far as the adult ADHD self report scale administered, it was concluded that the prisoner has difficulties with a limited range of items relating to poor sustained attention and behavioural animation. The results indicated that:

""Despite some ongoing features of attention problems Neil does not meet symptom range or intensity characteristics which are consistent with a high likelihood of adult attention deficits.""

48Another part of the scores obtained indicated that:

""He may further experience particular difficulties with maintaining attention to relevant stimuli, restlessness and control of impulsive behaviours.""

49The conclusion reached by the psychologist was that the objective testing revealed ""severe levels of depression and anxiety and some moderate symptoms of stressor present."" It said the scores were consistent with his presentation but also noted that the various symptoms of anxiety and distress are:

""To some degree reactive to exposure to potentially post traumatic events while in custody such as the death of an inmate. As such it is likely that Neil's experience of symptoms would be elevated at present by his placement in remand and impending possibility of a custodial sentence.""

50It noted that he suffered a severe level of ""psychological distress"" which would ""likely meet criteria for diagnosis of co-morbid mood and anxiety disorder at present."" 

51Of course, as I pointed out to counsel for the offender, one might have thought, and it was conceded so in part as I understood the submissions, that much of this symptomatology may well be reactive to the circumstances of pending sentencing proceedings which will inevitably, as he would have understood, lead to a further period of time in custody. He has some tendencies towards distractibility, impulsivity, restlessness and high arousal levels but nothing that is significant to explain his involvement in the commission of the offences with which I am concerned. His intellectual capacity is broadly within normal limits. He does not have any diagnosed psychiatric illness and no mental disability is revealed as a causal influence upon his criminal behaviour. The report notes his institutionalisation. It reports without comment or analysis the offender's claims in relation to the involvement in these crimes, which I have already commented upon. It noted the offender's claimed intention to ""minimise interaction with problem peers"" so as to reduce his risk of offending behaviour. However, the facts reveal, as he revealed in his own evidence, that at least one of his co-offenders was a person that he met in prison. I do not accept as a fact that the offender's offending was ""contextual to relatively isolated and unintended negotiations with the debtor peer and other antisocial parties."" There can be no doubt on the facts presented to me that the offender was a willing party to the commission of these offences and in fact played a leading role, certainly a significant role, in the planning and execution or attempted execution of the crimes that were planned. 

52I accept that the offender would benefit from counselling when in the wider community and I would not seek to second guess the analysis appearing at the bottom of p 10 of the report of the psychologist. The offender could no doubt well do with some counselling whilst in custody, but the extent to which that would be available is not clear on the evidence available to me.

53In sentencing the offender of course there are a large number of matters that I am required to take into account. Firstly, I am required to have regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the various purposes of sentencing therein described. I accept there must be some attention to the rehabilitation or the promotion of the rehabilitation of the offender, but the character of this offending, the background of the offender reflect upon the fact that there is a need for weight to be given to both general and personal deterrence. The offender certainly has not been deterred from offending in a serious way by previous terms of imprisonment. These offences or the general character of these offences cause me to have regard to the guideline judgment, albeit now of some thirteen years of age, of R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. I note of course in relation to what Grove J discussed in Ponfield the fact that the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act have considerably overtaken that guideline judgment. Many of the matters identified by his Honour as factors relevant to the assessment of the objective criminality of a particular crime have been absorbed into s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

54In regard to this matter, particularly the first offence in time, it has a standard non-parole period of five years. Of course I am sentencing the offender after a plea of guilty and I am sentencing the offender of course in the context of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R which reflected upon the judgment of the Court of Criminal appeal in R v Way (2004). It noted, amongst other things (between [16] and [29]) the fact that the fixing of a non-parole period is but one part of the larger task in passing appropriate sentence upon the particular offender, fixing the appropriate non-parole period is not to be treated as if it were the necessary starting point or the only important end point in framing a sentence to which Div 1A applies. I note of course amongst many other matters raised in Muldrock, and discussed in subsequent cases to which I will refer in a moment, that the High Court held that consideration of s 21A in the context of Pt 4 Div 1A requires an approach that is consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian v R. The judge is required to identify all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discuss their significance and then make a valued judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case. The standard non-parole period is a legislative guidepost together with the maximum sentence. The court is not required to undertaken a two stage approach to sentencing.

55In relation to this matter of course, noting some of the more recent judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal post Muldrock, such as Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 and the like, that the offence described as the first offence in time could reasonably be regarded as an offence within the ""mid range"" as contemplated under Pt 4 Div 1A. It was submitted by learned counsel for the offender that it was below the mid range, but this was an offence that involved the planning that occurred, according to the facts available to me, over a period of time between 2 February 2011 and 20 March 2011. It involved the offender agreeing to commit the offence in company with others. It involved the recruitment of persons other than Mr Gogani. It involved the purchase of special equipment for the purposes of perpetrating the principal crime. It involved an agreement to commit a crime at commercial premises at night in circumstances where one would have expected that the intention was to steal valuable property and a considerable amount of valuable property having regard to the character of the vehicle that had been stolen to effect the purpose of the conspiracy. 

56I appreciate of course, as Ms Duchen points out, that the actual principal crime, or the contemplated crime, was not completed. The commission of the crime was interrupted by the offender's realising that they were subject to police surveillance. But as I understand the matter, and I have heard no submission to the contrary and not being assisted any further, the offender has admitted to the offence of conspiracy to commit an aggravated breaking, entering and stealing. It is that crime that I am concerned with and I have to characterise that crime within the range of offences that constitute such a crime. The conspiracy clearly was of longstanding, and the offender's explanation for his involvement in it, even if accepted, which I do not accept, does not mitigate the objective seriousness of the offending behaviour. 

57That having been said, I approach the matter as the High Court has decreed in Muldrock. The standard non-parole period is a guidepost but not the definitive determinate of what the appropriate non-parole period should be or what the total sentence should be but provides some assistance or guidance. In any event, I have concluded in relation to that offence, bearing in mind I am required, as the authorities make clear, to fix a non-parole period in relation to it, that there are special circumstances which require an adjustment of the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of the sentence. 

58With regard to the other offence which requires consideration of the matters on the Form 1, there is no need to categorise it in terms of Pt 4 Div 1A. But it is an offence with very similar characteristics to the previous offence in time with a lesser maximum. This was a planned crime where the offenders stole a vehicles to effect the crime. It was committed in company with a number of people. Damage was done to the premises to effect entry which was unsuccessful including smashing through the security gates and trying to force entry into the premises. The offenders were planning to break into commercial premises at night where it might be expected that a considerable amount of valuable property could be stolen, particularly telecommunications equipment which is readily capable of being sold illegally, provided people have access to SIM cards and the like. 

59With regard to both offences considering the terms of s 21A and noting of course the general sentencing principles that are contemplated pursuant to s 21A(1), the specific aggravating factors that I find in relation to this matter affecting both offences with which I am concerned under s 21A(2), are that the offences were committed whilst the offender was subject to conditional liberty and that the offences were committed for financial gain. Of course every breaking, entering and stealing or similar offence, to be fair, would be committed one would have thought by and large for financial gain. Here the gain was potentially great, certainly greater than the normal offence at domestic premises. Likewise in relation to each offence, each offence was part of planned criminal activity beyond the normal planning or the planning that might not be seen as an aggravation in such offending. I have dealt with the issue of the extent of planning in relation to both offences by reference to the facts and other matters.

60In addition to those aggravating factors common to both offences, in respect of the principal offence, which requires consideration of the Form 1 matters, the damage caused to the premises of the business that was raided was substantial. Of course s 21A matters are not directly relevant to the matters on the Form 1, but I note that two of the motor vehicles were stolen or taken by the offender, both of which were used in relation to particular crimes, the subject of sentence, were themselves damaged by the offender. One had damage to the ignition and, as I have said earlier, one driven through the security gates must have suffered some damage, but I do not have precise particulars. In any event, I am not required to determine relevant ""aggravating factors"" arising under s 21A in relation to the matters on the Form 1. 

61In relation to mitigating factors that arise in relation to the subject offences under s 21A(3), there is little that can be said. It might be fairly said in relation to the conspiracy matter that the loss or damage was not substantial, there was no loss or damage in fact, but otherwise the offender does have a significant record of previous convictions. He is not a person of good character. He is not a person who could be said to be unlikely to re-offend, and I could not conclude, given his past history and the circumstances that bring him here, that he has ""good prospects of rehabilitation."" Those mitigating matters expressed in subs (3) are not available to him. 

62The offender has expressed remorse. He claims to have accepted responsibility for his actions, acknowledged the loss or damage. Taking into account that he has previously expressed remorse when sentenced in 2008 and has put the lie to that by his subsequent behaviour, one might be reasonably acting if one approached that claim of remorse with some circumspection. But for the purposes of these proceedings I am prepared to accept it as a ""mitigating factor"" in relation to the two offences with which I am concerned. 

63The pleas of guilty in relation to each offence are mitigating factors. However, they also are matters for which he receives the benefit of a discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.

64With regard to the issue of his prospects of rehabilitation, it was put to me that the offender is a person who is ""at the cross roads"" in the sense discussed in the well known decision of Osenkowski. This matter might be considered in the context of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Blackman and Walters (2001) NSWCCA 121. In that judgment Wood CJ at CL discussed the line of South Australian authority which he embraced dealing with issues concerned with the promotion of the rehabilitation of offenders and the like. Amongst the decisions he referred to were Kovacevic (2000) 111 A Crim R 131, Yardley and Betts (1979) 22 SASR 108 particularly at 112-3 in the judgment of King CJ and related authorities. Osenkowski contemplated a positive finding that a person is at the crossroads. This offender could not be at the cross roads at the moment. He might be heading in that direction. It is difficult to say. But the fact that he committed these offences at the age of twentynine whilst on parole, the fact that he expresses regret now and looks to a better future in the contemplation of release to parole does not, with all the other evidence, warrant a conclusion that he is at the crossroads. I appreciate, as was pointed out in Blackman and Walters that the protection of the community is contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. 

65If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life, the protection of the community is impaired. If a sentence induces or assists someone to avoid offending in the future, the protection of the community is to that extent enhanced. Of course, this prisoner has shown by his involvement in these offences that he has quite settled criminal habits that he usually resorts to when the need arises, even on his own version of events. I point out that Osenkowski was discussed by Wood CJ in Henry v The Queen, particularly in the context of the mitigating considerations that might arise in relation to drug addiction when dealing with armed robbers (at [273]). 

66In any event, as the Crown correctly submitted this offender is not at the crossroads yet, it will be a matter for the Parole Authority, in due course, to determine if the prisoner is sufficiently placed at the crossroads to warrant any special consideration some time in the future. It follows from all that I have said thus far that I have had close regard to all the submissions that have been put by the prisoner and the learned counsel for the accused. The facts of the matter are as is acknowledged that a substantial term of imprisonment is to be imposed. I have earlier that I am prepared to make a finding of special circumstances. The special circumstances include the accumulation of sentences required upon the balance of parole and the imposition of one sentence in relation to another at this particular point of time. The prisoner because of his institutionalisation requires special assistance from the parole board to adjust to community living. It is to be fairly said that he showed no evidence to his mother of any difficulties adjusting to community living on the last occasion, but that need still remains. Although he no longer is under any drug addiction or drug dependency problem the truth of the matter is he will need professional assistance to avoid those temptations in the future and I accept that he needs an extended period of supervision for that. In my view, three years is an adequate period of time for that supervision.

67I have given these remarks today having heard the evidence and the submissions earlier today and then interposed another sentence matter which I have now completed. I gave some thought to delaying the sentence to further contemplate the matters that have been raised, but I believe that notwithstanding the absence of any transcript and notwithstanding the imposition of another matter in the meantime for me to deal with, I have had ample opportunity to reflect upon the matters that have been raised through the evidence and through the submissions.

68The Crown is correct to say that this is serious offending by an offender whose criminal history at the very least does not entitle him to any leniency, aggravated most significantly by the fact that he was on parole in relation to offending of a very similar character to the offending with which I am now concerned.

69In relation to the offence committed in May 2011 contrary to s 113(2), taking into account all the matters on the Form 1, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of three years and nine months. This reflects a commencement of five years imprisonment with a discount of twenty-five percent. That sentence will date from 6 February 2012 and expire on 5 November 2016. In relation to taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I have had close regard to the Attorney General's Application Number 1 (2002) (2002 56 NSWLR 147), particularly the matters such as the fact that the matters to be taken into account on a Form 1 mean that greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence in the communities entitlement to extract retribution. The entire point of the process may be to impose a longer sentence, although alter the nature of the sentence that would have been imposed if the principal offence had stood alone, sometimes the additional penalty would be substantial, although the Court is not obliged to fix any particular extent to which the sentencing for the principal offence is affected by taking into account the matters on the Form 1. There are restrictions upon the extent to which the matters on the Form 1 can be taken into account in any event, such as the maximum penalty and the like as discussed in the guideline judgment. What is significant to hear about the Form 1 matters of course is that they are offences committed to facilitate the commission as I have outlined in the summary of the facts. The principal offence and other offending, they are not ""quite slight"" or ""inconsequential"" matters as was the case in the matter I dealt with earlier this afternoon.

70In relation to the offence committed in March 2011, this is the conspiracy to commit the offence of aggravated breaking entering and stealing, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a nonparole period of three years. That non-parole period will commence on 6 May 2013 and will expire on my calculation on 5 May 2016. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of three years imprisonment. In relation to that non-parole period that sentence reflects a finding of special circumstances, not just through the accumulation, but making some adjustment to extend the period of potential parole supervision to meet the matters that I have outlined. The commencement point of that sentence was eight years imprisonment. I have given you a discount of twenty-five per cent as I have earlier foreshadowed.

71The nonparole period of course does not allow me to direct that the prisoner be released to parole, it will be a matter for the parole authorities as to whether you are released at the expiration of that non-parole period.

72Now Mr Crown any technical matters from you?

73VAUTIN: No, I think that is correct. I will ask that a transcript be taken out for the remarks on sentence your Honour.

74HIS HONOUR: That will be done in due course, probably if you wish it, you just make an application but I will ask my Associate to request it the remarks on sentence be prepared.

75VAUTIN: Thank you your Honour.

76HIS HONOUR: Now my calculation of the sentence Mr Pettersen is that the non-parole period is effectively four years and three months. The balance of sentence on my calculation is three years imprisonment, which means a total sentence of seven years, three months imprisonment. That sentence commencing part way through the balance of parole to which I earlier referred.

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R S HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J and with his Honour's reasons.

3R A HULME J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of one of two sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Walmsley SC in the Sydney District Court on 4 November 2010.

4The applicant had pleaded guilty to two offences and asked that further offences be taken into account on sentence.

5In respect of an offence of supplying ecstasy (""the drug supply offence""), the applicant asked that offences of supplying cocaine, dealing with the proceeds of crime and possessing cannabis be taken into account.

6In respect of an offence of possessing an unauthorised and prohibited firearm (a shortened 12 gauge pump action shotgun) (""the firearm offence""), the applicant asked that offences of possessing an unregistered firearm (a rifle), not keeping a firearm safely and possessing ammunition without a licence or permit be taken into account.

7For the drug supply offence there was a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of $220,000: s 25(1) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

8For the firearm offence there was a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years: s 7(1) Firearms Act 1996 and Pt 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

9For the drug supply offence the judge imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months. For the firearm offence there was a sentence of 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year. A period of partial accumulation was ordered so that the sentence for the firearm offence commenced 8 months after the commencement of the sentence for the drug supply offence. Accordingly, the aggregate sentence was one of 3 years 2 months with 1 year 8 months to be served before release on parole. 

10The applicant relies upon 3 grounds of appeal, each relating to the sentence for the firearm offence. There is no complaint about the sentence for the drug supply offence and nor, in my view, could there be when the judge found that it was ""a little less than mid-range"", the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 15 year, and the sentence was 18 months.

Facts

11There was a statement of agreed facts tendered before the judge. It revealed that some of the items the subject of the charges were found in the applicant's car when it was seen by police parked outside the clubhouse of the Nomads outlaw motorcycle gang in Marrickville on 8 August 2009. Further items were found on 13 August 2009 when the police investigation led them to the home of a friend of the applicant in Maroubra, and on 17 September 2009 when the applicant was arrested at Cronulla. In aggregate, the applicant was in possession of the following:


125 tablets (34.16 grams) of ecstasy (drug supply offence).


7 plastic resealable bags containing 7.96 grams of cocaine (Form 1 drug supply offence).


$10,839 in cash (Form 1 proceeds of crime offence).


2.2 grams of cannabis (Form 1 cannabis possession offence).


A 12 gauge pump action shot gun (firearm offence). It is not stated in the agreed facts but the applicant gave evidence that it was shortened (POS 43.28).


A Sterling 15 rifle (Form 1 firearm offence).


A magazine containing 5 rounds of .22 calibre ammunition loaded in the rifle together with a further 94 rounds of such ammunition (Form 1 ammunition offence).


2 mobile phones; SIM cards; and 6 unused prepaid mobile phone cards.


A driver's licence in another name.


A quantity of plastic resealable bags and plastic spoons, and a set of scales.

12The police inquiries revealed that on 9 August 2009, the day after the applicant's car was searched by police, a man named Lawrence Lignow attended the applicant's home and removed a mattress. The firearms and ammunition were hidden inside the mattress. Mr Lignow was arrested and charged. He told police that he had an arrangement with the applicant that he would remove and secrete these items if ever the applicant got into trouble.

13The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. He said that he bought the firearms in Townsville a long time ago and used them for hunting. His family had a farm. He had air rifles when he was small. In cross-examination he said that he bought the firearms in about 2002 or 2003 from a friend at a hotel (POS 25). He acknowledged that his acquisition of them was unlawful (POS 25.29). He kept the firearms at home while he was in Queensland and brought them with him when he moved to Sydney. They were left in his car parked outside his parents' home when he was overseas for six to eight months in 2008. Thereafter he hid them in a cupboard in his home (POS 25 - 27). It was Mr Lignow who put them in a mattress in order to secrete and take them away from the applicant's home (POS 28).

14The applicant confirmed that he had used the firearms (plural) for hunting rabbits and the like (POS 29). Later, in response to questions by the judge, the applicant said that the shotgun was already shortened when he bought it. He then said that he had not used that gun for hunting but only the rifle. He said ""the shotgun was never active, the trigger mechanism I never received for it your Honour"" (POS 43). Why the applicant purchased and then retained for so many years a shortened shotgun that could not be used was not explained.

Findings made concerning the offences

15In relation to the offence of supplying ecstasy, the judge noted that the indictable quantity prescribed for this drug is 1.25 grams and the commercial quantity is 125 grams. In this case there were 34.16 grams, which was about 27 times the indictable quantity.

16His Honour said that there was ""substantial evidence that the offender was involved in supply for financial gain"" (ROS at [6]). He referred in this context to the drugs and the money found in the car as well as to the finding of re-sealable plastic bags, SIM cards, scales, plastic spoons, a customer list and the like. He found that the offence was ""a little less than mid-range"". Later, his Honour referred to the applicant's claim that he only sold drugs to feed his own consumption and said that he rejected it, saying that the customer list, drug paraphernalia and SIM cards indicated a form of activity greater than the applicant was prepared to concede. He also rejected claims that he did not know of the multiple phone cards in his car and that he had two mobile phones because he was seeing two girlfriends (ROS [10]).

17In relation to the firearm offence, his Honour accepted the applicant's evidence that the shotgun did not function because the trigger mechanism had been removed before the applicant purchased it. The judge also noted that there was no ammunition for this gun and that there was no evidence that it had been used in the course of any drug offences. He noted that it was ""an extremely significant offence"" but nevertheless found that it was ""a low range offence of its kind"" (ROS [7]).

Subjective circumstances

18The sentencing judge referred at some length to the applicant's personal circumstances. There is no complaint about the manner in which such matters were taken into account and so they require only brief mention.

19The applicant was aged 26 at the time of the offences. He had no previous convictions which the judge said was a matter entitling him to ""some leniency"".

20The applicant came from a close and supportive family. He left school after Year 11 and joined the Australian Army. He served in Australia and on peacekeeping missions in East Timor in 2001 and 2005 and in the Solomon Islands in 2003. He witnessed the death of a civilian in East Timor in 2001. He also experienced the deaths of members of his extended family. The judge noted that it seemed that the applicant sought refuge in drugs and alcohol as a result of these events.

21Counselling assisted the applicant in respect of alcohol but he continued using drugs. The breakdown of a relationship exacerbated this problem.

22The judge described the applicant's army career as ""impressive"". When he left the army in January 2008, the applicant travelled overseas and then worked in security, as a gym attendant and in the Army Reserve. At the time of sentencing he was employed as a labourer.

23The judge noted that the applicant had a ""great deal of support from his family"", noting in this context that his parents, friends and partner were present in court.

24The applicant gave evidence that the history he had provided to the author of a psychological report, Dr John Jacmon, was truthful. Dr Jacmon's opinion was that the applicant had symptoms of borderline personality disorder and that drug use made him aggressive and of poor judgment. The applicant's evidence was that he was willing to adopt Dr Jacmon's recommendations as to treatment.

25The judge regarded it as a ""significant part of the offender's subjective case"" that his mother had advanced breast cancer and that the applicant had been playing a significant role in her care. She gave evidence about how helpful he had been. The judge acknowledged restrictions in the extent to which he could take family hardship into account. His Honour noted in this respect that it had not been established that care for the applicant's mother could not be provided by her husband or by friends.

26Other matters that were taken into account included that the applicant was remorseful, although this was limited because he had not been completely candid about certain aspects of the offences. His Honour was satisfied that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. A reduction of sentence of 25 per cent was allowed in recognition of the applicant's early pleas of guilty.

Grounds of appeal

27There are three grounds of appeal. The first and second are concerned with the parity principle: whether the sentence for the firearm offence offended the parity principle and whether the judge erred by holding that ""parity does not apply"". The third contends that the sentence for the firearm offence is manifestly excessive. It is appropriate to first consider the third ground. If it is made out, the other grounds would be otiose.

Ground 3: The sentence imposed for the offence of unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm was in any case manifestly excessive

28A number of factors were adverted to in support of the submission that the sentence for the firearm offence was manifestly excessive. The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had never used the shot gun. It was in an incomplete state because it had no trigger mechanism and was incapable of being discharged. There was no ammunition associated with it. There was no suggestion of the gun being associated with illegal drug supply activity and no suggestion of it finding its way into the hands of ""the criminal underworld"". The sentencing judge found that it was a low range offence.

29Reference was also made to the applicant having entered an early plea of guilty and having no previous convictions. It was submitted that there was ""demonstrated remorse and insight into his anti-social behaviour"". Further, the sentencing judge found that there were special circumstances under s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) 1999 which justified a longer parole and shorter non-parole period.

30The written submissions by counsel for the applicant concluded by stating, ""It was open to mollify the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant"".

31Counsel for the Crown approached the matter by identifying the actual period the applicant would spend in custody referrable only to the firearm offence. The sentence for the drug supply offence was a fixed term of 18 months. Thereafter, the applicant would remain in custody solely in respect of the sentence for the firearm offence for 2 months.

32With respect, I do not feel there is any merit in that analysis. It may, perhaps, be a relevant consideration if any of the grounds were upheld and the Court was contemplating intervention. The accumulation of a sentence, whether partially or wholly, upon another sentence does not mean that it is any less than what it is. The analysis engaged in by the Crown ignores the rationale for the principle of totality: see, for example, Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63. This was a matter that the judge was required to consider after first determining the sentences for the individual offences: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45]. 

33The Crown's analysis also ignores the fact that there is a subsequent period of 18 months during which the applicant will be on parole. As Simpson J observed in R v Moore [2012] NSWCCA 3 at [38], ""a period of parole is in itself a sentence"".

34The imposition of a sentence is a discretionary decision that can only be interfered with by this Court on House v The King principles ([1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505). Intervention by an appellate court is not justified on the basis that it was ""open to mollify the sentence"".

35No patent error was sought to be identified on behalf of the applicant. Accordingly, the question is whether, having regard to all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender, a sentence of 2 years 6 months is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at 371 [25]. It is not simply a matter for this Court to substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge because it might have exercised the discretion in a different manner: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 672 [15]; cited in Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 339 [57]; and Markarian v The Queen at 371 [28].

36The judge found that the offence was ""a low range offence of its kind"" and there were a number of favourable findings made in relation to the applicant's subjective case. However, the judge was also required to have regard to the statutory guideposts of a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years. I am unable to conclude that the sentence, including the non-parole period, is manifestly excessive.

Ground 1: That the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the sentence imposed upon Lawrence Lignow for the same offence of possession of an authorised prohibited firearm.

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred by holding ""that parity does not apply"". 

37Both these grounds are advanced by the applicant concerned with the parity principle. Ground 2 may be disregarded. If ground 1 is made good, ground 2 is unnecessary. If ground 1 is not established, then ground 2 serves no practical purpose.

38Lawrence Lignow was charged with an offence concerning his possession of the shotgun. It was the same offence for which the applicant was sentenced: possession of an unauthorised prohibited firearm contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act. Such an offence must be dealt with summarily unless the prosecutor elects to have the matter dealt with on indictment: s 260(2) and Part 4 of Table 2 to Schedule 1 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. For an offence against s 7(1) of the Firearms Act, the maximum penalty that may be imposed in the Local Court is imprisonment for 2 years and/or a fine of 50 penalty units: s 268(2)(e1) Criminal Procedure Act. 50 penalty units means $5,500: s 17 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

39Mr Lignow was also charged with a large number of other offences: possession of prescribed restricted substances, contrary to the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (9 offences); supply of a substance contrary to that Act; possession of cocaine (1 gram), contrary to the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985; and receiving property stolen outside New South Wales (a set of speakers) contrary to s 189A of the Crimes Act 1900. He was also charged with possession of the applicant's rifle under both s 7A(1) and s 36(1) of the Firearms Act and not keeping a firearm safely under s 39(1)(a) of that Act. 

40Mr Lignow was convicted in the North Sydney Local Court on 22 December 2009. In each matter the presiding magistrate imposed fines ranging from $200 to $600 together with court costs of $76. The total imposition was $5,366. For each of the offences in common with the applicant, Mr Lignow was fined $250 (with court costs).

41A variety of matters were put in mitigation by senior counsel who appeared for Mr Lignow. The magistrate said that he took them all into account but he had particular regard to the fact that Mr Lignow had no previous convictions; implicitly, that he had good prospects of rehabilitation; his early pleas of guilty; and genuine remorse. The magistrate also gave a ""considerable benefit"" for Mr Lignow's ""considerable assistance to the authorities"".

42In relation to the firearms offences, the magistrate accepted that they were committed out of ""misplaced and extravagant loyalty to friends"". His Honour reproved Mr Lignow for having been ""silly"". 

43At the outset of the hearing before Judge Walmsley, the solicitor representing the Crown informed his Honour that Mr Lignow had been dealt with in the Local Court and that fines had been imposed. She said:

""I'd submit that parity doesn't apply as they are different charges and no strictly indictable offences and no supply prohibited drug offences"" (POS 2.22).

44Counsel for the applicant said in the course of her submissions:

""And I know my friend said parity was not [an] issue. The other gentlemen [sic] was given a $250 fine, but was not charged with exactly the same offence, as I understand it. Is that right, Madam Crown? But it was regarding the same guns.""

45The transcript records that the Crown representative responded, ""Only one"" (POS 54.5).

46Clearly, his Honour was inadvertently misinformed. As indicated above, Mr Lignow was charged with precisely the same offence as the applicant concerning the shotgun. Further, he was charged in respect of both the shotgun and the rifle.

47His Honour referred to this issue in his remarks on sentence:

[2] ... A co-offender, Mr Lignow, was dealt with in the North Sydney Local Court for the possession of unregistered firearm, goods in custody and numerous possess restricted substance charges. He was convicted and received fines for all offences and the Crown put to me, and I think correctly, that parity does not apply and that seemed to be the view of his counsel because she made no submissions on the matter. (Emphasis added.)

48It was submitted that the applicant ""has a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the extreme disparity of his punishment compared to that of Mr Lignow"" (AWS p.4). Both offenders were in possession of the same firearm and were charged with the same offence. It was submitted that ""the fact that Mr Lignow harboured the shotgun for the applicant does not make him any less culpable than the applicant, just as a receiver of stolen goods is no less culpable than the thief who provided the goods to the receiver"". 

49Counsel for the applicant referred in written submissions to the judgment of Howie J in Jimmy v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 (""Jimmy""):

[246] The principle, whether it is called parity or proportionality or relativity between sentences, should be applied to bring about a just result in the sentences imposed upon persons who have been engaged in the same criminal enterprise regardless of the charges that have actually been laid against the offenders. (Emphasis added.)

50Counsel's written submissions were filed prior to the High Court of Australia giving judgment in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2012) 86 ALJR 36 (""Green and Quinn""). That case was principally concerned with a Crown appeal being allowed and respondents being re-sentenced, where there was a question of the new sentence creating unacceptable disparity with the sentence imposed upon a co-offender who was not the subject of the Crown appeal. In the course of dealing with that issue there was consideration of the principle of parity in a general sense.

51It was Mr Wendler's submission on behalf of the applicant (23.2.12 at pp 1-2) that the effect of Green and Quinn was that the ""strictures of the application of the parity principle"" had been relaxed and that the ""focus is upon the substance, not form"". The fact that persons are not strictly co-offenders is not determinative. The issue is ""arriving at a just result with some flexibility"".

52Asked as to whether the applicant and Mr Lignow were engaged in the ""same criminal enterprise"", Mr Wendler's submission was that they both had possession of the same firearm and, although their possession was for different purposes and in different situations, ""the High Court's analysis ... wouldn't stop application of the parity principle"". The question was whether it was a ""just result"" that one man received a sentence of 2 years 6 months while the other received a fine of $250 (23.2.12 at p 3).

53It was accepted that the applicant should not have received the same imposition as Mr Lignow received, but it was submitted that ""it shouldn't have been a head sentence of two and a half years"" for an offence the judge described as ""low range"" (23.2.12 at p.4.20).

54When pressed as to the extent to which there should have been an amelioration of the applicant's sentence, Mr Wendler submitted that it should have been ""to the extent that he should be released or capable of being released on parole immediately"" (23.2.12 at 5.10) or ""almost immediately"" (23.2.12 at 8.36). The applicant is presently due to be released when the non-parole period for the firearm offence expires on 26 April 2012.

55For the Crown it was submitted that there were significant differences between the circumstances of the offence in relation to each of the applicant and Mr Lignow and there were also significant differences in their personal circumstances, including that Mr Lignow had given ""considerable"" assistance to authorities. Further, in the applicant's case, there were the additional offences to be taken into account on the Form 1. The disparity in the sentences was justified.

56The majority in the High Court (French CJ, Crennan and Keifel JJ) made the following observations concerning the parity principle in Green and Quinn:

[28] ""Equal justice"" embodies the norm expressed in the term ""equality before the law"". It is an aspect of the rule of law. It was characterised by Kelsen as ""the principle of legality, of lawfulness, which is immanent in every legal order."" It has been called ""the starting point of all other liberties."" It applies to the interpretation of statutes and thereby to the exercise of statutory powers. It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen:

""Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect."" (Emphasis in original.)

Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is ""a reflection of the notion of equal justice"" and ""is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice"". It finds expression in the ""parity principle"" which requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. As with the norm of ""equal justice"", which is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances.

[29] General concepts of ""systematic fairness"" and ""reasonable consistency"" in sentencing, as an aspect of the administration of federal criminal justice, were discussed in Hili v The Queen. They apply to persons charged with similar offences arising out of unrelated events. The consistency they require is ""consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles, not some numerical or mathematical equivalence."" That kind of general consistency is maintained by the decisions of intermediate courts of appeal. The consistency required by the parity principle is focussed on the particular case. It applies to the punishment of ""co-offenders"", albeit the limits of that term have not been defined with precision. 

[30] In Lowe v The Queen and in Postiglione v the Queen, this Court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise. Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged. The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v The Queen, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged. (Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.)

57Jimmy is authority for the proposition that the parity principle is not confined to co-offenders sentenced for ""the self-same crime"" and this was confirmed in Green and Quinn. The principal judgment in Jimmy was that of Campbell JA. In the course of, and following, a most extensive review of authorities in the High Court and intermediate courts of appeal, his Honour repeatedly referred to the issue being concerned with participants in a ""common criminal enterprise"" or the ""same criminal enterprise"". Howie J, who agreed with Campbell JA, used the term, ""persons who have been engaged in the same criminal enterprise"".

58In Green and Quinn, the High Court was concerned with a comparison of the sentences imposed upon the appellants with the sentence imposed upon a third person, Taylor. The appellants were sentenced for cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis plants. Taylor was sentenced for knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of cannabis. The majority judgment identified (at [8]) each of the three men as having been involved in ""a commercial enterprise for the cultivation of cannabis plants and the production of cannabis leaf for supply"".

59In Jimmy the applicant and the offenders who were being compared, Huang and Siu, were charged with money laundering offences involving their transmission overseas of various sums of money on behalf of a man named Chen. Campbell JA explained the differences between the three offenders thus:

[204] There is no basis in the Agreed Facts for concluding that the Applicant knew of the existence of Huang or Siu. There is no basis in the Agreed Facts for concluding that the Applicant knew that Mr Chen had ever engaged another person to take money to the bank for remission to Hong Kong in parcels of less than $10,000. The period when the Applicant was taking money to the bank for Mr Chen did not coincide, or even overlap, with the periods when Siu and Huang were taking money to the bank for Mr Chen. The sums of money that the Applicant remitted to Hong Kong are different to the sums of money that each of Huang and Siu remitted to Hong Kong. Thus, the Applicant, Siu and Huang, did not commit the same crime. However, it is clear that the Applicant, Siu and Huang were all being used by Mr Chen as part of an enterprise involving the repeated commission of crimes of a similar character. That suffices, in my view, to make them participants in a common criminal enterprise. The Crown's submission that the parity principle cannot apply because they are not co-offenders in the relevant sense fails. (Emphasis added.)

60In the present case, it is doubtful that there was a ""criminal enterprise"" at all, let alone one in which the applicant and Mr Lignow were both involved. Certainly, they were charged with the same offence in respect of the same shotgun. However, if one looks at ""substance rather than form"" (Green and Quinn at [30]), the applicant's offence was concerned with his ownership of the shotgun which he had purchased and illegally possessed for many years. Mr Lignow, on the other hand, had possession of the shotgun for 3 days in circumstances in which he was secreting it on the applicant's behalf out of ""misplaced and extravagant loyalty"" to a friend.

61In these circumstances, it cannot be said, in my view, that there was a common (or the same) criminal enterprise in which each was engaged. It is as inappropriate to compare the sentences imposed on each as it was to compare the sentence imposed upon a supplier of heroin with the sentence imposed upon the offender from whom the heroin was sourced: Meager v R [2009] NSWCCA 215.

62Even if the parity principle did apply, I am not persuaded that there can be any legitimate sense of grievance arising from the vastly more lenient outcome in Mr Lignow's case. The difference in the nature of the offences and the personal circumstances of the offenders justified a substantial difference in the sentence imposed in the applicant's case.

63There is not merit in either of these grounds.

Orders 

64I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

2759068,Van Dung Nguyen v R [2012] NSWCCA 42,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ AT CL:     I agree with Davies J.

2DAVIES J:  On 16 February 2011 the Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of cultivating by enhanced indoor means a number of prohibited plants (being cannabis) not less than the commercial quantity contrary to s 23(2)(a) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 3500 penalty units.

3Judge Sides QC sentenced the Applicant to a period of imprisonment for 3 years non-parole with an additional terms of 2 years and 3 months. This sentence was imposed after his Honour allowed a 25% discount for an early plea. 

4At the same time his Honour sentenced two other offenders who had pleaded guilty to knowingly take part in the cultivation of the same cannabis plants. Each of those offenders was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 15 months non-parole with an additional term of 15 months. 

5The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him principally on the grounds of parity, and also because it is alleged that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

The facts

6The following facts were found by the Sentencing Judge.

7At about 6.25am on Thursday 29 July 2010 police officers executed a lawfully obtained search warrant at premises at 5 Amanda Place, Ingleburn. Shortly after they knocked on the front door they were greeted by the Applicant Van and the co-offender Thu. They are boyfriend and girlfriend. During a search of the premises the police located the other co-offender Son hiding behind a desk in the garage area. He is a Canadian citizen and was visiting Australia on a tourist visa at the time. He is the half-brother of Van.

8When they searched the premises the police located a total of 157 cannabis plants growing in four different rooms by hydroponic means with the assistance of lights as well as some filters. The electricity meter box had been bypassed. It is clear and there is no dispute that the plants were being cultivated by enhanced indoor means.

9In one room there were 50 cannabis plants that were about 30 centimetres high. Another room contained 44 cannabis plants that were about 10 centimetres in height. 26 cannabis plants were located in a third room and these were about 50 centimetres in height. In a large sunroom at the rear of the premises police found 37 cannabis plants that were approximately 100 centimetres in height. In the bathroom the police located five seedlings that had yet to produce any roots. These are not part of the 157 cannabis plants the subject of the charge.

10The Applicant walked through the premises with the police and during this process, he made admissions that the rooms contained cannabis plants that he tendered and nurtured. He also advised the police that the heat lights in each room were powered by electricity that was obtained free because the meter had been bypassed.

11Police arrested all three offenders and they were taken to the police station.

12The Applicant participated in an ERISP interview and made full admissions to having cultivated the plants by enhanced indoor means and detailed an extensive knowledge of and ability to cultivate. He told the police he started growing the plants to obtain money.

13Son also participated in an interview with the police and said that he had come to Australia about seven months before and had lived with various members of his family including the Applicant. He claimed that he only stayed at the premises where the plantation was found the night before and had no property there because his visit was short. However, in the bedroom he was occupying the police found numerous articles of clothing suitable to be worn by a man and an empty bag with an old wallet and identification. Further items in this room included a mobile phone plugged into a charger and a laptop computer. According to the Statement of agreed Facts: ""The room he was occupying was consistent with a room being lived in by a person on a long term basis and not as an overnight visitor.""

14Thu also participated in an ERISP interview. She told police that she had visited the address where the plantation was found on five occasions in the last month. During their search the police observed a large amount of women's clothing throughout the bedroom area and also located her toothbrush, makeup, laptop computer and documents in her name.

15In a hallway outside one of the bedrooms the police found six transformers in a cupboard. They found a further 30 transformers hidden in the roof cavity of the premises. The evidence discloses that the police found the fingerprints of the Applicant Van on a power board, two transformers, a charcoal filter and a globe. They found the fingerprints of Son on a switch and a globe and the fingerprints of Thu on a transformer.

16According to the Statement of Agreed Facts, the criminality of Son and Thu arises on the basis that they assisted the Applicant in the cultivation process by moving and arranging hydroponic equipment to various parts of the premises. They also assisted in maintaining the premises so that it appeared normal to people in the local area, thereby reducing any suspicion of illegal activity.

Subjective features

17The Applicant was born in Vietnam and came to Australia in 1991. He became a citizen in 1994. He is 34 years of age. 

18He had been in a relationship with Thu. He had one child to that relationship, and he had a child born to a woman with whom he had an earlier relationship. Although it appeared to be the case that Thu was living at the premises, she came to be separated from the Applicant and there were no plans for them to rekindle their relationship. 

19The Applicant claimed to have developed a gambling problem whilst he was at school and had accumulated a debt of some $10,000 on a credit card prior to his arrest. There was no evidence that he had any substance abuse problem, any mental health problems or an intellectual disability. He had no prior convictions.

20He claimed to have set the cultivation up as a result of finding the hydroponic equipment in a park in Liverpool. He said he did it to pay off his debt. The Sentencing Judge doubted his credibility concerning the finding of the equipment partly because of its value and partly because he persistently lied to the probation officer by claiming that the two co-offenders played no active role in the offence. 

21The Sentencing Judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was premeditated and motivated by greed. Given that the plants were different sizes he was satisfied that the venture was an ongoing one. 

22The Sentencing Judge found that the Applicant was clearly the instigator and his Honour was satisfied that the Applicant effectively recruited the other two to assist. 

23His Honour noted that there was no evidence the Applicant had acknowledged the potential harm of the offence, and that this fact disentitled him to any leniency because of remorse.


Ground 1: Parity
Ground 2: Sentence manifestly excessive

24For reasons that will become apparent, it is appropriate to consider both grounds together, although I will deal first with principles associated with parity and how his Honour dealt with that matter.

25A useful summary of matters with which the parity principle is concerned is to be found in Rees v R [2012] NSWCCA 47 in the judgment of Garling J (with whom Macfarlan JA and R S Hulme J agreed) at [50], and I have regard to those matters in what follows.

26The Applicant says that he has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity of the sentence imposed upon him compared to the sentences imposed on the co-offenders.

27In Rae v R [2011] NSWCCA 211 Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed) said at [68]:

This court has observed that considerable obstacles are faced by an applicant seeking to invoke the parity principle in circumstances where the sentencing Judge was fully aware of the sentences imposed upon a co-offender and the reasons for those sentences, and indicates in the sentencing remarks why the Judge is departing from the co-offender's sentence: Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [58].

28The Sentencing Judge made these observations about the respective roles of the three offenders:

(1)  Having doubted the Applicant's account of having come upon the hydroponic equipment in a park, his Honour said:

Even if true he had the wherewithal to set up the equipment, obtain and grow the plants... and to bypass the electricity meter box.

(2)  He also said:

... there is no evidence that anyone apart from these three were involved in the plantation, he was clearly the instigator and the Court is satisfied that he effectively recruited the other two.

(3)  A little later:

The Court is satisfied the Offender Van instigated the offence, set up the equipment and attended to the plants. The other two helped him. There is no evidence that they did so in a spontaneous way. In the Court's view, their roles were premeditated and, on the face of it, their roles were similar to one another and substantially less than the role and criminality of the Offender Van.

(4)  Again:
In the case of the Offender Van the Court is satisfied that he was motivated by a desire to earn profits... There is no evidence about what the other two were to receive for their role in the venture but, in the absence of evidence on the topic, the Court is satisfied that the only conclusion it can come to is that they were involved for financial reasons.

(5)  Finally, his Honour considered a number of cases decided by this Court, and said:

The criminality for the Offender Van is higher than for the appellant in the cases of Nguyen v R [2009] NSWCCA 181; Truong v R [2009] NSWCCA 41; and Pham v R [2009] NSWCCA 266.... In terms of roles, his case is closer to that of the appellant in Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 322, but that case involved only a little over twice the commercial quantity: The role of the other two is more akin to the roles of the appellants in the first three mentioned cases.

29These observations demonstrate clearly that the Sentencing Judge had the parity principle in mind when he sentenced each of the offenders. It is not suggested that his Honour made factual errors in the assessment of the different roles of the offenders.

30Further, his Honour noted some particular matters of hardship to Son and Thu by reason of their imprisonment. In Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 86 ALJR 36 French CJ, Crennan & Kiefel JJ said at [31]:

The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders, such as age, background, criminal history, general character and part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.

31For these reasons, as a matter of principle, no error has been shown in imposing different sentences. The further question is whether the difference is significant and bespeaks error. It is necessary when comparing the sentences to consider whether the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders were inadequate, and also whether (ignoring the co-offenders' sentences) the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was manifestly excessive.

32With regard to the adequacy of the sentences imposed on the co-offenders Garling J in Rees expressed the matter in this way at [50(5)]:

(5)In determining whether there has been a discrepancy of a kind sufficient to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance a court:

...

(iii)ought not intervene to reduce a sentence below a level, which would mean that the sentence would be wholly inadequate having regard to the offence involved and the criminality of the offender, and consequently the result would be an affront to the proper administration of justice: R v Chen [2002] NSWCCA 174; 130 A Crim R 300 at [289] per Heydon JA, Sully and Levine JJ; DGM at [58] per Latham J (McColl JA agreeing); Kelly at [12] per Johnson J (Simpson J agreeing); Green at [33] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.

33In Green v The Queen French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said at [33]:

There is a question whether a sentence which would otherwise be appropriate can be reduced on the ground of disparity to a level which, had there been no disparity, would be regarded as erroneously lenient. In Lowe that question was answered explicitly in the affirmative by Mason J [Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 613 and less explicitly but to like effect by Dawson J, with whom Wilson J agreed [at 623]. It has also been answered in the affirmative in a number of cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales [authorities omitted]. On the other hand, as Simpson J correctly pointed out in R v Steele [unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 17 April, 1997, at 8-11], the existence of a discretion, where unjustified disparity is shown, to reduce a co-offender's sentence to one which is inadequate does not amount to an obligation to do so. Certainly, the discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal to reduce a sentence to a less than adequate level would not require it to consider reducing the sentence to a level which would be, as Street CJ put it in R v Draper, ""an affront to the proper administration of justice.""[unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 12 December 1986, at 5] Moreover, if the relevant sentencing legislation, on its proper construction, does not permit an inadequate sentence to be imposed, there can be no discretion on appeal to impose one. Whether or not the discretion to reduce a sentence to an inadequate level is available, marked and unjustified disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentence appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences. 

34In considering both the Applicant's sentence and the co-offenders' sentences it is useful to examine a number of other cases involving the same offence. The Sentencing Judge considered four such cases. The Applicant submitted that one of those cases, Truong v R [2009] NSWCCA 41, was not significantly different from the present case in terms of criminality. 

35A brief summary of the cases follows.

(a) Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 322 

In this matter the Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of cultivating not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means. There were 105 plants involved. He also pleaded guilty to supplying cannabis in that he had in his possession 3708.7 grams of cannabis leaf. The maximum penalty for the first offence was 15 years imprisonment. His Honour considered that the offences fell within the middle range of seriousness. He allowed a 30% discount for the plea of guilty and for his remorse and contrition. It appears that he was the principal involved in the cultivation. In relation to the first count of cultivation he was sentenced to a total sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. An appeal to this Court was dismissed. 

(b) Thi Lan Nguyen v R [2009] NSWCCA 181

In this matter the Applicant pleaded guilty to cultivating not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means. The charge involved 172 cannabis plants. The maximum penalty for the offence is 15 years imprisonment. It was found that she agreed to look after the house where the plants were cultivated in return for financial gain and accommodation. There was no evidence to suggest that she initiated the cultivation. She was given a 25% discount for an early plea and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. An appeal to this Court reduced the sentence to a period of 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months.

(c) Van Cuong Pham v R [2009] NSWCCA 266

The Applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of cultivating by enhanced indoor means a commercial quantity of cannabis. There were 112 plants involved. The maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment. The Judge found that the Applicant's role in the commission of the offence was at a relatively low level, he having been recruited by other unidentified persons. In effect he acted as a ""babysitter"" for the crop in return for receiving something between $10,000 and $15,000. The Applicant was given a 25% discount for an early plea. He was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months. An appeal to this Court alleging that the sentence was manifestly excessive was dismissed.

(d)  Thi Don Truong v R [2009] NSWCCA 41

The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence of cultivating not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis. The maximum penalty was fifteen years imprisonment. There were 189 plants involved. The judge considered her criminality fell a little below the middle of the range. The applicant received a 25% discount for an early plea and was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months with an additional term of two years. On appeal to this court against the severity of the sentence it was held that even if she did not initiate the cultivation enterprise she took it over and maintained it for commercial gain. The appeal against severity was dismissed.

36A consideration of these cases suggests two things. First, the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was within the range of sentences to be found in those cases. No basis is shown for suggesting that Truong should be preferred. Secondly, the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders fell below the range of sentences in those cases. The decisions in Nguyen [2009] and Pham dealt with offenders who were not principals in the enterprise. Thos decisions suggest that the sentence given to the co-offenders was particularly lenient even bearing in mind the matters of hardship that impacted upon the co-offenders and that were taken into account by the Sentencing judge. 

37In the present matter the co-offenders were found to have been involved in a premeditated way for financial gain. His Honour likened their roles to those of the appellants in Nguyen [2009], Truong and Pham all of whom received higher sentences.
38That said, I take into account what Latham J (with whom Young JA and Hidden J agreed) said in Pham at [26]:

In my view, the three decisions of this court that deal directly with offences committed under the new penalty regime [ie Nguyen [2008], Nguyen [2009] and Truong] tend to establish that the applicant's sentence was well within range. Considerable caution ought to be exercised in reaching any conclusion that a given sentence is outside the appropriate range when so few prosecutions have been brought to the court's attention. The applicant bears the onus of satisfying the court that the sentence is not just severe, but that it is manifestly excessive. I am not so persuaded.

39This position remains the same. In my opinion the Applicant has not established that the sentence he received was manifestly excessive. Nor, considering the differences noted by the Judge in the respective roles of the offenders, the subjective matters peculiar to the co-offenders, and the leniency of the sentences given to the co-offenders, has the Applicant demonstrated that he has a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the disparity of the sentences imposed.

Conclusion

40I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

41GARLING J:I agree with Davies J.

2759097,Newman v R [2012] NSWCCA 69,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: In the early hours of 23 January 2010, the applicant, a co-offender (David Chatfield) and others were engaged in a fracas at the house in Bundy Street, Gilgandra, occupied by David Prout, his cousin Christopher Prout and Christopher's girlfriend.

2The first confrontation occurred on the front lawn of the house, apparently between the applicant and David Prout. Having been punched a number of times, Mr Prout retreated into the house, being followed by the applicant and co-accused, Chatfield. The reason for the original confrontation did not appear from the statement of agreed facts tendered at the sentencing of each of the offenders, nor from other material. The applicant was charged with common assault, based on the punches administered to David Prout outside the house. As indicated in more detail by Blanch J, both he and Mr Chatfield were charged with offences of demand money with menaces, in each case in company with the other, in respect of David and Christopher Prout respectively. Each faced a separate and more serious charge in respect of the events inside the house. In the case of the applicant, it was a charge of assault with intent to rob David Prout, using corporal violence, contrary to s 95(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). In the case of Mr Chatfield, it was an offence of robbery of Christopher Prout whilst armed with an offensive weapon, namely a glass bottle, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. The offence under s 95(1) carried the same maximum penalty (20 years imprisonment) as did s 97(1). Neither is subject to a standard non-parole period.

3A challenge based on disparity of sentences in the circumstances of this case gives rise to a number of difficulties for the applicant. First, in relation to the two offences with which he and Mr Chatfield were jointly charged, they received identical sentences. Secondly, he was charged with an additional offence, although the sentence for that offence was to be served entirely concurrently with one of the offences of demand money with menaces. Thirdly, the third and most serious offence in each case was not an offence committed jointly, nor was it a contravention of the same provision of the Crimes Act, but in fact each received the same sentence.

4There have, in past years, been doubts as to how precisely a principle of disparity might apply in such circumstances. When the principle, being ""a reflection of the notion of equal justice"", was articulated in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 610-611 (Mason J), it operated in respect of co-offenders jointly indicted for the one offence. That a reference to co-offenders was not so limited appeared from the later decision of the High Court in Jones v The Queen [1993] 67 ALJR 376. That case suggested that such a principle might operate in circumstances where one offender was charged with supplying a drug, the co-offender being a recipient. In OM v R [2009] NSWCCA 267 I referred to a number of other cases in which the concept of a 'co-offender' had been treated as extending beyond those jointly charged with the same offence:

""[10] ... In R v Armstrong [2001] NSWCCA 77, the language of disparity was used in relation to an applicant who was one of a number of ""runners"" employed by an organisation distributing drugs in the Kings Cross area. The Court did not intervene to reduce the applicant's sentence, but not because it concluded they were not co-offenders.

[11] In Stanton v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 326, the applicant was sentenced on a number of counts involving the supply of prohibited drugs. The question of parity arose in relation to another person sentenced in respect of what appear to have been similar drug offences arising out of the same 'controlled operation' conducted by police over a period of one month with respect to a motorcycle gang. The Court did not seek to identify whether the applicant and the co-offender were knowingly concerned in the same particular offences.

[12] It thus appears that the disparity principle operates with respect to persons who may not have committed the same offence, but have been involved in a course of criminal activity through some kind of association over a limited period of time. It would require a departure from that approach (for which the Director did not contend) to avoid the application of the principle in the present case.""

5The Court returned to the issue in Jimmy v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540. After an exhaustive review of the case law, Campbell JA concluded at [202]:

""As the facts of Sumner, Nguyen, Rend, Shen, OM and Melikian illustrate, unequal treatment that is so great as to bring about a justifiable sense of grievance can sometimes arise between participants in a common criminal enterprise who have committed different crimes. In my view there is no obstacle of the type the Crown submits to the parity principle being applied simply because a case is one in which the sentence by comparison with which the sentence under appeal is sought to be reduced was for a different crime.""

6The issue has been resolved by the High Court in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 86 ALJR 36. The offenders in that case had been participants in a common criminal enterprise involving the cultivation of a significant number of cannabis plants. The majority (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ), stated at [30]:

""In Lowe v The Queen and in Postiglione v The Queen, this Court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise. Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged. The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v The Queen, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.""

7There are factors in the present case which preclude intervention by this Court. The equality of the overall sentencing in each case, the equal sentences imposed in respect of the two joint offences, the equal sentences imposed in respect of the two most serious offences, combined with the fact that the sentencing judge dealt with each offender, fully conscious of the norm of equality, militate against such intervention. In effect, the applicant must establish that he was entitled to a lesser sentence than Mr Chatfield, despite the fact that he was the instigator of the fracas (so far as appears from the statement of agreed facts) and despite the fact that he was charged with an additional offence, albeit the least serious of the four counts. The only factors militating clearly in favour of a lesser sentence in his case are the greater criminal record of Mr Chatfield and some personal circumstances of the applicant, to which Blanch J refers below. They do not, however, give rise to the justifiable sense of grievance required for intervention on this ground.

8The second ground asserted that the sentencing of the applicant resulted in a manifestly excessive sentence in respect of the offence under s 95, or an excessive period of imprisonment due to the degree of accumulation. For reasons explained by Blanch J, the submission should be accepted, on the limited basis that the extent of the accumulation of sentences was inappropriate in the circumstances. The fact that the sentencing judge considered it appropriate to make the charge relating to the assault which occurred on the front lawn wholly concurrent with the first of the three counts arising from the conduct inside the house demonstrates that he approach the matter as involving one episode of criminality. Consistently, the conduct inside the house warranted a degree of accumulation of sentences, but not to the extent of 12 months, given the overall minimum period of imprisonment. I agree with the orders proposed by Blanch J.

9BLANCH J: The applicant appeals against sentences imposed at Dubbo District Court by Acting Judge Woods on 20 December 2010. The applicant entered pleas of guilty to the following four counts:

Count 1: Common assault on David Prout contrary to s61 Crimes Act 1900 which has a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment;

Count 2: Assault with intent to rob David Prout contrary to s95(1) Crimes Act 1900 which has a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment;

Count 3: Demand money with menaces from David Prout contrary to s99(2) Crimes Act 1900 which has a maximum penalty of 14 years;

Count 4: A further count of demand money with menaces from Christopher Prout.

10The applicant was sentenced as follows:

As to count 1: A fixed term of nine months imprisonment from 28 January 2010;

As to count 3: A total term of 18 months with a 12 month non-parole period also to date from 28 January 2010;

As to count 4: A total term of 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 28 July 2010;

As to count 2: A total term of four years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and nine months to date from 28 January 2011. 

The total sentence was consequently a sentence of five years and six months with a non-parole period of three years and nine months.

11The application for leave to appeal against sentence asserts firstly that there is a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity in the sentence the applicant received and the sentence received by a co-offender Chatfield. It is secondly asserted the sentence was manifestly excessive.

12The sentencing judge summarised the facts as being that the victim David Prout lived with his cousin in Bundy Street, Gilgandra. He came home in the early hours of the morning and was sitting on his front lawn. He heard a group of people coming down the street and recognising one, he called out to say hello. He became aware of some of these people approaching him and the applicant came up and punched him a number of times. A co-offender Carr also punched the victim twice to the face. The victim went into the house and called for help from his cousin Christopher Prout but the applicant and the co-offender went into the house. 

13Inside the house the co-offender Chatfield made threats to hit the victim with a bottle. At one stage the applicant while punching the victim to the face said ""Where's your money, give us your wallet."" The co-offender went out with one of the victims and they got some money. In the meantime the applicant was still demanding money from David's wallet and asking for his wallet while punching him. The applicant demanded money from both victims and threw more punches. 

14Christopher Prout's girlfriend was able to dial 000 and the applicant and co-offender left. As a result of the assault Christopher Prout sustained a cut to the inside of his lip. David Prout was treated at the hospital for superficial grazing, a swollen face and some lacerations. 

15The pre-sentence report in respect of the applicant indicates that he had consumed two cartons of beer and intravenously injected fifty dollars worth of amphetamine prior to the commission of the offences. The report also confirms his long history of abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs. 

16The first ground of appeal is that ""he has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity between the sentence he received for the offence under s95(1) and the sentence received by Chatfield for the offence under s97.""

17The co-offender Chatfield was sentenced in respect of the two demand money with menaces charges and a charge of armed robbery arising out of the same incident. He was not charged with common assault. He was sentenced to a total sentence of five years with a non-parole period of three years and nine months but that sentence was to date from 7 July 2010. He had, in fact, been in custody since 4 February 2010 having had his parole revoked. At the time of these offences he had breached his parole, it had been revoked and a warrant had been issued for his arrest. Accordingly, the sentence for these offences was largely cumulative on the revocation of his parole.

18In considering the question of disparity in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301 in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ it was said:
""However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen, recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to 'a justifiable sense of grievance'.""

19At page 309 McHugh J said:
""If a judge wrongly fails to give effect to the parity principle, an appellate court will intervene to correct what is an error in sentencing principle. In Lowe v The Queen, Gibbs CJ, with whom Wilson J agreed, said that an appellate court should intervene where 'the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done'. Mason J stated that an appellate court is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance. Dawson J, with whom Wilson J also agreed, was of the view that '[t]he difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive and call for the intervention of an appellate court in the interests of justice'.""

20At page 323 Gummow J said:
""The principle for which Lowe is authority appears to be that the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes where the difference between the two sentences is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done.

In R v Taudevin (1996) 2 VR 402 at 404, Callaway JA said, in a passage with which I agree:

'The important words are 'manifestly', 'justifiable' and 'objective'. There is much to be said for the view that all three requirements are variations on the same theme, ie that only a manifest discrepancy in the sense of a difference that is clearly excessive will satisfy the other two requirements.""

21And at page 335 Kirby J said:

""The removal of serious and unjustifiable disparities in the treatment of like cases is a legitimate goal of the administration of criminal justice.""

22It is evident from these authorities that a simple disparity is not enough and in order to attract appellate intervention it must be categorised as a manifest discrepancy in the sense of a difference that is clearly excessive. Moreover, in R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247, it was said this Court would reserve a discretion not to intervene or intervene to only a limited degree where it is apparent that the sentence under comparison was unjustifiably lenient - see also Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 at 33.

23In considering the respective cases of Chatfield and the applicant, it is noted that at the time of the offence Chatfield was 23 and the applicant was 24 years of age. Chatfield had a much more significant criminal history involving a number of charges of dishonesty and assault. On 29 July 2009 at Dubbo District Court a sentence of 16 months and six days with a non-parole period of ten months and four days from 13 January 2009 was confirmed on an appeal from the Local Court. On 18 December 2009 his parole was revoked and a warrant issued for his arrest which was executed on 4 February 2010. In his case the pre-sentence report said that his behaviour in custody was consistently poor and disruptive and he had been abusive to staff and tested positive to drugs. In his case the report is very pessimistic as to his prospects of rehabilitation.

24By comparison although the applicant has a criminal history, it is not as significant as that of Chatfield. The pre-sentence report noted he had formed a new relationship and a daughter was born shortly after his arrest. The report says that because of this relationship there may be some impetus for change, particularly in relation to his abuse of alcohol and drugs.

25In considering the question of disparity the sentencing judge correctly identified the applicant as the person who initiated an assault on one of the victims and who went into the house accompanied by the co-offender who at one stage sought to restrain the applicant. The co-offender was not charged with common assault and of his three offences one was armed robbery rather than assault with intent to rob. His total sentence was the same as that of the applicant, the difference being that Chatfield's sentence was cumulative on the balance of his parole.

26Bearing in mind the subjective and objective features of the case, I cannot conclude that any disparity was manifest. Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails.

27The second ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive and this ground has been argued together with another ground of appeal added by leave asserting that the accumulation of the sentences has led to a total sentence which is excessive.

28In considering these grounds, it is noteworthy that all offences were committed as part of the one escapade when the applicant was well-affected by intoxicating liquor. Moreover, there is a clear distinction in the subjective cases of the two offenders relating to their criminal histories and prospects of rehabilitation. Although not giving rise to a disparity, these different circumstances might be expected to give rise to some reduction in the sentence of the applicant and I believe some reduction is justified.

29The applicant has submitted an affidavit indicating he has enrolled in courses while in gaol addressing his emotional behaviour and drug use. He has worked for five months packaging dog food and he intends to join his partner and daughter in Forster on release and obtain work in carpentry. 

30I do not believe the individual sentences are in themselves manifestly excessive. It is rather the accumulation of the sentences that causes the overall sentence in the applicant's case to be excessive. To achieve an appropriate total sentence, I propose the following orders:

(1) Grant leave to appeal.

(2) Allow the appeal to the extent that the sentence on count 2 of a non-parole period of two years and nine months with a balance of term of one year and nine months should commence on 28 July 2010.

(3) In consequence he will be eligible for parole on 27 April 2013 and the total sentence will expire on 27 January 2015.

31BEECH-JONES J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Blanch J. Subject to one brief comment, I agree with His Honour's reasons. All of the applicant's offences were committed within a relatively short space of time and were part of the same drunken drug fuelled incident. In my view the basis for intervention in respect of the accumulation of the sentence imposed on him for the offence under s95 of the Crimes Act 1900 was the a failure of the sentencing judge to give proper weight to the totality principle when fixing the start date for that offence (Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ at 624, [45]).

32I agree with the orders proposed by Blanch J.

		23 April 2012",2012-04-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759098,Cassidy v R [2012] NSWCCA 68,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: This application provides another example of the difficulties which can arise in applying the principles articulated by the High Court in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383. The relevant principle, as explained by Gibbs CJ (with the agreement of Mason and Murphy JJ) is that a sentencing judge cannot take into account a factor which would constitute an element of a more serious offence than the one with which the offender was charged and of which he was convicted, or to which he has pleaded guilty: at 389. That principle, derived from provisions of the Criminal Code (WA), was said to find support in the general law (as discussed at pp 389-391) and has been consistently applied on that basis in this State. That principle continues to be applied, despite the statutory obligation to take into account aggravating factors which do not constitute elements of the offence: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), s 21A(2). The justification for that course is the countervailing obligation not to have regard to any aggravating factor if to do so would be contrary to any rule of law, statutory or otherwise: s 21A(4).

2The difficulties which can arise in the application of the De Simoni principle have been discussed on a number of occasions in this Court and need not be revisited here: see McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; 194 A Crim R 439 at [38]-[39] (Howie J, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing); Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38 at [46]-[54] (McClellan CJ at CL) and [60]-[72] (RA Hulme J) and Einfeld v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 at [135]-[138].

3A particular difficulty arises in the circumstance (not uncommon) in which the conduct which constitutes an element of the offence charged also constitutes an element of a more serious offence. Thus, in De Simoni, the relevant element of the offence was committing a robbery ""with actual violence"". The violence was constituted by a blow to the back of the head of the victim, which inflicted a wound to the scalp. The Court held that the blow could be taken into account, but not its consequence, to the extent that it involved wounding, because there was a further offence, with a greater punishment, involving the element of wounding, with which the offender was not charged. As explained by Brennan J (in dissent) at 403:

""To omit consideration of the personal violence done to Mrs Scott is to omit consideration of conduct constituting an essential element of the offence to which the respondent had pleaded guilty. The prosecutor's statement of facts did not disclose any use of actual violence or any threat to use actual violence to Mrs Scott other than the blow upon her head .... It was accepted that ... the hitting of Mrs Scott was thus the only actual violence to which that allegation in the indictment related.""

4The difficulty in the present case is related, though not identical. The charge under s 198 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) involved the separate allegations that the applicant ""intentionally destroyed a number of motor vehicles and a dwelling house"", with the further intent ""by that destruction to endanger the life of Mr Genetzakis [the victim]"". No doubt the circumstances of the fire and its consequences, set out by Blanch J below, might have been sufficient to demonstrate the necessary intent to endanger life; however, the prosecution was entitled to rely, as it did, upon statements made by the applicant (as set out in a statement of facts, accepted by the applicant for the purposes of the sentencing). Accordingly, his Honour was entitled to rely upon that material in describing the conduct constituting the elements of the charge. The aspect which called for caution on the part of the sentencing judge was the element of those statements in which the offender appeared to reveal an intention to kill, rather than merely endanger life. The sentencing judge was not required to ignore that evidence, but he was required to exercise care in taking it into account. It appears that the evidence was taken into account in two ways, namely as material demonstrating a lack of remorse on the part of the applicant and, secondly, as material relevant to the seriousness of the offending conduct. 

5During an exchange of abuse with the applicant earlier in the evening preceding the offence, the victim identified a number of premises as being occupied by drug dealers and junkies. Ms Gail Harris who, like the applicant's mother, lived at one of the addresses identified by the victim gave a statement to police which was dealt with by the sentencing judge in the following terms in the judgment on sentence at pp 4-6:

""Ms Gail Harris also spoke to the police about the offender's movements[:] she heard the offender say, about Mr Genigzakis [sic], 'I'm fuckin' sick of the way he talks to the women in this street. He needs a good bashing.'

It was clear that Ms Harris had her suspicions that the offender was responsible for the fire because as soon as she saw him the following morning she said to him, 'What the fuck have you done, Sean?' to which the offender replied, 'I didn't do a good enough job, they're still alive. They shouldn't have been able to get out of the house if the fire had spread like it was supposed to.'

This expression of a complete absence of remorse on the part of the offender has continued. ...

I am satisfied, however, that what the offender meant to convey by those words is that he is sorry for his family, for what he has done to them. ... To his Auntie Gail he said, 'I should have killed him when I had the chance.' He wanted to teach the offender a lesson because of what he did to his family.

The seriousness of the offender's misconduct is obvious. He deliberately placed the bomb in a position where it was next to an LPG fuel tank. It was his intention that the fire would spread in such a way that the people inside the house would not get out alive and even to this day it seems he wishes that he had succeeded. Such criminality, as is obvious, requires harsh, perhaps even a draconian sentence.

[Counsel for the offender] called no evidence, nor did he tender any documents .... 

...
[Counsel for the offender] submitted that the offender's motivation was a misplaced sense of grievance. That seems to be the case. ...

Nor was this a spur of the moment decision. The offender would have taken some time to assemble the materials to produce what he described as 'the napalm bomb', all the while having the capacity to reflect on what he was doing. I state the obvious here but it is one thing to destroy the property of someone you are upset with but to want them dead and to set about achieving that is a completely different matter altogether.""

6To the extent that the sentencing judge took the statements of intention into account in assessing whether the applicant was entitled to the benefit of a finding of remorse, there was no error. However, to the extent that he took into account an intention to kill in assessing the seriousness of the applicant's conduct, he would appear to have contravened the principle identified in De Simoni. Such an intention would have warranted a charge of attempt to murder, pursuant to ss 28-30 of the Crimes Act. Those, the applicant contended, were more serious offences, with which he had not been charged and to which he had not pleaded. In response, the Director contended that they are different offences, but they are not more serious for the purpose of the De Simoni principle, because they carry the same maximum penalty, namely imprisonment for 25 years.

7In my view that response should be rejected for two reasons. First, as explained by Blanch J, the fact that each of ss 28-30 of the Crimes Act is subject to a standard non-parole period of 10 years, whereas there is no standard non-parole period for s 198, demonstrates that those offences are treated by the legislature as more serious: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 54A and Table to Part 4, Div 1A. Secondly, despite carrying a liability to the same maximum penalty, in terms of moral culpability, an intention to kill is more serious than an intention to endanger life. Accordingly, the former intent would warrant a more severe sentence than the latter.

8Further, the reasoning set out above reveals an important respect in which an offender may be sentenced improperly, absent express identification of the relevant elements of the offence. Apart from the objective circumstances involving the ""napalm bomb"" the statements by the applicant to the effect that the occupants of the house should not have survived and that he wished they had not, did not necessarily demonstrate that he had an intention to kill the occupants at the time of the offence. Nor was such an intention admitted, either by the plea or by acceptance of the statement of facts. It required a finding beyond reasonable doubt on the part of the sentencing judge. There was no express finding to that effect. Had the issue of whether the applicant in fact had an intent to kill at the time of the offence been expressly addressed, it would have been necessary to decide whether the statements did accurately reflect the intention of the applicant at the time of the offence. That exercise would, in all probability, have alerted the sentencing judge to the fact that he was considering an element of a different and more serious offence, which had not been charged.

9In these circumstances I agree with the orders proposed by Blanch J and with his reasons.

10BLANCH J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Berman SC at East Maitland District Court on 22 April 2010. On that day the applicant entered a plea of guilty to intentionally destroying property with intent to endanger life. That offence was committed on 16 September 2009. It is an offence contrary to s198 Crimes Act 1900. It has a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and there is no standard non-parole period. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment of 14 years to commence on 30 September 2009 and to expire on 29 September 2023 and a non-parole period of ten years and six months was imposed to expire on 29 March 2020.

11The facts as summarised by the judge were that there was a neighbourhood dispute involving the victim Mr Genigzakis and a number of other people in the area. On the evening of 16 September 2009 the victim and his partner were at home watching television when they heard a noise outside which sounded as though someone was opening and closing the doors of unregistered vehicles the victim had on his property. The victim went outside and saw a number of young people and there was a verbal altercation between the victim and those young people. It does not appear the applicant was amongst those young people but he learned about the altercation and during the course of the altercation, the victim accused a number of people in the neighbourhood of dealing in drugs and at one stage said ""Everyone in the neighbourhood knows you're fucking drug dealers. Everyone knows that 13 and 17 Brown Street and 19 Burnett Street and the people in McKellar Street are nothing but fucking drug dealers and junkies. Your four houses have held the whole community to ransom."" At that stage one of the men called out ""We are going to burn your fucking house down"" and that led to the Police being called. The Police attended but after speaking to various people they left the area as things seemed to calm down.

12The victim went back inside and was watching television and fell asleep in the lounge room. His partner went to bed in the second storey of the house. Just after midnight the victim was woken by the sound of windows smashing and flames going through the lounge room windows. He saw the lounge room roof was about to collapse. His partner was also woken by the noise and they both ran out of the house past some of the cars parked outside. As they got near one of them, an LPG powered vehicle, the gas cylinder exploded throwing the victim about ten metres. He saw a wall of fire engulfing both his cars and his home.

13Inquiries pointed to the source of the fire being near the right hand side of the motor vehicle which had exploded. The explosion was so forceful that parts of the car were thrown 50 metres away. The victim suffered the loss of his home and four of his vehicles, the financial loss being in excess of half a million dollars. 

14The first ground of appeal is ""the learned sentencing judge contravened the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383; by sentencing the applicant on the basis that he had an intention that ""the people inside the house would not get out alive"".""

15This ground of appeal refers to the statement of principle by Gibbs CJ at page 389 of De Simoni:

""... the general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, that no one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted. The combined effect of the two principles, so far as it is relevant for present purposes, is that a judge, in imposing sentence, is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence"".

16The assertion here is that the sentencing judge was, in fact, sentencing for an offence of attempted murder contrary to either s27, 28, 29 or 30 Crimes Act 1900, any of which offences carries a maximum penalty of 25 years but all of them have a standard non-parole period of ten years pursuant to the Table of standard non-parole periods set out in Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

17There are two passages in the ex tempore judgment on sentence of the sentencing judge which might give rise to that interpretation. The first is a statement by his Honour:

""The seriousness of the offender's conduct is obvious. He deliberately placed the bomb in a position where it was next to an LPG fuel tank. It was his intention that the fire would spread in such a way that the people inside the house would not get out alive and even to this day it seems he wishes that he had succeeded. Such criminality, as is obvious, requires harsh, perhaps even a draconian sentence.""

18In a second passage in the judgment on sentence his Honour said:

""I state the obvious here but it is one thing to destroy the property of someone you are upset with but to want them dead and to set about achieving that is a completely different matter altogether.""

19In the remarks on sentence his Honour referred to an intercepted telephone call where the applicant spoke about placing a napalm bomb in the rear seat of a car next to a gas cylinder and setting fire to it and his Honour concluded that the explosion of the gas cylinder was an unintended consequence. His Honour also referred to the evidence that a neighbour had said to the applicant next morning ""What the fuck have you done Sean?"" to which the applicant replied ""I didn't do a good enough job. They're still alive. They shouldn't have been able to get out of the house if the fire had spread like it was supposed to.""

20In dealing with that statement his Honour was clearly dealing with the question of whether or not the applicant had demonstrated remorse for his actions and he concluded that:

""There is no evidence before me that he is in the slightest way sorry for having risked the lives of Mr Genigzakis or his partner and indeed the only evidence before me suggests that he remains disappointed that they are still alive.""

21In my view his Honour was justified on the facts of the case in coming to that conclusion about the lack of remorse shown by the applicant. He was bound to consider the issue of remorse in accordance with the accepted sentencing principles and in considering that issue he was entitled to take into account all of the evidence. The question is whether his Honour impermissibly took into account an intention to kill in sentencing for an offence where the assertion was an intention to endanger life. 

22In my view the first two passages I have quoted from his Honour's remarks indicate that his Honour was, in fact, taking into account an intention to kill as part of ""the seriousness of the offender's misconduct..."". The second passage quoted above reinforces this was his Honour's intention in imposing the sentence.

23The Crown points out that the maximum penalty for the s198 offence to which the applicant entered a plea is the same maximum penalty as provided in ss27 to 30. On that basis the Crown argues that his Honour did not infringe the principle in De Simoni because the ss27 to 30 offences are not ""more serious"" offences.

24In my view that submission by the Crown fails to take account of the impact of standard non-parole periods. In Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154 the High Court said at [25]:

""The court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the midrange of objective seriousness.""

25The Court further went on to say at [27] that in imposing the sentence the sentencing court will be ""... mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period."" The High Court observed at [31]:

""It may be, as the Court of Criminal Appeal observed in Way, that for some Div 1A offences there will be a move upwards in the length of the non-parole period as a result of the introduction of the standard non-parole period. This is the likely outcome of adding the court's awareness of the standard non-parole period to the various considerations bearing on the determination of the appropriate sentence."" 

26In those circumstances in my view the offences under ss27 to 30 which require an intent to kill and which have standard non-parole periods, are ""more serious"" within the meaning of that term in De Simoni. Accordingly, the challenge made to the sentence imposed here has been made out. 

27The question then remains as to whether a less severe sentence is warranted in law. The applicant was born on 19 October 1985 and he was 23 years of age at the time of the offence. He has a criminal history that began in July 2000 when he was 14 years of age. He has been dealt with in the Children's Court on a number of occasions and in 2008 he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. That sentence expired in its entirety on 16 July 2009 shortly before the commission of this offence.

28The sentencing judge quite correctly determined there was no indication of remorse by the applicant. His criminal history can only lead to the conclusion that his prospects of rehabilitation are not significant, although an assessment is difficult in a case such as this where a significant gaol term must be imposed. I also agree with the assessment of the sentencing judge that the offence is a serious one, even leaving aside any finding of intention to kill. I also agree with the sentencing judge that the applicant is entitled to a full 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty.

29Taking those matters into account, I believe the appropriate sentence is one of nine years non-parole period with a balance of term of three years.

30I propose the following orders:

(1) Grant leave to appeal against the sentence.

(2) Quash the sentence and non-parole period imposed in the District Court.

(3) Sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of nine years with a balance of term of three years to date from 30 September 2009.

(4) He will be eligible for release to parole on 29 September 2018.

31BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Blanch J.

		23 April 2012",2012-04-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759101,R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: On 14 December 2010 the respondent was sentenced by Delaney DCJ in the District Court at Parramatta for three offences as follows:

(a) possessing a prohibited pistol, contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) - non-parole period of nine months to date from 30 July 2009, expiring on 29 April 2010, with a balance of term of nine months expiring on 29 January 2011 (count 3);
(b) sell prohibited firearm to a person not authorised to possess the firearm, contrary to s 51 of the Firearms Act - a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment to date from 30 December 2009 and to expire on 29 June 2011 (count 2), and
(c) conspiracy to manufacture a prohibited drug (amphetamine) in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity, contrary to s 26 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) - a non-parole period of two years, six months to date from 30 March 2010, expiring on 29 September 2012, with a balance of term of one year, six months expiring on 29 March 2014 (count 1).

Procedure on appeal 
2On 30 December 2010 the Director gave notice of his intention to appeal on the ground that ""the sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate"". The notice referred to each of the three offences, but the ground was imprecise as to which sentence, or what aspect of the sentencing, was sought to be challenged.

3On 17 March 2011 the Director gave notice of ""additional grounds of appeal"", which were as follows:

""1. His Honour erred in commencing the sentence on 30 July 2009, the date of the respondent's arrest.
2. His Honour erred in determining the fact that the offending behaviour involved communication with an undercover officer or gaol informant as a factor which considerably reduced the objectivity [sic] gravity of the criminality.
3. His Honour erred in determining a starting point of 8 years for the offence of conspiring to manufacture a prohibited drug (large commercial quantity).
4. His Honour erred in double counting subjective factors.
5. The sentencing judge erred in failing to nominate the percentage discount for future assistance.
6. His Honour erred in imposing a lesser for count 3 than the sentence for count 2.
7. His Honour erred in failing to properly accumulate the sentences to reflect the principle of totality.""

4On the same day the Director filed written submissions in support of the appeal, which was listed for hearing on 19 April 2011. The respondent filed written submissions on 15 April 2011.

5Three procedural matters arose at the hearing. First, at the outset, counsel for the Director withdrew a submission that ""the sentences individually and collectively are manifestly inadequate"" and instead submitted that ""[t]he sentence for the conspiracy offence is manifestly inadequate as is the total sentence"": Tcpt, 19/04/11, p 1(35).

6Secondly, upon it becoming apparent during the course of argument that there was no material before the Court from which to derive a permissible range of sentencing for the offence of conspiracy, the Director sought leave to file a schedule dealing with cases involving manufacture of commercial or large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs to assist in demonstrating that the sentence imposed was outside the established range: Tcpt, p 6(45)-(50).

7Thirdly, the respondent read an affidavit setting out the circumstances of his imprisonment which he described as being subject to a ""strict-strict protective custody"" regime. No objection was taken to that affidavit, nor was the respondent required for cross-examination. It may be assumed that the purpose of the evidence was not to demonstrate error on the part of the sentencing judge, but to provide a reason why the Court should not intervene if it were otherwise minded to do so. On completion of the hearing, the Court reserved its decision. 

8On 4 May 2011 the Director filed (and served) a schedule of cases decided in this Court involving offences of conspiracy to manufacture large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs (other than cannabis leaf) and manufacturing such drugs. A similar schedule with respect to supply of such drugs, and statistics from the Judicial Commission in respect of those offences. On 11 May 2011 counsel for the respondent filed a submission in reply. 

9Although the Director had approached the Court on the basis that the sentence for the principal offence was manifestly inadequate, on reviewing the material it became apparent to the Court that critical to an assessment of the sentencing of this offender was a proper understanding of the discount which had been accorded for assistance to the authorities and, in particular, how that discount related to matters for which the respondent had previously been sentenced. It may be that the Court should, at that point, have determined that it was not in a position to uphold the appeal and dismissed it in the exercise of its discretion. (That was a possibility which was foreshadowed in the course of oral argument on 19 April, when it became clear that the Director was not in a position to demonstrate the range of sentences for the principal offending.) Nevertheless, that course was not taken. On 14 September 2011, the Registrar, at the request of the Court, wrote to the Director seeking further information.

10On 25 October 2011 the Registrar received a response from the Director enclosing a supplementary submission (dated 19 October), together with four attachments and two affidavits of Ms Catherine Anne Williams, a solicitor in the Office of the Director, sworn on 19 and 25 October 2011 respectively.

11The affidavit of 19 October provided information in relation to some of the matters in respect of which the respondent had provided assistance, which had reached the stage of plea or conviction since the hearing of the appeal in the present matter. The second affidavit (of 25 October) conveyed information provided by the Department of Corrective Services on that day, responding to the affidavit of the respondent of 14 April 2011.

12The point has now been reached where the respondent, having been sentenced to a period of three years and two months mandatory custody, is now within six months of completing that sentence. A significant part of the elapsed period is a consequence of the sentence being backdated to commence more than 16 months before the date of judgment. However, the further lapse of time, in the context of the period of mandatory custody imposed, gives rise to a serious concern as to the proper order now to be made by this Court.

13It is convenient to refer in this context to the affidavit of 25 October 2011 by which the Director sought to contradict the respondent's evidence as to the circumstances of his incarceration. Reliance on that evidence was presumably based on the view that the Court can no longer assume that conditions of incarceration will be harsher for persons who have assisted authorities and are therefore on protection.

14In Regina v Joseph Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; 172 A Crim R 151, Howie J commented (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL) that it was necessary for courts to ""acknowledge the reality of the situation"" in respect of giving assistance to authorities which was, his Honour stated, that the provision of such assistance would ""not necessarily"" mean that the offender will be ""disadvantaged in the prison system"": at [5]. He suggested that the onus was on the offender who wished to assert otherwise to prove it by evidence. Although his Honour no doubt spoke from experience with many cases, the only authority expressly relied on was the judgment in R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97; 145 A Crim R 304. 

15In Mostyn, his Honour had undertaken a more nuanced approach, noting the ""conundrum"" that required the court sentencing an offender to make some predictions as to the circumstances of his or her custody, without information as to the most likely administrative arrangements for the prisoner, nor as to the time for which they might prevail: at [179]-[181]. These statements were cited with approval in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [177]. The remarks in Sukkar appear to require the courts to assume there will be no deprivation, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. However, in relation to future administrative actions of the custodial authorities, it is difficult to know what information an offender could usefully give, confident that it would apply after the sentencing. Arguably, the obligation of the Director to lend every assistance should apply in this, as in other respects, in relation to the consequences of the assistance: cf R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 254B (Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ). It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the evidence of the respondent as to his actual circumstances of incarceration suggested a significant level of deprivation since he was sentenced.

16Nevertheless, the affidavit of 25 October 2011 prepared for the Director should not have been proffered. He did not have leave to take such a step; he had not sought to cross-examine the respondent on his affidavit when the occasion arose at the oral hearing of the appeal; he had not sought to challenge that evidence in any other way at the hearing; the respondent is not in a position to challenge the deponent or the source of her information. The affidavit should be rejected.

Principles governing prosecution appeals on sentence
17The right of the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal against a sentence is long-standing: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5D, introduced by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1924 (NSW). Although, in contrast to some other jurisdictions, there is no requirement for leave, the power of the Court to vary the sentence is discretionary and there are a range of circumstances which would warrant a refusal to intervene, even where error is established. Principles governing the proper approach where leave to appeal was required were enunciated in Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295. 

18Everett involved the application of s 401(2) of the Criminal Code (Tas), as then in force, which allowed the Attorney General to appeal against an inadequate sentence only with leave of the Court. The sentence of imprisonment imposed at trial had been suspended when, it was submitted, full time custody was required. The prosecutor appearing at the sentencing hearing had not suggested that a suspended sentence would be inappropriate when such a course was proposed by the sentencing judge. The High Court held that, the failure of the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal to give proper weight to that omission was a factor militating against a grant of leave to appeal: at 303 (Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ). The joint judgment also referred to the significance of the fact that the application was made by the Attorney General, noting that ""the deep-rooted notions of fairness which underlie the common law principle against double jeopardy require that a court of criminal appeal approach an application by the Crown for leave to appeal against sentence on the basis that such leave should only be granted in the rare and exceptional case"": at 305. They also noted that such considerations were accentuated where each offender had, pursuant to the orders of the sentencing judge, ""been released from custody and had been permitted and encouraged to resume his place in the community and to set out on the path of rehabilitation"": ibid. 

19McHugh J wrote separately, noting the justification for such an appeal (at 306):

""The jurisdiction to hear a Crown appeal against sentence is conferred on a court of criminal appeal so that that court can ensure that, so far as the subject matter permits, there will be uniformity of sentencing. Uniformity of sentencing is a matter of great importance in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice in any jurisdiction. Sentences that are higher than usual create justifiable grievances in those who receive them. But inadequate sentences also give rise to a sense of injustice, not only in those who are the victims of the crimes in question but also in the general public. Inadequate sentences are also likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the courts to play their part in deterring the commission of crimes. To permit the Crown, as well as convicted persons, to appeal against sentences assists in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice.""

20His Honour further held that it is only where the court is ""convinced that the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range that it is ever justified in granting leave to the Crown to appeal"".

21The rationale relied on in Everett for treating intervention as exceptional is, since 2009, qualified by s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW):

""68A Double jeopardy not to be taken into account in prosecution appeals against sentence

(1) An appeal court must not: 

(a) dismiss a prosecution appeal against sentence, or
(b) impose a less severe sentence on any such appeal than the court would otherwise consider appropriate,

because of any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again.

(2) This section extends to an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and accordingly a reference in this section to an appeal court includes a reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal.""

22The operation of s 68A was addressed by this Court in R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7. The Court held that the purpose of s 68A was to exclude from consideration ""only the distress and anxiety of facing sentence a second time"", being ""the additional distress and anxiety caused by the possibility of a harsher sentence on appeal"": at [51] (Spigelman CJ; Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ agreeing). Further, the Court accepted that statements to the effect that prosecution appeals against sentence should be ""rare"" could no longer affect the exercise by the Court of its discretionary power to intervene: [124].

23The High Court returned to consider the principles to be applied in considering an appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 283 ALR 1. The judgment of the majority in Green (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) affirmed that the primary purpose of prosecution appeals against sentence is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"": at [1]. The judgment continued:

""That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the 'residual discretion'.""

24Their Honours also noted that the ""characterisation of Crown appeals as 'exceptional' has rested in part upon long-standing judicial concern about exposing sentenced persons to double jeopardy"", a concern which ""must now yield to the operation of s 68A"": at [25]. While that provision was said to be ""relevant to the exercise and scope of the residual discretion"", it did not extinguish the discretion: at [26]. Although the sentences considered in Green were held to be manifestly inadequate, a primary reason for not intervening, in the view of Allsop P and McCallum J in this Court (in dissent) (R v Green and Quin [2011] NSWCCA 71) and in the view of the majority in the High Court, was that intervention would create disparity with the sentences of co-offenders. The joint judgment in the High Court continued at [43]:

""Other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown appeal is allowed. They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation. They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. The guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual.""

25Bell J (in dissent) with whom Heydon J relevantly agreed, stated at [131]:

""The delay in the appellate process was not due to neglect by the Crown. The appellants applied for, and the Crown opposed, the adjournment of the appeals. Nonetheless, the appellants' progress to reform and the closeness to the date of their eligibility for parole were matters that the Court of Criminal Appeal was entitled to take into account as reasons for dismissing the appeals in the exercise of the residual discretion.""

26Concerns as to the extended period of a prosecution appeal against sentence, where the initial hearing did not canvas relevant material, also arose in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 243 FLR 28; 205 A Crim R 1. I expressed my concern as to the procedural course followed in that case at [73]-[74]:

""[73] ... the case as originally presented by the Director was deficient and failed to establish manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed on the respondent. The appeal should have been dismissed on that basis. Instead, the Court undertook its own research in order to satisfy itself as to the range of sentences applied nationally in respect of the offence for which the respondent was convicted, viewed in the context of other related offences. It was then necessary, as a matter of procedural fairness, to accord both parties the opportunity to comment on the results of that research. In my view, that course was inappropriate and demonstrated a departure from established practice in relation to the proper role of an intermediate criminal appeal court.

[74] It is undeniable that the equal administration of justice requires consistency in sentencing .... On the other hand, equality of treatment is an ideal not readily translated into exact application. Further, equality of outcome should not be pursued at the expense of procedural fairness to the individual offender.""

27These concerns are relevant in this case. However, except in the clearest cases of unfairness it will generally be necessary to weigh the extent and nature of any error established against any relevant delay. It is therefore necessary first to address the grounds raised by the Director, to determine whether inadequacy is established and, if so, the egregiousness of the departure from the appropriate range.

Grounds of appeal
(a) ground 6: pistol and revolver offences
28It is convenient to address ground 6 first. With the exception of ground 7, dealing with the degree of accumulation, all other grounds related to the sentence for the conspiracy charge (count 1).

29Counts 2 and 3 involved a .44-40 Winchester calibre six chamber revolving cylinder shortened rifle. Count 3 alleged possession of the gun without a licence; count 2 alleged selling a prohibited firearm to an unauthorised user. The gun was recovered from bushland in Queensland with a second revolver, which appears to have been the subject of charges of possessing and selling an unregistered firearm, to be taken into account on a Form 1. (It was possible, the matter not being clarified in this Court, that all charges related to the same gun.) On count 3, the sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of nine months, with a balance of term of nine months, giving a total term of imprisonment of 18 months. On count 2, the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months. The ground of appeal was that his Honour imposed a lesser sentence for count 3 than the sentence for count 2. The written submissions for the Director suggested that both sentences were manifestly inadequate, but that was not a ground of appeal. The basis for the complaint appears to have been that count 2 carried a maximum penalty of five years, whilst count 3 carried a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of three years. Those facts were said ""logically"" to suggest that there was some error in the sentencing process. Nevertheless, the Director's submissions stated that ""[a]rguably both offences are of equal gravity"": written submissions, par 62.

30It is apparent from the judgment on sentence (pp 12-13) that his Honour intended to sentence on each count by adopting a starting point, before discounts, of three years imprisonment. The discount resulted in a sentence of 18 months in each case. The reason for imposing a non-parole period and a balance of term with respect to count 3, but a fixed term with respect to count 2, is obscure. However, the swapping of the sentences does not, by itself, warrant the intervention of this Court. Ground 6 should be rejected. 

(b) grounds 1 and 7 - accumulation
31Whilst the respondent was in custody serving a sentence for offences of a similar kind, he met a man named ""George"". The agreed facts stated that:

""The two discussed the manufacture of methylamphetamine and the accused told George that he was going to engage in a 'cook' when he was released from custody to get some money together to move his family to Northern Queensland.

George offered to supply the accused with 2 kilograms of medical grade pseudoephedrine after he was released. The accused gave George [a woman's] telephone number. George informed police about this conversation in April. George was released from custody on 25 May 2009.
...
The offender was released to parole on 6 July 2009. That day George sent a text message to [the woman's] phone. A few minutes later [the respondent] called George from [the woman's] phone and a meeting was arranged. George informed police about this conversation.""

32Further arrangements were made, all with the knowledge of the police. George spoke to the respondent about sourcing large quantities of pseudoephedrine from a person named Christian (the undercover officer). It was arranged that the respondent would pay for the chemicals with guns he had in Queensland. During a meeting on 22 July 2009, there was a conversation in which the respondent told Christian that his role (apparently the respondent's - see appeal Tcpt, p 2 (37)-(40)) was to supply all the glassware, chemicals and lab, in return for half of the anticipated product, namely 4 kilograms of pure amphetamine, together with 2 revolvers for the initial batch of pseudoephedrine.

33On 25 July 2009, the respondent asked George to drive him to Queensland to recover the guns from bushland, which they did. On 30 July 2009, the respondent met Christian at an arranged place in western Sydney, and gave a revolver to Christian in part payment for the pseudoephedrine. Police arrested both the respondent and Christian and also the woman who was George's initial contact, who had driven the car to the meeting. The revolver was found not to be in working order.

34In due course the respondent's parole was revoked, with effect from 30 July 2009, when he was arrested, leaving him with a period of six months and nine days to be served, expiring on 7 February 2010. The penalty imposed for the conspiracy did not in fact commence until 30 March 2010. However, the nine month non-parole period imposed in respect of count 3 was back-dated to the date of arrest and thus was concurrent with (and exceeded) the whole of the balance of parole. The sentence on count 2 (the fixed term of 18 months) commenced on 30 December 2009, thus overlapping with the balance of parole, but only for a period of a little over one month. The 2.5 years non-parole period in respect of the conspiracy was concurrent with 15 months of the fixed term imposed for count 2 (and concurrent with one month of the non-parole period imposed for count 3).

35Although it was submitted that the commencement date for the sentences for the new offences should not properly have been backdated, the primary submission was that the extent of the backdating, to the commencement of custody relating to the new offences, was excessive. In circumstances where the offences constitute the reason for the revocation of parole, it is important not to double count the fact that the offences were committed whilst serving an incomplete sentence for an earlier offence, and whilst on parole for that offence. It is also necessary to consider whether there should be a degree of concurrency, to allow for the possibility that the respondent could have been re-paroled during the course of the balance of term on the earlier offence: Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145 at [21]-[23] (Simpson J, James and Hall JJ agreeing). A further factor to be taken into account on the appeal is that the prosecutor's submissions on sentence accepted the backdating to the commencement of the new period of custody. That factor is not conclusive against intervention, but is a consideration which may persuade the Court not to intervene in the exercise of its residual discretion. 

36As a degree of accumulation in respect of the new offences was permissible, the only issue in terms of concurrency was the failure to commence the first of the new sentences at some point after the date of arrest. Given the length of the balance of the term of the offence for which parole was revoked, the sentencing judge was not required to allow more than four months, attributable purely to the balance of the earlier term. That this would have been a relatively short increase in the overall sentence period is a factor which tends to weigh against intervention in the exercise of the Court's discretion, even if satisfied that such an additional period should have been imposed. 

(c) grounds 2 and 3 - manifest inadequacy
37The proposition underlying these grounds was that the starting point of eight years imprisonment was inadequate for a sentence carrying a maximum term of life imprisonment. A subsidiary complaint, which, it was submitted, partly explained the underestimation of the objective seriousness of the offending, concerned the manner in which the sentencing judge took into account the role of the police informant with whom the respondent discussed the proposed offending whilst in gaol and the involvement of the undercover officer with whom he continued the conspiracy following his release from prison. 

38The first question requires the establishment of a relevant range, in order to determine whether the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. The Director sought to establish a range on the basis of the additional material filed after the hearing of the appeal. That material revealed a small cohort of offences involving conspiracy and significant variation in the penalties imposed. In supplementary written submissions, counsel for the respondent contended that the Court ought not to have regard to sentences imposed after 1 February 2003 for offences to which a standard non-parole period applied. That would exclude from comparison all recent cases involving supply, as opposed to conspiracy to supply, the former being subject to the standard non-parole period, whereas that guidepost does not apply in respect of conspiracy offences: Diesing v R [2007] NSWCCA 326 at [53]-[54] (Hoeben, Latham and Harrison JJ). It is also possible that those offences to which a standard non-parole period is applicable had been inappropriately affected by application of the ""guidepost"" even where it does not apply, for example, because of a plea of guilty, inconsistently with the approach required by Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154. (The standard non-parole period for the offence of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine is 15 years.)

39The supplementary submissions for the Director included a table of offences referring variously to offences of supply, agreement to supply and knowingly taking part in supply of various quantities of a range of drugs. The table undoubtedly justifies the conclusion that for such offences, at least since the introduction of a standard non-parole period, the sentencing range is well in excess of that reflected in the respondent's sentence. However, a number cases involving conspiracy to supply large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs, in respect of sentencing prior to 1 February 2003, suggest a somewhat broader range:

Degen (NSWCCA, 12 October 1998, unreported): offence in respect of large commercial quantity of cocaine, facts not available - minimum term of two years with an additional term of three years.

Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66: conspiracy to supply large commercial quantity of heroin, other serious offences committed, including accessory after the fact to murder, plea of guilty and significant assistance - non-parole period of 2.5 years plus 2.5 years balance of term; not varied following a Crown appeal, except by way of accumulation on other sentences;

Bayeh [2000] NSWCCA 473: conspiracy to supply large commercial quantity of cocaine, including other offences for which fixed terms were imposed to be served concurrently - non-parole period of 15 years with three year additional term;

Yaghi [2002] NSWCCA 396; 133 A Crim R 490: conspiracy to supply large commercial quantity of heroin, plea of guilty, without relevant assistance - non-parole period of five years plus two years, six months;

Lam [2002] NSWCCA 377; 135 A Crim R 302: conspiracy to supply large commercial quantity of heroin - non-parole period 12 years plus four years (following a trial);

Cheng [2002] NSWCCA 225: conspiracy to supply large commercial quantity of heroin; offender played a middle-management role -non-parole period seven years plus five years (following a trial).

40A similar degree of variation can be found in respect of offences of manufacturing large commercial quantities and conspiracy to manufacture. El-Azzi [2004] NSWCCA 455 involved a conspiracy to manufacture a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The participants expected to produce 30 kilograms of methamphetamine, although it was more likely that the scheme would have produced 12.5 kilograms if successful (at [64] (Santow JA)). The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of five years three months with a balance of term of one year nine months from which an appeal was dismissed. The applicant did not plead nor provide assistance.

41The circumstances of the offending, as revealed in the agreed facts, involved the respondent being the instigator of the proposed conspiracy. The purpose of the manufacturing enterprise was to allow the respondent ""to get some money together to move his family to North Queensland"": judgment, p 3. Accordingly, the respondent was the principal in the proposed operation. The police informer, George, agreed to supply two kilograms of pseudoephedrine. In the event, George said he could not supply the pseudoephedrine, but knew a person who could: judgment, p 4. That person was an undercover officer. The proposal involved the manufacture of four kilograms of pure amphetamine, which the respondent proposed to split 50/50 with the undercover officer. Although the conspiracy was not likely to materialise into a choate offence, because of the identity of the other participants, that was not known to the respondent at the time. The respondent was not induced to enter into the conspiracy by the importuning of an informant or undercover officer: he had a specific purpose in mind and was the promoter of the scheme.

42While his motive was not essentially malign, but involved a step which might remove the respondent from the temptation to offend in the future and at the same time protect himself and his family from potential threats to their security as a result of his earlier activities in providing assistance to the authorities, motive is of limited significance. At best, in a negative sense it demonstrated an intention to commit one final offence, rather than a particular offence in a course of ongoing conduct. On the other hand, the fact that the offence was commenced, not merely whilst on conditional liberty for other offending, but whilst actually serving an earlier sentence, is itself a significant aggravating factor.

43In the circumstances, the proposed sentence, before reduction, of eight years imprisonment was undoubtedly lenient. Whether it was manifestly inadequate, warranting the intervention of this Court, need not be determined because, for other reasons, the Court should not intervene in the exercise of its discretion.

(d) ground 4 - double counting personal circumstances
44The element of double counting relied on under this ground was a particular circumstance said to form the basis of both the discount for assistance to authorities and the finding of special circumstances, permitting departure from the statutory ratio in respect of the non-parole period and the balance of term, pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1992 (NSW). In support of that submission, the Director relied upon a passage in the judgment of this Court in R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289; 191 A Crim R 409 at [75], where Harrison J (Beazley JA and Hislop J agreeing) stated:

""In my opinion, consideration of questions such as whether the respondent or his family were in any danger or were at risk of any injury would extend to and include matters such as the respondent's relocation following release and any difficulties that might be associated with the adoption of a new identity in those circumstances. These are matters that the Court must consider under s 23(2) if a reduced penalty for assistance to law enforcement authorities is being considered. Any use of these factors as matters amounting to special circumstances as well would in my opinion amount to double counting in this case. Whether or not that result would follow in every case is a matter upon which it is presently unnecessary to express a view.""

45A particular factor can legitimately serve two or more functions. Thus, it is difficult to consign considerations relevant to mitigating the rigour of a sentence which might otherwise be imposed into one of two or more discrete bundles. Typically, remorse or contrition will be a factor in providing a discount for a plea of guilty, a discount with respect to assistance to the authorities and in the overall assessment of the best way to provide for rehabilitation of the offender. Because in each respect the factor serves a different function or purpose in the sentencing process, it is not possible to isolate the particular element and disregard it in all contexts but one. In Regina v McLear (NSWCCA, 1 September 1992, unreported) Sheller JA (with whom Mathews and Sharpe JJ agreed) stated that a ""plea of guilty and the offer of assistance may in a particular case alone or in combination or in combination with other matters amount to exceptional circumstances"": at 14. His Honour had earlier stated at 10:

""Further it is submitted that his Honour ... seems to have taken account of the assistance offered by the applicant only as demonstrating 'sincere contrition'. It is said, I think with force, that quite apart from the question of contrition and whether the offer to give assistance is evidence of such, it is a matter which requires to be given separate consideration in terms of discount.""

46The possibility that there may be ""erroneous double counting"" would appear to impose a limitation upon the exercise. In R v Way at [178] the Court suggested that -

""... care needs to be taken to avoid double counting which has a relevance, in two potential ways:

(a) so far as any comparison is made with sentencing statistics [in particular cases], it is likely that the non-parole periods and the terms of the sentence which form part of the statistical array, will have already been reduced to take this factor into account;

(b) so far as the fact of protection might qualify as a special circumstance, it should not normally be used to reduce the non-parole period any further, if it has already been taken into account under s 21A of the Act.""

47A similarly cautious approach was adopted shortly thereafter in Regina v Barakat [2004] NSWCCA 201, where Greg James J stated (Beazley JA and Dowd J agreeing):

""[30] [The Queen v S [2000] NSWCCA 13; 111 A Crim R 225] is not authority for the proposition that in the event a head sentence is discounted, it is not open to a trial judge to take into account the matters producing that discount on the issue of the length of the non-parole period. As the High Court's decision in Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 makes clear, factors may bear differently upon the head sentence and the non-parole period and weigh differently on each .... Matters which have warranted a reduction in the head sentence might still be 'special circumstances' which might warrant an even shorter non-parole period than s 44 might otherwise mandate. ...

[31] But such circumstances may require a still shorter non-parole period if, in the particular case, the circumstances apply so heavily to the non-parole period that they bear the character of special circumstances (as to the potential nature of which see Regina v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704).

[32] In S ... Hulme J at 231 referred to the entitlement of the trial judge to have regard to the matters to which he referred and the combination of them as justifying a greater than usual proportion of the respondent's sentence 'being served on conditional liberty ... rather than actual custody', but concluded that, as a general proposition, leniency for assistance is best recognised by way of discount from the total sentence. He held that it was necessary to avoid a double discounting where a discount flowed through to a proportionate non-parole period from having been applied to the head sentence and a further discount for the same matter was expressly allowed on the non-parole period. Such would result in an inappropriate non-parole period.""

48In R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114, Samuels JA, after referring to the reasoning of the High Court in Griffiths v The Queen [1989] HCA 39; 167 CLR 372, stated in relation to the predecessor to s 44: at 116F:

""In determining whether there are special circumstances justifying a proportionate increase in the additional term the court must consider all the relevant circumstances; that is to say, ... all the factors which the prisoner's overall situation exhibits and which in combination make the case special and bear upon the suitability of a longer than normal additional term.""

49The Director stated in his written submissions that the basis for the finding of special circumstances was ""not clear"". However, the sentencing judge stated at 12:

""I consider that there are good reasons to find special circumstances in this case. The Crown, as I understand it, does not oppose such a finding but it is necessary for me to state, briefly, my reasons. Firstly, the serious assistance that is going to be required on release of the offender to enable him to have any hope of getting back into the community. This is going to take some considerable time.

Counsel for the offender referred to the fact that when looking at the actual facts of the offence the offender had no access to any of the precursor materials and was relying on someone to supply him. He said that whilst it is true that the offender has a history of previous convictions of significance and the offence was committed whilst he was on conditional liberty, the way in which it was committed involving George, the prison informer, should be taken into account and I have done so. Having reached the conclusion that there should be a finding of special circumstances this, of course, must be applied to each of the individual offences.""

50Given the lack of opposition from the prosecution at the sentencing hearing to a finding of special circumstances, there would need to be a clear case that the finding was inappropriate for this Court to intervene. The first reason given by the trial judge was a sufficient justification for such a finding. It was not a factor relevant to the overall sentence imposed. The function of the matters set out in the second paragraph of the reasons is more obscure, but appears to involve a balancing of other factors, the particular significance of which in the circumstances was not explained.

51Where a discount is provided for assistance to authorities, one factor being considered will be the likely circumstances of the offender's conditions of custody. That, of course, will only be contingently relevant in respect of the balance of term, although the discount will apply to the overall sentence. The immediate purpose of the discount will be to reduce the period of mandatory custody because the conditions are likely to be harsher than would otherwise be the case. That consideration may well warrant a finding of special circumstances. That is why in McLear the Court proposed that assistance to authorities might itself form the basis of a finding of special circumstances. Recognition of a double function would not involve erroneous double counting.

52This ground of challenge is not made good.

(e) ground 5 - failing to identify discount for future assistance
53There was no challenge to the discount of 25% with respect to assistance to authorities. Rather, the challenge was directed to the failure of the sentencing judge to specify the proportion on account of future assistance. Although s 23(4) of the Sentencing Procedure Act requires the sentencing court to identify the amount of the reduction of sentence on account of future assistance, that provision did not commence until 14 March 2011, after the sentencing in the present case. Accordingly, no reliance was placed upon the statutory requirement, but rather on the general principles referred to by Buddin J in SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [51]:

""It is timely to reiterate that sentencing judges should be careful to ensure that the component of the discount which relates to the promise of future assistance should be specifically quantified with a degree of precision. That allows the parties to know exactly what the position is and will also enable an appellate court to deal appropriately with any review brought by the Crown in the event that such promise is not fulfilled."" [Emphasis in original.]

54This authority (which was misattributed in the Director's written submissions) demonstrates that the general law position broadly accorded with the current requirements of s 23(4). The power to review in the case of a failure to perform an undertaking is found in s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

55If it were thought appropriate to intervene to correct this error, it would merely be a matter of specifying a proportion of the discount so provided, on the assumption that such further assistance as had been anticipated at the time of trial was still in the future. It would not be appropriate, in circumstances where there was no suggestion that an appeal was to brought under s 5DA in relation to past failure to comply with an undertaking, to apportion a discount in a way which would retrospectively affect conduct which had been in the future at the time of sentencing, but was now in the past.

56The affidavit of Ms Williams of 19 October 2011 is relevant in respect of this issue and should be admitted for that purpose. She identified a number of matters to which information supplied by the respondent may well have been relevant. In respect of one offender, the matter has proceeded on a plea of guilty and, in respect of other offenders, juries have returned verdicts of guilty. Those matters were listed for sentence in November and December 2011. It is unlikely that the respondent was expected to assist in relation to the sentencing proceedings, but in any event it may be assumed that the proceedings are now completed. The Director's submissions did not suggest that there was any matter outstanding, nor did they identify any proposed proportion which this Court might now adopt. In these circumstances, the ground is without substance and should be rejected.

Exercise of residual discretion
57This case was not presented by the Director as a test case, in the sense of one which was designed to establish a guideline for sentencing in the future. Given the subjective circumstances of the offender and the significant degree of assistance provided to the authorities, it might well have been thought inappropriate for such a purpose. That consideration, taken together with the fact that the Director provided little or no assistance to the Court at the original hearing in respect of the range of sentencing for the specific offence of conspiracy, militates against intervention, even though it may reasonably be assumed that the sentence was lenient and arguably so lenient as to demonstrate error.

58A further consideration in respect of the particular circumstances of the case was the troubling history of prior offending and prior assistance to the authorities. It was no doubt necessary, as a majority of the Court thought, to obtain further assistance in respect of that history in order to determine whether the sentence imposed in the present case was within an appropriate range. However, the delay resulting from such additional steps, taken cumulatively, should have (and should now be seen to) require rejection of the appeal in the exercise of the Court's discretion.

59In light of the various considerations set out above, the appropriate course is to dismiss the Director's appeal.

60RS HULME J: On 14 December 2010, the Respondent to this Crown appeal was sentenced by Delaney DCJ in respect of three offences which, in summary were:-

(i) Between 21 June and 30 July 2009 he conspired to manufacture amphetamine in an amount of not less than the large commercial quantity.

(ii) On 30 July 2009 he sold a prohibited firearm viz. a .44-40 Winchester calibre 6 chamber revolving cylinder shortened rifle to a police undercover operative not authorised to possess the firearm.

(iii) On 30 July 2009 he possessed a prohibited pistol viz. a .44-40 Winchester calibre 6 chamber revolving cylinder shortened rifle without being authorised to do so.

61In sentencing the Respondent for the first of these offences, his Honour took into account two further offences, one of possessing an unregistered firearm viz. ""a large calibre six shot pistol"", and a second of selling an unregistered firearm, being the said pistol.

62The sentences imposed by his Honour were:-

(i) Imprisonment for 4 years including a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, both such periods commencing on 30 March 2010.

(ii) Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing on 30 December 2009.

(iii) Imprisonment for 18 months including a non-parole period of 9 months both such periods commencing on 30 July 2009.

63Thus the effective sentence was of imprisonment for 4 years and 8 months including a non-parole period of 3 years and 2 months. In this connection, it is also to be noted that, having been released from a prior period of custody and admitted to parole on 6 July 2009, he was arrested in respect of the charges presently under consideration on 30 July 2009. Furthermore, on 21 August 2009, that parole was revoked as from the date of his arrest and he was ordered to serve the balance of his previous sentence's term of 6 months and 9 days commencing on 30 July 2009 and expiring on 7 February 2010.

64The maximum periods of imprisonment prescribed for the offences are, respectively, life imprisonment, 5 years imprisonment and 14 years imprisonment. In respect of the offence I have numbered (iii) a standard non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment has been prescribed.

65The circumstances that led to the charging of the Respondent were as follows. While the Respondent was in custody serving an earlier sentence, he met George, a prison informer. The Respondent told George that when he was released from custody he intended to engage in a cook in order to obtain money to move his family interstate. George offered to supply 2 kilograms of medical grade pseudoephedrine after he was released. The Respondent gave George his wife's telephone number. There followed a conversation between the offender and his wife which was intercepted by police. 

66After the Respondent was released George sent a text message to the Respondent's wife's phone, the Respondent called George and a meeting was arranged. At the meeting the proposed cook was discussed, George told the Respondent he could not supply the pseudoephedrine but he knew someone who could and a second meeting was organised. Later the Respondent told George he would pay for the pseudoephedrine with guns he had in another State. At a meeting with an undercover officer who was introduced as the pseudoephedrine supplier, the Respondent agreed to manufacture 4 kilograms of pure methylamphetamine which he agreed to split 50/50. During this conversation the Respondent said he planned to sell the amphetamines to freight train drivers and agreed to provide the undercover officer with two revolvers as payment for the initial batch of pseudoephedrine.

67Some days later, the Respondent arranged for George to drive him interstate. This occurred. According to a statement of ""Agreed Facts"", the Respondent alighted from the car near some bushland and then returned with a full rifle bag. From the bag the Respondent removed a revolver which he retained. On meeting the undercover officer some days later, the Respondent entered the undercover officer's car, showed him the ""revolver"" which was then secured in the boot. Soon afterwards the Respondent was arrested. 

68Despite the second and third charges referring to a ""6 chamber revolving cylinder shortened rifle"" and the Form 1 referring to a ""a large calibre six shot pistol"", and although the matter is not entirely clear, it seems to me that both documents were intended to refer to the one ""revolver"" mentioned in the ""Agreed Facts"". This document went on to say that on inspection the revolver was not in working order but was at one time capable of propelling a projectile"". 

69Delaney DCJ concluded that the offence of possessing the weapon which was the subject of count 3, was close to the bottom of the range of objective seriousness because of ""the circumstances in which it was produced, the reason for its production, and the observations as to its capacity for use, (and) the fact that there was no ammunition involved with it"". His Honour went on to observe that he had received assistance from the views expressed in R v Parkinson [2010] NSWCCA 89.

70Because they were not the subject of a standard non-parole period, Delaney DCJ declined to express a view as to the objective seriousness of the other two offences but noted that they were committed in circumstances where the Respondent met an undercover office or jail informant in jail and ""took steps to become involved in the conspiracy as a consequence of this"". His Honour took into account also that the conspiracy was stopped in consequence of the Respondent's arrest.

71His Honour also expressed the view that as the offences were all part of the one course of action, any accumulation should be de minimis. He gave no reasons for selecting 30 July 2009 as the commencing date despite submissions from the Crown that custody under the present charges should commence on 8 February 2010.

72His Honour accepted that the Respondent was remorseful and had a significant desire for rehabilitation and concluded that he was unlikely to commit further offences. His Honour indicated he placed reliance on a report of a psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro, quoting the following:-

[DW] has now detoxified and is thinking more clearly. He however remains highly vulnerable at a psychological level in the absence of treatment. He stated that it has been logistically very difficult for him to see a therapist due to his placement at the SPC notwithstanding his strong desire and clear need for treatment to commence. The nature of his confinement in virtual solitary conditions has further compounded his escalating sense of despair regarding the future. He claims that there is a significant bounty on his life and in this regard given the nature of assistance he has provided his apprehension concerning the possibility of being murdered appears to be quite realistic. In this context this man requires considerable supportive psychotherapy, in addition to specific cognitive behaviour therapy to address issues such as relapse prevention and social skills training. His depression is at a level where the introduction where psychotropic medication should be considered, with this clearly being overseen by a treating Psychiatrist. In the absence of the type of treatment I am suggesting his clinical prognosis is poor.

73His Honour went on to say that he accepted that opinion, that before the Respondent detoxified he had a significant addiction and also had psychological problems that went back to an earlier time and referable to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

74The Respondent was born in 1969. He has a criminal record that includes a limited number of offences of dishonesty prior to 1992. His next conviction was in September 2008 for two counts of the supply of an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug and one of dealing with property being the suspected proceeds of crime. For the first two counts he was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years including non-parole periods of 10 months, both periods commencing on 8 February 2008. The sentence for the third count was less and concurrent. Later that year he was convicted of a number of driving offences including driving whilst his licence was suspended and in November 2008 of supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug, possessing a precursor intended to be used in manufacture of a prohibited drug and of possessing ammunition without holding a licence. The sentence imposed for the last of these offences was such as to indicate that the offence was not serious. For the supply offence the sentence imposed was of imprisonment for 15 months including a non-parole period of 10 months commencing on 7 September 2008. For the possession offence the sentence was of a concurrent term of imprisonment for 10 months. 

75In arriving at the sentences he imposed, Delaney DCJ allowed a discount of 50% for the Respondent's pleas and assistance. It seems clear from his Honour's remarks that half of this was for the Respondent's plea and the discount for assistance was influenced by his Honour's conclusions that the assistance the Respondent had given in the past and would give in the future was significant and had placed both the Respondent and his wife at risk of death. In light of evidence that had been placed before him, his Honour was also satisfied that that the Respondent's conditions of incarceration were onerous.

76His Honour also made a finding of special circumstances in consequence of the ""serious assistance that is going to be required on release of the offender to enable him to have any hope of getting back into the community (which) ... is going to take some considerable time"". When the possibility of such a finding had been raised with the Crown during submissions, the Crown agreed that there were special circumstances but added:-

But then the main special circumstance your Honour I think be a factor that would be taken into account under s 23G to ... and given the two discounts that are already open to the Court it may leave the sentences in the position where they don't reflect the objective seriousness of the matters. (sic - as transcribed)

77The grounds of appeal relied upon by the Crown were:-

1: His Honour erred in commencing the sentence on 30 July 2009, the date of the Respondent's arrest.

2: His Honour erred in determining the fact that the offending behaviour involved communication with an undercover officer or gaol informant as a factor which considerably reduced the objectivity gravity of the criminality.

3: His Honour erred in determining a starting point of 8 years for the offence of conspiring to manufacture a prohibited drug (large commercial quantity).

4: His Honour erred in double counting subjective factors.

5: The sentencing judge erred in failing to nominate the percentage discount for future assistance.

6: His Honour erred in imposing a lesser sentence for count 3 than the sentence for count 2.

7: His Honour erred in failing to properly accumulate the sentences to reflect the principal of totality.

8: The sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.

78In opening her case during the appeal, counsel for the Crown said that she wished to amend this last ground to ""The sentence for the conspiracy is manifestly inadequate as is the total sentence"". In my consideration of the eighth ground, I will proceed on this more limited basis.

Ground 1

His Honour erred in commencing the sentence on 30 July 2009, the date of the Respondent's arrest.

79There is no doubt that the decision as when, within a period of revoked parole, another sentence should commence is a matter of discretion - see Callaghan v R (2006) 160 A Crim R 145. It may be at the beginning; it may be at the end; it may be somewhere in between. A number of matters are liable to inform the exercise of that discretion. Without attempting to be exhaustive, one is the fact that imprisonment for the period of revoked parole is, in its origins, due to the sentence pursuant to which the period when the offender was eligible for parole was granted. Revocation may have occurred because it has been demonstrated that an offender has been unable to adapt to normal community life. A second, although there will commonly be overlapping with the first, may be as in this case, that the revocation arises in consequence of a new offence for which a fresh sentence is being imposed, rather than for some unconnected cause. A third and fourth are likely to be the period served with apparent adherence to the terms of parole and the periods of revocation and for which the revocation is liable to continue. 

80In this case, as has been said, his Honour provided no reasons for his decision to commence the first of the sentences he imposed at the commencement of the period of revocation. He effectively made concurrent so much of the earlier sentence as post-dated 30 July 2009 and approximately 6 months of the sentences he was imposing. In doing so he effectively reduced the sentence he was imposing by the 6 months period of concurrency or, from another perspective, nullified the effect of the decision of the State Parole Authority to require the Respondent to serve the balance of parole under the earlier sentences. I am unable to see any reasonable basis for the course his Honour took unless considerations of totality justified it. Whether they did is best left for consideration in conjunction with grounds 3 and 8. 

Ground 2

His Honour erred in determining the fact that the offending behaviour involved communication with an undercover officer or gaol informant as a factor which considerably reduced the objectivity gravity of the criminality.

81The first matter to be noted in considering this ground is that his Honour did not say that the matters referred to in this ground ""considerably reduced the objective gravity of the criminality"". 

82The second is that his Honour did say:-

I do note in relation to the extent of the criminality however, that those matters (the offences the subject of counts 2 and 3) were committed in circumstances where the offender met an undercover officer or gaol informant in gaol and took steps to become involved in the conspiracy as a consequence of this. I have also taken into account that the conspiracy, whilst it was discussed at length, was stopped at a particular point of time by the police arresting the offender.

And later,

Counsel for the offender referred to the fact that when looking at the actual facts of the offence the offender had no access to any of the precursor materials and was relying on someone to supply him. He said that whilst it is true that the offender has a history of previous convictions of significance and the offence was committed whilst he was on conditional liberty, the way in which it was committed involving George the prison informer, should be taken into account and I have done so.

83These last quoted remarks were made in the middle of his Honour's discussion of ""special circumstances"" and their position provides grounds for a submission by the Crown that they were relied on by his Honour for finding special circumstances. However, the involvement of a police informant is so obviously irrelevant to the topic of special circumstances that I cannot believe that his Honour had regard to them in that connection. It seems to me more probable that they happened to be included there because his Honour had forgotten to include them in some more appropriate place in his remarks. 

84His Honour's statement to the effect that the Respondent became involved ""as a consequence"" of meeting the gaol informant in gaol was wrong or at the least, misleading. The agreed facts indicate that the Respondent told the informant that he was going to engage in a ""cook"" when released in order to obtain money to move his family elsewhere. When after his release the gaol informant spoke to the Respondents' wife, she told him that she knew all about it. Although it may be accepted that a conspiracy involving the gaol informant would not have occurred had they not met in gaol, it is clear that the Respondent's intention to participate in a ""cook"" was independent of the gaol informant and it was something that he had discussed with his wife so as to at least raise the possibility that independent of the involvement of the gaol informant the Respondent was engaged in a conspiracy. 

85Be that as it may, and while the police informant actively participated in the conspiracy with the Respondent, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Respondent's criminality was the product of the informant's encouragement or would not have occurred in any event. It is not apparent in what way his Honour took into account the police informer's involvement but that involvement was utterly irrelevant in the making of any assessment of the Respondent's subjective criminality.

86Although not in terms, in substance this ground is made out.

Ground 3

87It is convenient to consider this ground in conjunction with Ground 8.

Ground 4

His Honour erred in double counting subjective factors.

88I have set out above what seem to me to be his Honour's reasons for finding special circumstances. The Crown suggested that the import of these remarks is not clear but that ""the serious assistance"" to which his Honour referred presumably referred to the Respondent and his family entering the witness protection program and re-settling elsewhere. Reference was made to R v AD (2008) 191 A Crim R 409 at [75] where this Court warned that to take such matters into account when deciding what discount there should be for assistance and as a basis for a finding of special circumstances was to double count. 

89However, I am not satisfied that the inference that the Crown suggests should be drawn. In the passage quoted by Delaney DCJ and above, Mr Watson-Munro had said that the Respondent needed considerable therapy and it seems to me more likely that it was this assistance to which his Honour was referring.

90This ground fails.

Ground 5

The sentencing judge erred in failing to nominate the percentage discount for future assistance.

91While there are a number of authorities that point out the desirability of sentencing judge's specifying the extent of any discount for future assistance - see SZ v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at [51] and the cases there cited - and s 23(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 - introduced since the sentencing of the Respondent - now requires that this be done, it is also clear that the mere failure to do so is not a ground upon which to allow an appeal and quash a sentence - see s 23(6).

92This ground also fails.

Ground 6

His Honour erred in imposing a lesser sentence for count 3 than the sentence for count 2.

93I have set out above his Honour's conclusion that the offence the subject of count 3 was close to the bottom of the range of objective seriousness for such an offence and his Honour's reasons for that conclusion. It may be inferred that his Honour's reference to the weapon's capacity for use related to the statement in the ""Agreed Facts"" that the weapon was not in working order but was at one time capable of propelling a projectile. The Respondent had given evidence that the weapon was old and that he had kept it as a collectible and, although he was cross-examined on other matters, was not challenged on this statement. 

94As indicated above, the maximum periods of imprisonment prescribed for counts 2 and 3 (respectively the sale and possession of the weapon) are 5 years and 14 years and that in the case of the offence the subject of count 3 a standard non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment has been prescribed. Otherwise the only guidance one derives for his Honour's choice of penalties are his remarks to the effect:-

""In my opinion, the offence of selling a prohibited firearm to an unauthorised user should carry, for a sentence at trial, a penalty of three years imprisonment. I reduce that head sentence by fifty percent before consideration of the application of the special circumstances to vary the ratio.

In relation to the third count of possess and sell an unregistered firearm I consider that having regard to the views that I have expressed as to the objective seriousness of that offence that the appropriate sentence, noting that the non-parole period is not applicable but remains a reference point, is a period of three years imprisonment which should also receive a deduction of fifty percent. 

95Thereafter his Honour imposed sentences of imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months on count 2 and on count 3, imprisonment for 18 months including a non-parole period of 9 months. 

96His Honour's remarks, particularly when combined with the sentences imposed display a deal of confusion. Given earlier remarks as to the nature of the weapon, it is difficult to think that his Honour's reference to ""penalty"" in the first of the paragraphs just quoted was intended to refer to a non-parole period for that would tend to reflect a total sentence of at least 4 years, only one year short of the statutory maximum. But if the reference to ""penalty"" was to the total sentence, the period included both non-parole and balance of term. A 50% reduction of such a non-parole period would result in a non-parole period, or fixed term of less than the 18 months imposed. Thus the 18 months fixed term for the second offence would seem to have been a mistake.

97Given the terms of the third count, the reference ""and sell"" in the first line of the second of the paragraphs just quoted is also clearly a mistake. In any event, whatever the reason, when regard is had to the difference in penalties provided for the offences the subject of counts 2 and 3, there is no logical basis for the fixed term imposed for count 2 being twice as long as the non-parole period imposed for count 3. 

98I would uphold this ground.

Ground 7

His Honour erred in failing to properly accumulate the sentences to reflect the principal of totality.

99As has been indicated the Respondent had been ordered to serve the balance of parole from an earlier sentence for 6 months and 9 days from 30 July 2009. The starting dates for the sentences for counts 3, 2 and 1 fixed by Delaney DCJ were respectively 30 July 2009, 30 December 2009 and 30 March 2010. Thus, putting aside the concurrency with the revoked parole, only 8 months of the sentences imposed for counts 2 and 3 represented additional time to be served.

100His Honour gave a reason for this. He remarked that, ""as these offences were all part of the one course of action any accumulation would be de minimis"". While I am by no means sure that I would have taken the same approach, and the extent of accumulation is certainly something that this Court is free in appropriate circumstances to overrule, concurrency and accumulation of sentence are matters of discretion and in the circumstances of the case I am not persuaded that the view he took so far as concurrency of the three sentences he imposed was concerned, was not one open to his Honour.

101This ground fails.

Grounds 3 and 8

3: His Honour erred in determining a starting point of 8 years for the offence of conspiring to manufacture a prohibited drug (large commercial quantity).

8: The sentence for the conspiracy is manifestly inadequate as is the total sentence.

102The Crown made clear that the third ground was the foundation for its complaint in the eighth.

103His Honour provided no explanation for selecting 8 years as a starting point beyond the remark:-

It seems to me that the count of conspiracy to manufacture a commercial quantity of a prohibited amphetamine is a case that would attract a head sentence of eight years after trial. I discount that sentence by fifty percent. 

104In her original submissions, counsel for the Crown relied on one case, R v AD, to support the contention that the 8 years starting point was too low. Seeking to argue a manifest severity or inadequacy appeal from one or a few selected cases has been the subject to trenchant criticism by this Court over many years. Following remarks during the oral hearing to the effect that the Crown's reliance on only R v AD was an unsatisfactory way of conducting a Crown appeal the Crown subsequently supplied to the Court schedules of cases in this Court dealing with conspiracy to manufacture a large commercial quantity, the manufacture of a large commercial quantity, conspiracy to supply a large commercial quantity and supply a large commercial quantity. In addition the Crown provided sentencing graphs and lists of cases dealt with in the District and higher courts in relation to many of the drug offences.

105In response, counsel for the Respondent correctly submitted that the Court should not pay regard to sentences influenced by the standard non-parole periods as those periods do not apply to conspiracy charges - see R v Ohar [2004] NSWCCA 83; (2004) 59 NSWLR 596 at [84] - [85]; Diesing v R [2007] NSWCCA 326 at [53]. Counsel also submitted that supply and manufacture were different in their inherent nature and accordingly the Court should exercise care in relying on the cases of supply. Quite what the care referred to was not explained but in any event I am unable to see that manufacture is inherently less criminal than supply.

106Counsel for the Respondent also provided tables of cases dealing with the supply of large commercial quantities of heroin, cocaine, methylamphetamine and ecstasy and reference to a number of cases dealing with the manufacture, knowingly taking part in the manufacture and conspiracy to manufacture methylamphetamine. The cases referred to in this last group include R v Larsson (unreported, NSWCCA 11 September 1997), R v S (2000) 111 A Crim R 225, McMillan v R (2000) NSWCCA 241, Pedavoli v R (2002) 128 A Crim R 137, El Azzi v R [2004] NSWCCA 455 and Lau v R [2010] NSWCCA 43. My own researches have disclosed a number of others, some of which are referred to below.

107Before turning to a consideration of the cases, one argument relied on by the Crown should be referred to. It was submitted that little weight should be afforded to the fact that the respondent's offending did not result in the dissemination of drugs into the community. In support reference was made to a number of cases. Thus in Truong v R [2006] NSWCCA 318 at [26], Howie J, with the assent of the other members of the bench, remarked:-

Nor is the seriousness of the offence mitigated to any great degree because the drug was not actually disseminated to the community: see R v Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103. That fact has no bearing on the applicant's moral culpability for the offence.

108Chan's case was one where the Court was dealing with a sentencing judge's attraction to a submission that some diminution of the prisoner's culpability was to be found in an undercover police officer being involved and was concerned to reject such a view unless the offender had been provoked into committing an offence or more extensive criminality than would otherwise have occurred. At [21] Smart J, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, observed:-

In assessing the sentence to be imposed it is relevant to take into account that the prohibited drugs supplied to undercover agents will not be disseminated into the community. Of itself this is usually unlikely to lead to other than a very minor diminution of culpability. The offender had the intention to supply and in supplying knew and believed that the drugs would be likely to find their way into the community. The fact that they did not do so was not due to the offender. 

109His Honour also cited with approval a number of passages from the R v Taouk (1993) 65 A Crim R 387. One of the passages quoted was:-

... with sentencing ... the fundamental task of the court is always to evaluate the criminality involved. The sentencing process is concerned with the levels of culpability of the offender who, whether as a result of police incitement, inducement or encouragement or otherwise embarks upon criminal conduct. 

110In R v Gao & Lim [2007] NSWCCA 343, Latham J remarked:-

... the Judge was entitled to find that, because the supply to an undercover operative prevented the drugs from finding their way into the community, the objective gravity of the offences was diminished accordingly, albeit slightly. 

111Her Honour went on to quote from R v Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103, including the passage I have set out above. 

112In R v Gao & Lim, Rothman J said:-

47 No principle establishes as a general proposition that the fact, simpliciter, that the drugs are sold to undercover police and do not, therefore, reach the public, diminishes the culpability of the offending.

48 In such an undercover operation, it is beneficial to the community that the drugs are not able to be used. But that benefit is the result of the actions of law enforcement agencies, and not the result of any intention or action of the person charged. That there are no victims to such a sale may be a factor, like many others, that a sentencing judge takes into account, but for my own part, I would not generally consider it significant.

113On the other hand, in that case - at [30] - and with the concurrence of Basten JA, Latham J remarked:-

The fact that, had the drugs been supplied, they would not have found their way into the community was of some significance in the context of an agreement to supply such a large amount of ecstasy. 

114In Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 at [41] Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreed said:-

The fact that the drugs actually supplied would not be disseminated to the community because the supply took place to an undercover police operative does not materially assist the Applicant. The Applicant fully intended that the drugs would be disseminated to the community, and it was no act of the Applicant which stood in the way of such dissemination: Ly v R [2008] NSWCCA 262 at [27].

115With due respect to the authors of these statements, a number of them seem to be inconsistent with the long-standing principle that the criminal law is concerned with the consequences of offending. Thus in Savvas v The Queen [1995] 183 CLR 1 at 6 the High Court embraced the proposition that, ""A considerable number of more recently reported cases illustrate the imposition of sentences by reference to what was actually done in the transaction of the conspiracy"". 

116To similar effect are the remarks of Gaudron J in Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656 at [29] where her Honour described as an ""undoubted proposition"" that ""... a sentencing judge is entitled to have regard to the harm done to the victim by the commission of the crime"". Observations of the Chief Justice in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231B are to similar effect. A bank robber who escapes with $1M is likely to receive a significantly longer sentence than one who gains but $1,000 for similar activities.

117I have no difficulty in accepting that, absent circumstances where criminality has been exacerbated by or at the instigation of authorities, the circumstance that the authorities have been complicit in offending or have prevented drugs from being disseminated into the community, in no way mitigates the subjective criminality of the offender. However, if the involvement of the authorities prevents the transaction from resulting in harm, it is illogical not to afford that fact appropriate weight just as in the converse situation one would take account of any damage that was a consequence of the offending. Insofar as the authorities to which I have referred suggest the contrary or that the significance of the absence of dissemination into the community is slight or ""very minor"", they are in my view wrong. Of course, in any comparison with sentences in past cases, it must be recognised that most of those are also cases where there has been no, or no significant, dissemination of drugs.

118I turn then to a number of cases that provide guidance on the issue of an appropriate starting point in a determination of the Respondent's sentence. 

119In R v Cool (unreported, NSWCCA 30 June 1992), this Court refused to interfere with a sentence of nine years and eight months including a minimum term of seven years and four months on an offender who had pleaded guilty and was regarded as about the middle of the hierarchy of a sophisticated operation which produced some 18 kg of amphetamine over a nine week period. Although the extent of the discount was not stated, he was regarded as having given ""massive"" assistance to the authorities.

120In R v Larsson (unreported, NSWCCA 11 September 1997), this Court refused to interfere with a sentence of 12 years including a minimum term of seven years on a co-offender who was involved in the setting up of a manufacturing laboratory and in the training of another person in the procedures involved in the manufacture of amphetamines. Larsson also provided some equipment and some $54,000 in furtherance of the venture (albeit it is not clear whether these monies came from the Respondent's own funds or represented proceeds of the operation) and visited the laboratory three or four times per week. The offences were committed whilst on bail. Larsson had pleaded guilty and it was accepted that on a number of accounts, prison would operate more harshly on him than is usual. With the concurrence of the other members of the Court, I observed that Larsson was fortunate the penalty imposed was not higher.

121At the time of the sentence the subject of appeal, Larsson was serving another sentence including a minimum term of 6 years so totality must have operated to reduce the second sentence.

122R v Spyridis (unreported, NSWCCA 21 December 1998) was a case where there was no appeal against a sentence of seven years including a minimum term of five years for an offender who had knowingly made his premises available for the manufacture of amphetamines. Some 13.5 kg were found on the premises although the purity was low. Barr J observed that no less than about 1.1 kg of pure methylamphetamine must have been manufactured. The offender had pleaded not guilty.

123In R v Thompson & Falconer [1999] NSWCCA 50, a two-judge bench reduced to seven years and four months including a non-parole period of five years and six months the sentence imposed on offenders for the manufacture of just under 800 grams of methylamphetamine and who had no significant criminal history. It was accepted that some of the drug was to be retained for Mr Falconer's own use. Mr Thompson had pleaded guilty.

124In R v Spaliviero (unreported, CCA 15 December 1993), the offender had committed some 15 offences of which three concerned drugs. The drug offences included one charge of conspiring to manufacture, one of conspiring to supply and one of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. All of the offences seem to have been an incident of the one activity and the part played by Spaliviero of lesser significance than that of his co-offenders. A large, but unstated quantity was said to have found its way onto the market in Sydney in consequence. This Court took the view that the appropriate starting point for each of the drug offences should be of the order of 13 years including minimum terms of 10 years, all such sentences to be served concurrently. For reasons into which it is unnecessary to go, the sentences imposed were less.

125In R v S (2000) 111 A Crim R 225, this Court took the view that the starting point for a sentence on an offender who knowingly took part in the manufacture of not less than a large commercial quantity of amphetamine should not have been less than eight years. There was otherwise no evidence of the quantity of drug involved. It was the offender's second offence and had been committed on bail. On the other hand, the offender was not a principal, the offence had been committed under pressure from some of the drug ""heavies"" in Sydney, and it was found that since his apprehension the offender had thrown off his drug dependency and acquired ""a genuine determination not to return to drug use, manufacture or supply"". He was also entitled to a discount in accordance with R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603.

126In R v Opa [2004] NSWCCA 464, after a review of authorities, and with the concurrence of Levine J, I adopted as a starting point a sentence of 13 years for an offender who knowingly took part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of ecstasy. The amount involved was 3.1 grams or a little over 6 times the minimum large commercial quantity. The offender's role was substantial, albeit he was an underling.

127In R v AD (2008) 191 A Crim R 409, this Court allowed a Crown appeal and in doing so imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 9 years and 6 months including non-parole period of 6 years on an offender who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture no less than the large commercial quantity of MDMA or ecstasy. The quantity envisaged was substantially in excess of 1 kilogram. The sentence was arrived at after allowing a discount of 55% for a plea and assistance.

128In the above I have not attempted a comprehensive review of the dozens of cases to which the Court was referred because I am satisfied that those mentioned provide a sufficient guide. Although the sentences imposed in R v Spyridis, and R v Thompson and Falconer and the starting point in R v S were less, those cases were affected by considerations to which I have referred and which are not present here. On the other hand, it must be recognised that the Respondent's motivation - obtaining funds to start a new life away from dangers attributable to his past assistance to authorities - can not be regarded as pure naked greed and no drugs were in fact manufactured. That said, the other cases to which I have referred indicate that the starting point of 8 years adopted by Delaney DCJ was manifestly inadequate. In my view it should not have been less than 12 years.

129Thus I would uphold ground 3. Ground 8 is however affected by other considerations, in particular the allowance that should be made to the Respondent for assistance and any unusual features of his imprisonment. As has been said, Delaney DCJ allowed the Respondent a discount of 50% for assistance and the Respondent's plea.

130The evidence of assistance was provided by, including annexures, 5 documents. In a number of respects they were somewhat confusing because, while they did indicate the provision of very considerable assistance on more than one occasion and relating to more than one police investigation, they also indicated that, to an unspecified degree, some of this assistance had been taken into account in the Respondent's favour during prior sentencing proceedings. Thus it was that the Registrar, at the request of the Court, on 14 September 2011 wrote to the parties seeking clarification and a response to a number of questions, viz:-

(i) Is it only the further statement (and presumably willingness to give evidence) referred to in paragraph 37 of Detective (X's) report that has not been taken into account previously.

(ii) Is the Court at liberty to give the Respondent a further discount for the assistance taken into account previously?

(iii) Should the Court give such a further discount?

(iv) How valuable was the Respondent's assistance?

(v) What were the discounts given previously?

(vi) If those discounts were calculated on a percentage basis, given the offences and sentences in respect of which the discounts were given were relatively low on the scale, did those discounts appropriately reflect the value of the Respondent's assistance?

(vii) Does information referred to in the preceding questions amount to fresh evidence?

(viii) If so, is the Court at liberty to take it into account and should the Court do so?

(ix) Do any of the above matters, in combination with the conditions of the Respondent's incarceration, justify increasing the discount allowed by Delaney DCJ?

(x) Can the parties deal with these further matters by agreement or in documents or should there be a further hearing?

131Both parties replied to these questions, the Crown on 25 October 2011 and the Respondent on 16 November 2011 although it should be said that the response from the Crown to some of the questions was not as clear as it might have been. That said, both parties answered ""yes"" to question (ii), the Crown adding reference to s 23(2) (f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and a number of cases - Shaba v R [2011] NSWCCA 154 at [16], Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 23 at [20]-[23]; R v Day (No 3) [2010] NSWDC 40 at [22] and R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 in which there are statements that assistance should normally attract a discount only once but also to the effect that there is no rigid formula and the Court has a wide discretion. 

132Both parties also effectively answered ""no"" to question 7 and neither requested a further hearing. It is accordingly appropriate to deal with the merits of the issue.

133Any allowance by way of a discount for assistance is liable to be low if the sentence in respect of which the discount is given is itself one that is relatively low in the range of sentences. Partly this is liable to be the result if the usual method of calculating the discount in percentage terms is employed. Partly it will be low because of the terms of s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which requires:-

A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

134This consequence itself argues for the conclusion that an identified degree of assistance should be able to be taken into account on more than one occasion if the person who has rendered that assistance falls to be sentenced more than once. There is no logic in valuing a particular degree to assistance purely by reference to the length of the first sentence thereafter to be imposed on the person who has provided that assistance. Although not necessarily directed to discounts for assistance being granted on more than one occasion, s 23(2)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act also envisages that an offender may derive benefits on more than one occasion.

135Turning to the situation of the Respondent, it is unnecessary to particularise the assistance beyond saying that it was extremely valuable, fell into the exceptional category and led to convictions of a number of offenders, one for very substantial drug dealing and some for murder. 

136The discount for the Respondent's assistance taken into account in the determination of the first sentence presently relevant was 33 1/3% of a starting point of 4 years imprisonment and the discount for assistance taken into account in the determination of the second sentence presently relevant was 25% of a starting point of 2½ years imprisonment. These discounts thus totalled 23½ months. The discount given by Delaney DCJ on account of the Respondent's assistance was 25% of his Honour's starting point of 8 years. Thus the total discount that the Respondent has received is, in round figures, 4 years.

137That in my view is appreciably less than his assistance is worth. Indeed, even to apply the discount of 25% to the higher starting point of 12 years that I favour would in my view still undervalue that assistance.

138Arguing in the same direction are the consequences to the Respondent for his assistance. In remarking on this in one of the prior proceedings, Goldring DCJ said ""(the Respondent) has received death threats and he is in fear of his life. ... (the) death threats .. had a number of consequences for him including a relapse into drug use which resulted in (further charges)"". During the hearing in this Court the Crown conceded that:-

The Crown case is that he was doing this (ie involvement in the conspiracy) to raise money to go to Queensland because prior to this offending, he had already been a police informant and needed to get away and this was how he was going to do it, and it was for financial purposes.

139During the proceedings before Delaney DCJ the Respondent had given evidence about the conditions of his incarceration. The evidence was not challenged but is not entirely clear and seems to have some internal inconsistencies. It was to the effect that he was not allowed to socialise freely with other inmates although he was doing maintenance works around the gaol areas and doing a handyman course. He had access to a library. He was allowed out of his cell for 6 hours a day during the week. At weekends he was given access to a yard and an extra half hour out of his cell. He and one other particular prisoner rotate so each spends 3 of every 6 months in ""solitary"", locked away by themselves.

140An affidavit from the Respondent read during the Court of Criminal Appeal hearing included the following:-

4. I am currently unable to progress through the prison classification system due to the fact that I am being held in strict-strict protective custody. I will never be moved from a maximum security gaol even though I am now a minimum ""c"" classification.

5. Long Bay Special Purpose Centre is a ""strict-strict"" protective custody centre. It is like a prison within a prison due to the mix of inmates housed here, all of whom are crown witnesses. There are significantly more restrictions placed on our living conditions than those imposed on other inmates at other facilities.

6. We are housed here in secret and the officers only know and refer us by a number (sic). The following are some of the restrictions I face at Long Bay Special purpose centre:

· I have very limited number of visitors and all my visitors have to be screened and approved by the governor. The screening application is only available twice a year. In between that, no variation can be made to my visitor list.

...

· I am unable to get weekend leave or works release.

· Very often, the centre would have a 24 hour lock down. I have diarised 83 times when I have been locked down in 2010.

7. For instance, I was locked in my cell for 41 hours continuous from 2.30 pm on Sunday, 7 November 2010 until 7.30 am on Tuesday, 8 November 2010. Then we were let out for just three hours before being locked back in for another 19 hours until 7.30 am on Wednesday 10 November 2011. This is simply one example of something that happens all the time at the Centre. (This paragraph is re-produced as it appears in the original affidavit.) 

...

12. My life and the lives of my family are constantly under threat. On one instance, officers from Witness Protection deemed it necessary to urgently pick my wife and our children up and place them in a safe house until the threat had passed. My wife is currently being treated by a psychiatrist.

...

15. After my sentence, my incarceration conditions in the centre have not improved ...

141There was no objection to the affidavit, the deponent was not cross-examined, there was no affidavit in reply, and nor did the Crown make any request for an adjournment of the hearing in order to respond. When replying to the Registrar's letter of 14 September the Crown however forwarded an affidavit dated 25 October 2011 which denied a deal, but by no means all, of the Respondent's evidence just recounted. As Basten JA has pointed out, there had been no leave granted to adduce such further evidence - indeed, no such leave had been sought - and the affidavit should be rejected. The Court should accordingly proceed on what is in effect the uncontradicted and unchallenged evidence of the Respondent 

142That evidence reveals conditions of custody substantially worse than those experienced by the general prison population and one way or another the Respondent's sentence should be reduced from what it would otherwise have been to take account of the fact.

143In R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92, with the agreement of McClellan CJ, Howie J remarked:-

(4) However, it is no longer inevitable that an offender who has provided assistance will serve the sentence I more difficult conditions. As was pointed out in R v Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304 the experience of this Court at least has been that prisoners who have provided assistance are not serving their sentences, or even a significant part of their sentences, in any more onerous conditions than prisoners in the general prison population. In Mostyn the appellant's discount was reduced when the Court came to re-sentence him because of evidence placed before this Court that indicated that he was not serving his sentence in more difficult circumstances nor was he deprived of programmes to aid in his rehabilitation.

(5) It seems to me that the courts should now acknowledge the reality of the situation and reduce the range of discount to reflect the fact that one of the bases of the discount is no longer generally applicable. In my opinion discounts for a plea and assistance of more than 40 per cent should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted in a case where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population. It should now be accepted that an offender who has provided assistance will not necessarily be disadvantaged in the prison system and, if the offender wishes to assert otherwise, he or she should lead evidence of that fact. 

144In Mostyn v R [2004] NSWCCA 97; (2004) 145 A Crim R 304, what his Honour, with the agreement of McColl JA and Studdert J had said was:-

179 The material raises once again the issue of what mitigation of a sentence should be made on the basis that the offender might spend all or some of his sentence in protective custody. The matter has been recently considered in R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207 and R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299. It can no longer be assumed that a prisoner, by reason of the fact that he will serve his sentence on protection, will find prison life more difficult or onerous than other prisoners in the general prison population or that the prisoner will be deprived of amenities or opportunities for self improvement courses and education. The present is another instance where a sentencing judge has presumably taken into account in favour of the offender the fact that he will serve his sentence under the harsh conditions and deprivations of protective custody, but that has not proved to be the case. It is an example of the difficulty of a sentencing court taking into account possible executive or administrative action in respect of a prisoner's custody when predicting how a sentence will be served. Although in Durocher-Yvon the Court indicated that a sentencing judge was entitled to assume that an informer would find himself in strict protection for the best part, if not the whole, of his sentence, that assumption would have proved to be erroneous in the present case.

180 As was recognised in Totten, the court is placed in a difficult position. On the one hand, the sentencer should take into account the conditions of the prisoner's custody where it appears that they will be unduly onerous because of some matter particular to that prisoner. This requires that, at the time of sentence, the court make some prediction about the nature of the custody that will be endured by the prisoner. On the other hand, the courts should now be aware that assumptions or predictions, which have been made in the past about the nature of an offender's custody because, for example, the offender has given assistance to the authorities, no longer hold good. But the vagaries of prison life are such that it could never be confidently assumed or predicted that a prisoner will serve the whole of his sentence in any particular type of custodial arrangement.

145Howie J's remarks in R v Sukkar have been referred to in many cases since - see eg Brown v R [2010] NSWCCA 73; R v Choi [2010] NSWCCA 318 and R v Kumar & Feagaiga [2008] NSWCCA 328 where I cited them. However, my experience indicates that they should not be adopted uncritically. Too often have I been faced with evidence of prisoners on protection spending about 23 hours a day in their cells or allowed to see or communicate with but one or a few other prisoners. Certainly, I accept that not all prisoners on protection suffer significantly harsher conditions of imprisonment for all or most of their time in custody. However some, including the Respondent, certainly do.

146I accept also that one of the factors intended to be generally reflected in any discount for assistance are the anticipated harsher conditions of custody. However, in this case, the evidence indicates that the conditions experienced by the Respondent are significantly worse than usual for prisoners on protection. The danger to his and his family's life seems real. His assistance has had a substantial effect in motivating his own actions, to his disadvantage. When all of the relevant matters are taken into account, he should be entitled to a discount for assistance of the order of 35% of the undiscounted starting point, or, what is not precisely the same, 50% of that starting point discounted for the Respondent's plea. As to the latter percentage, see the references by Buddin J in SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [43] et seq. I make clear also that I do not ignore what was said in that case at [11] to the effect that ""an overall discount of more than 60%, however derived, will rarely, if ever, result in a sentence that is not manifestly inadequate"". However, I am satisfied that, in the unusual circumstances of this case it does not.

147I also do not ignore the terms of s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which, so far as is presently relevant, provides:-

(1) A Court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence

...

(3) A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

148Applied to the starting point of 12 years, the result of the discounts I favour would be that the sentence would be 4.8 or 4.5 years, periods which in my view are sufficient not to offend the terms of s 23(3). 

Conclusion

149What should be the result of all this? Except possibly on grounds of totality, there was no reasonable basis for his Honour to commence the Respondents sentence as early as 30 July so as to effectively reduce the sentence he was imposing by 6 months or, from another perspective, nullify the effect of the decision of the State Parole Authority to require the Respondent to serve the balance of parole under earlier sentences. His Honour erred also regarding the Respondent's offending as a ""consequence"" on meeting the gaol informant. A third error was in the relativity of the sentences on counts 2 and 3 although as his Honour did not err in the degree of concurrency and accumulation of these sentences with the sentence imposed on the first count, this error is not presently of significance.

150A fourth error was in using 8 years as the starting point for the sentence on count 1 although allowing only a 50% discount for the Respondent's plea and assistance reduced the significance of this error appreciably. Allowing only a 50% discount in arriving at the sentences for counts 2 and 3 may also have had the effect of increasing the sentence imposed for those offences to a minor degree.

151Had the commencing date of the first of the sentences Delaney DCJ imposed been at the end of the revoked period of parole, and the sentence on count 1 been the 4.8 years referred to above, the effective sentence would have been 1.3 years or something under 1 year 4 months longer than the 4 years 8 months that it was. It would not have been unreasonable for his Honour to have made the sentence on the first count 4.5 years and, either on grounds of totality or for the reasons referred to by Basten JA at [35], to have commenced the first of the sentences somewhat earlier than the end of the revoked period of control with the result that the sentence would have been something less than 1 year longer than the 4 years 8 months.

152These comparisons indicate that, although lenient, the overall sentence that was imposed was not so lenient that this Court is entitled to interfere.

153The Crown also submitted that undue leniency is apparent in the non-parole period and that in fixing that as he did, his Honour in effect double counted the value of assistance. On this topic I agree with the remarks of Basten JA at [44] - [52].

154In the result, without having to embark upon the question whether the appeal should be dismissed pursuant to the Court's residual discretion or because of the inadequacy of the information originally provided to the Court as to the degree to past assistance and benefits previously obtained - information which both parties were in a position to supply - I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.

155HALL J: I agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated by RS Hulme J.

		23 April 2012",2012-04-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759123,Khan v R [2012] NSWCCA 74,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  On 6 September 2010, at the conclusion of a trial in the District Court before Cogswell DCJ and a jury of 12, the jury found the applicant guilty of the following offence with which he and two co-accused had been charged and to which they had pleaded not guilty:
""On or about 4 September 2008, at Doonside, in the State of New South Wales, while in company with each other, [the accused] detained Maninder Singh without his consent and with the intention of holding him for ransom, and at the time of detaining in these circumstances, actual bodily harm was occasioned to Maninder Singh"" (s 86(3) Crimes Act 1900).
2The jury also found the co-accused, Mr Saurav Mahay and Mr Dushand Rana, guilty of the offence charged.
3On 11 November 2010 the trial judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a total term of four years and six months commencing on 9 September 2010, with a non-parole period of two years and eight months commencing on the same date.  
4The sole ground of appeal against his conviction that the applicant pressed at the hearing of the appeal was that the jury's verdict against him was unsafe and unsatisfactory.  As this ground of appeal does not raise ""a question of law alone"" (see s 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912), leave to appeal is required under s 5(1)(b) of that Act (Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]).
5In essence, the Crown's case against the applicant was as follows.  On the evening of 4 September 2008 the victim (""Maninder"") voluntarily accompanied the applicant's co-accused (to whom I shall refer as Saurav and Dushand) in a visit to the applicant's home.  After they had arrived, Maninder asked to leave but Saurav and Dushand told him that he would have to stay.  During the evening Maninder was taken to the backyard of the home where he was beaten by the co-accused in the presence of the applicant.  Maninder was told that he could not leave until $7,000 was paid to the co-accused.  He was threatened with a knife and detained at the applicant's home throughout the night.  Shortly before midnight, four friends of Maninder, including Mr Vikram Singh (""Vikram""), entered Blacktown Police Station and complained that Maninder was being held elsewhere against his will.  A number of telephone calls occurred thereafter between Vikram and those alleged to be detaining Maninder.  A number of these calls were received by Vikram whilst he was at the police station and were intercepted and recorded by the police.  At 11.55 am on 5 September 2008, the applicant rang Detective Senior Constable Camilleri at the police station and agreed to bring Maninder there by 12.30 pm.  This did not occur and at 1.10 pm in Westfield Shopping Centre car park, across the road from the police station, police stopped a vehicle in which the applicant, his co-accused and Maninder were travelling.  The applicant and his co-accused were arrested and subsequently charged with the offence for which they stood trial.
THE APPLICANT'S GROUND OF APPEAL
6The applicant's ground of appeal invokes the power and duty of this Court embodied in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to allow an appeal against conviction if the Court is of the opinion that the verdict of a jury should be set aside upon grounds that the verdict ""is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"", subject to the proviso that the Court may dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.  There will be little, if any, room for operation of the proviso where the verdict is found to be unreasonable or not supported by the evidence.  
7In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13, 243 CLR 400, French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ described the principles applicable to an appeal on this ground as follows:
""[11]  It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty'.
[12]  This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".
[13]  The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.  However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:
'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.'
...
[14]  In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'"" (references omitted).
8Later in their judgment French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ described the ""central question"" for the Court of Criminal Appeal as ""whether on the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the offences"" (at [20]).
9To determine this appeal in accordance with these principles, I have reviewed the whole of the evidence given at the trial.  I proceed to summarise that evidence insofar as it relates to this appeal.  As the trial took place over some 23 court days, my summary is necessarily far from exhaustive.  It is drawn largely from the Crown's 71 page Summary of Trial, the accuracy of which was accepted by counsel for the applicant.
THE CROWN CASE AT THE TRIAL
The evidence of Mr Maninder Singh, the victim
10Maninder gave evidence that he had come to Australia on a student visa which had been cancelled, but that he had obtained a bridging visa.
11He said that he lived in a house at Doonside with three friends, Gurvinder (also known as Gary), Gulab and Manjeet.  On the evening of 4 September 2008 another of his friends, Vikram, came to the house, as did Saurav and Dushand.  Saurav asked Maninder to come with him and Dushand to buy some alcohol.  Maninder agreed.  After the alcohol was bought, Saurav told him that the three of them would visit the home of his cousin (this being a reference to the applicant).  After their arrival there the three of them and the applicant sat in a car outside the applicant's home for 10 to 15 minutes.  During this time Maninder said to Dushand ""Let me go home"", to which Saurav replied ""You stay here with us tonight"".  Maninder then said ""I'm going to go back home"", to which one or more of the others replied ""You're not going home, you're going to stay here"".  The applicant lived at the home with his wife and child who were both at home on the night of 4 - 5 September 2008.
12Maninder's evidence was that he was then taken to the backyard of the applicant's home where Saurav and Dushand kicked him in the stomach and ""hit his face, his ear, his stomach and all his body"" (Transcript p 35 - 36).  Saurav and Dushand told him to give them $7,000.
13Maninder said that he was shouting ""help me, help me"" and that the beating continued for about 20 or 25 minutes during which time Dushand threatened him with a knife.  Saurav and Dushand said that they needed $7,000 from him and were going to call Maninder's father in India, presumably to demand the money.  They then told Maninder to telephone his friend Vikram in order to obtain the money.  They forced Maninder to tell Vikram that he (Maninder) was alright but needed $7,000.  Maninder was then taken into a shed in the backyard for about an hour.  After that, Saurav and Dushand took him into the house and he was forced to lie on a bed for the remainder of the night between Saurav and Dushand.
14Maninder initially said that he was not sure whether the applicant was inside or outside the house when he was taken to the backyard (Transcript p 33).  Maninder was also unable to recall the applicant's whereabouts when he was being beaten in the backyard (Transcript p 34).  When asked if others were present with Dushand and Saurav in the shed, Maninder said ""I'm not sure but I remember Saurav and [Dushand] were there.  I - I forget"" (Transcript p 45).  At this stage the Crown Prosecutor sought leave to use a record of a police interview with Maninder to revive his memory.  This leave was given later in the trial and the recording of the interview was played to Maninder in the absence of the jury.  In the presence of the jury, Maninder then gave evidence that the applicant was present when Saurav and Dushand beat him in the backyard and that the applicant was present with himself, Saurav and Dushand in the shed (Transcript pp 90 - 91).
15Maninder said that when he got out of bed the next morning, he could not walk because of the injuries that he had sustained the night before.  The applicant, his wife and child, Saurav, Dushand and Maninder remained at the house for one to two hours. Saurav and Dushand then told Maninder to call Vikram and tell him that they were going to Auburn Police Station (Vikram was in fact at Blacktown Police Station at the time) and ""they said like tell them lie, that you bashed by some other peoples, not from us"" (Transcript p 58).  Maninder said that he agreed to do so because he was ""really scared"".
16The applicant then drove to the Westpoint Shopping Centre car park with Maninder seated in the back with Saurav, and Dushand sitting in the front.  After they had parked, Dushand moved to the back of the car so that Maninder was positioned between himself and Saurav.  Saurav rang Vikram again, informing him that they were going to the city and intended to kill Maninder and throw him in the river.  After the car started moving, the police stopped it and arrested the applicant, Saurav and Dushand.
17In cross-examination Maninder agreed that the threats made towards him on the night of 4 September 2008 were in the Punjabi language but he denied that any discussion about money including numbers or the word ""thousand"" occurred only in Punjabi.  He maintained that they were spoken in English and Punjabi.  He agreed that the applicant did not at any stage speak in Punjabi.  
18Although Maninder initially denied that he had asked the applicant to lend him money, he later agreed that he had asked the applicant if he could help him with money.
19Maninder also agreed that the applicant did not physically touch him or threaten him and always treated him ""nicely"".  He did not complain to the applicant's wife about his injuries or seek her help.  
Mr Vikram Singh's evidence
20Vikram said that he is a distant cousin of Maninder.  He said that after Saurav and Dushand arrived at Maninder's house they said that they wished to speak to Maninder outside.  Vikram later saw them drinking alcohol whilst sitting in a car outside but when he returned later the car had gone.  About 15 minutes later Saurav rang him and said ""If you need your boy back we need $7,000 now"".  Vikram regarded the call as serious.  About an hour later Maninder called Vikram.  His voice was shaking and he could not speak clearly.  He said to Vikram ""please give them $7,000 and take me back"".
21Vikram decided to report the matter to the police and did so at Blacktown Police Station at about midnight.  About 12.15 am, whilst he was with the police, Vikram received a call from Saurav who asked if Vikram had made arrangements for the money to be provided.  About an hour later Maninder called Vikram to ask the same question.  Vikram said that they had only arranged $4,000.  Another hour later Maninder called again and asked how much they had arranged.  Vikram repeated that he had only $4,000.  Maninder replied ""It's okay, bring whatever you got"".  Vikram said that Maninder could not speak clearly and sounded like he was in pain.  Other calls were made the following morning.  With Vikram's concurrence, the police recorded eight calls.  The recordings of seven of these calls were tendered in evidence against the applicant. 
22Even when translated, the calls tendered against the applicant were difficult to understand.  However what can be discerned from the recordings tended to support Vikram's evidence.  In particular, the recordings indicated, consistently with Vikram's evidence, that Saurav was seeking money from Vikram, that Vikram said that he only had $4,000 and that Vikram feared that Maninder had been beaten.
Mr Rohit Sharma's evidence
23Mr Sharma is a friend of Maninder.  He gave evidence that on the evening of 4 September 2008 at Maninder's house, Dushand or Saurav asked Maninder to come outside to talk in the car.  Later Mr Sharma observed that Maninder, Saurav, Dushand and the car had gone.  He said that thereafter Vikram repeatedly called Saurav to ask about Maninder.  
Police and medical evidence
24Dr Ronald Dizon, a physician, was working in the Emergency Department at Blacktown Hospital on 5 September 2008 when Maninder was brought in.  He said that Maninder provided a history of an assault and possible head injury that caused a loss of consciousness.  After examining Maninder, Dr Dizon was satisfied that Maninder had a bruise surrounding his left eye, blood under the skin and concussion (Transcript pp 945 - 6).  The injuries were consistent with the history that he had been given.  He was not asked to express a view about how recent the injuries were.
25Detective Senior Constable Camilleri of Blacktown Police Station gave evidence that just before 1.00 am on 5 September 2008 he was told by other police officers at the station that a person named Maninder Singh was missing and that they were investigating suggestions that he may have been kidnapped by two male persons who were demanding a ransom of $7,000 for his return (Transcript p 930).  At about 11.55 am the following morning he received a telephone call from the applicant who said that a friend of his had reported that Maninder was missing.  The applicant said that Maninder was with him and was fine.  Detective Camilleri asked the applicant to bring Maninder to the police station at 12.30 pm and the applicant agreed.
26Detective Camilleri said that later in the day he saw Maninder and observed that he had ""bruising and swelling around his left eye and cheek, two red scratches on the left side of his forehead while his left ear was very swollen and purple in colour"" (Transcript p 1028).  Maninder complained that his stomach was sore and that Dushand and Saurav ""did this"".  Maninder said that the applicant was present when he was assaulted by Dushand and Saurav (Transcript p 1030).
27Detective Camilleri also gave evidence that Constable Allison had found in a car located at the applicant's premises the empty packaging for two paring knives and a receipt from Blacktown Woolworths for these items dated 4 September 2008 and timed at 18.33.
28Detective Brennan gave evidence that at about 1.15 pm on 5 September 2008 in the Westpoint Shopping Centre car park he arrested the applicant for kidnapping.  He found a piece of cardboard in the applicant's jacket pocket with Maninder's mobile phone number written on it.  Also written on the cardboard was a reference to an amount of $7,000, or more, with the numbers of hundreds and tens of dollars indistinct.  The number of thousands (seven) however was clear.  Detective Brennan observed that Maninder had some swelling and bruising around his left eye.  
29Senior Constable Fishlock, who was also present at the arrest, observed that Maninder had a bruised left eye, swelling and redness to his left ear and the left side of his head, and heavy breathing.  Constable Fishlock said that Maninder was complaining about his stomach and that he formed the view that Maninder required an ambulance.
30Constable Singh, who was present when Maninder was brought to Blacktown Police Station, said that one side of Maninder's face was swollen, that he could hardly speak and that he complained about pain behind his neck and swollen ribs.  Maninder said to Constable Singh ""they bashed me a lot last night and they have threatened that they will stab me if the money is not delivered"" (Transcript pp 625 - 630).
31Detective Senior Constable Harris, who was also present at the arrest, observed that Maninder appeared very distressed and in a considerable amount of pain.  
32Detective Senior Sergeant Kelly was present at Blacktown Police Station when Vikram and three others arrived at about 12.05 am on 5 September 2008.  Vikram told Detective Kelly that he needed help because his cousin Maninder had been kidnapped and they wanted $7,000 ""or they will kill him"".  
33Detective Kelly gave evidence that thereafter Vikram received a number of calls on his mobile.
The recorded interview with the applicant
34The Crown tendered the recording of an interview of the applicant by the police (Exhibit J).  The jury was given a printed, edited transcript (MFI 34) to read whilst the recording was played in court.
35The applicant said in the interview that Dushand, Saurav and Maninder all spoke a common language which the applicant thought was Indian, with the dialect being Punjabi.  When asked whether he spoke any languages besides English, the applicant said that he spoke eight languages:
""I speak Arabic, I speak Urdu, I speak Hindi, I speak Punjab, not that Punjabi, Fijian, English, Indo-Fijian and Afghan"" (Q & A 404).
It is not clear what the applicant meant when he answered ""I speak Punjab, not that Punjabi"".  He proceeded to say that he did not so much speak Punjabi as understand it but then said that he had intended in his earlier answer to refer to another language, Gujarat, rather than Punjabi.  When pressed about whether he could understand Punjabi he said ""maybe a word here and there.  It's like Pidgin English to me"" with certain words in common with words he knew (Q & A 398 - 411).  He said that Dushand, Saurav and Maninder spoke together in Punjabi ""99 per cent of the time"" but when the applicant was present they would ""throw in"" some English and Hindi.  When the applicant was asked why he ""backtracked"" from saying confidently that he spoke Punjabi, he said that when he was in the group (on 4 - 5 September 2008) he merely pretended that he knew how to speak it (Q & A 418 - 450).
36The applicant denied that Maninder was held against his will at the applicant's home and that money was demanded for his release.  He also denied knowledge of any assaults on Maninder.  He said that one reason Maninder was at the applicant's house that night was that ""basically he was asking for my help, financial help"" (Q & A 442) and that during the evening Maninder pestered the applicant for money.  The applicant said that Maninder told him that he had been assaulted a couple of days earlier.  The applicant did not notice any injuries to Maninder other than some redness on the morning of 5 September.
37The applicant said that the piece of cardboard found in his pocket said on one side ""$7,170 minus $1,000"" and that the applicant had written this whilst the group was in the shed in his backyard.  He said that those present had had an issue with some monies and that they were talking about what their share was.  He said that the others were basically talking amongst themselves and that the applicant was trying to scribble down what was said because he could not make sense of it.
THE CASE FOR THE APPLICANT
38The applicant did not give evidence but his wife did.  
Mrs Khan's evidence
39Mrs Khan gave evidence that she lived with the applicant and their seven-year old son.  She said that she and her son were at home on the night of 4 - 5 September 2008.  In the evening she heard voices coming from the shed in the backyard but she could not understand the language being spoken.  When she got up in the middle of the night she walked past the spare room and saw through the open door that there were three people in the bed.
40The next morning she was introduced to Maninder and did not observe any injuries that he had.  She was shown a photograph of Maninder's face taken on the day after she saw him at her house.  She said that she did not see his face looking like that.
41She said that when she was at Blacktown Police Station for the purpose of being interviewed she heard Detective Camilleri saying to Maninder that he must remember to involve the applicant in the case and Maninder responding ""but [the applicant] hasn't done anything to me"" (Transcript p 1143).
42In cross-examination she said that even though she talked to Maninder she had only looked at him briefly as ""in our culture we can't just look at the man straight into their face like that for any length of time, so I would be talking to him, but not like staring right at him like that"" (Transcript pp 1155 - 6).
THE CASE FOR THE CO-ACCUSED DUSHAND
43Dushand said that whilst he was at Maninder's home on 4 September 2008 he told Maninder that he and Saurav were going to buy some more drinks and that Maninder said that he would go with them and show them a nearby liquor shop.  Dushand told Maninder that they also had to go to a friend's place to plan his birthday party and Maninder accepted that.  During the drive, Maninder asked if Dushand could lend him some money.  Dushand said that he could not but that he would ask his ""brother"".  Dushand was referring to the applicant whom he regarded as a brother. 
44Dushand denied that Maninder was detained against his will and that any money was demanded to secure his liberty.  He denied that Maninder was assaulted on the night of 4 - 5 September 2008 and said that any injuries Maninder had were the result of a fight he had been involved in two days earlier.
THE APPLICANT'S SUBMISSIONS ON APPEAL
45The applicant's submissions included the following:
""18.  The Crown case was circumstantial.  There was no direct evidence of guilt.  There are other hypotheses consistent with innocence.  Amongst those is that the [Applicant] merely agreed to [Saurav], [Dushand] and [Maninder] staying at his residence overnight and when informed of the suggestion that [Maninder] was being detained he was in transit to the Police Station when arrested.
19.  Even if the evidence is considered to be such that a conviction could occur it is nevertheless a situation where the conviction should not occur.  The Crown case is flimsy, at best, and there are alternate hypotheses consistent with innocence.  The Court should have at least the doubt referred to in M v R"" (Applicant's Written Submissions).
46The applicant's counsel submitted that the figure on the piece of cardboard found in his possession was $7,100 and that ""this was never a figure which was in any manner associated with the ransom demands"".
47The applicant also submitted that his failure to go directly to the police station after he had spoken to Detective Camilleri was immaterial given that it was he who contacted the police after learning that they were looking for Maninder.
DISPOSITION OF APPEAL
48As noted earlier (see [7] - [8]), this Court's task is not simply to determine whether there was evidence capable of supporting the jury's verdict.  The Court must also satisfy itself of the applicant's guilt.  It is however necessary to recognise that the jury had the advantage over the course of a long trial of seeing and hearing the witnesses give evidence and it is clear from its verdict that it rejected both the applicant's account of events (contained in the recording of his interview) and that of his co-accused Dushand.  Furthermore, the jury found no reason based upon its observation of the Crown witnesses to reject the material parts of their evidence.  Taking these matters into account, my view, after reviewing the evidence, is that the Crown proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the applicant committed the offence of which he was convicted.
49The following evidence is particularly significant in this respect.
50The evidence of Maninder, if accepted, left no room for any reasonable doubt that the applicant, although not the prime actor in the events that occurred, was present during and facilitated the acts of Saurav and Dushand in detaining Maninder, assaulting him and demanding payment for his release.  The events in question occurred in the applicant's presence at his home or in a car that he was driving.  He took no steps to dissent from what occurred and by his presence, the provision of his home and his driving of the car, he participated in the offending conduct.
51There was considerable evidence that supported Maninder's version of events.  In particular, there was the evidence of Vikram concerning calls from Saurav requesting ransom money (see [20] - [22] above) and the evidence of various police officers and Dr Dizon of Blacktown Hospital as to the physical injuries suffered by Maninder and observed immediately after the conclusion of his detention (see [24] - [33] above).  Furthermore, the complaints by Maninder of which the police witnesses gave evidence were consistent with the evidence that Maninder gave of his alleged detention and the assaults on him.
52Support for Maninder's evidence was also provided by the recordings of telephone calls made by the police and tendered against the applicant (see [22] above).  Additionally, the piece of cardboard found in the applicant's possession which he admitted in his police interview that he wrote on, provided further evidence that a sum of $7,000, or at least a figure in that vicinity, was spoken of during the period of the alleged detention.  The note on the piece of cardboard of Maninder's mobile phone number added strength to this evidence.
53Vikram's action in attending the police station, with his friends, to report the detention and the demands for money provided strong support for his evidence.  Mr Rohit Sharma's evidence also supported the initial part of Vikram's evidence concerning the departure of Maninder, Saurav and Dushand from Maninder's home and Vikram's telephone conversations thereafter with Saurav concerning Maninder (see [23] above).
54In my view, contrary to the applicant's submission (see [45] above), no alternative hypothesis consistent with the applicant's innocence was open on the evidence.  The jury's obvious acceptance of the evidence of Maninder and Vikram was overwhelmingly supported by the evidence at the trial taken as a whole.

2759124,Alameddine v R [2012] NSWCCA 63,"Judgment

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Grove AJ. 

2Johnson J: I agree with Grove AJ.

3Grove AJ: The appellant was convicted on two counts of aggravated armed robbery after a trial at Parramatta District Court before Colefax DCJ and a jury. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 10 years with a non-parole period of seven years. These were directed to commence on 29 September 2013 which date was 12 months prior to the expiry of a non-parole period for other offences dealt with at Sydney District Court on 11 June 2010. 

4The central issue at trial was the identity of the appellant as one of the offenders who robbed two Armaguard security officers at about 12:50 pm on 8 September 2008 as they were leaving a Coles supermarket at Guildford. Over $140,000 in cash was taken as well as, from each officer, a loaded .38 calibre firearm. Count one of the indictment charged robbery of one officer (Morris) of cash and a firearm whilst count two charged robbery of the firearm from the other officer (Czlazko). 

5At about 4:30 pm on Sunday 7 September 2008 the owner of a red Nissan Pulsar, registered number WIG822, left it outside her house at Greenacre. At 8:30 am on 8 September she observed that it was missing and she reported this to police a few minutes later.

6Prior to 12:50 pm on that day a white Honda Euro belonging to the appellant's brother, Saleh Alameddine, was parked by him across the road from the Coles store at Guildford. He got out of the driver seat and walked around and sat in the passenger seat.

7An Armaguard vehicle occupied by Mr Morris and Mr Czlazko arrived at about 12:45 pm. The stolen Nissan WIG822 arrived soon afterwards. It had three occupants. Two males with their faces concealed alighted from the front and rear passenger doors while the driver remained in his position. For convenience, those who alighted have been referred to as offender A and offender B respectively. The Crown alleges that the appellant was offender A.

8Offender A was armed with a pistol and he used it to threaten Mr Morris who retreated into the store, however, offender A followed and, pointing the pistol at Mr Morris, directed him to lie on the ground which he did thus enabling the offender to take a cash bag and the guard's pistol. Offender B threatened Mr Czlazko with a sawn off shotgun and forced him also to lie on the ground enabling him to take the guard's firearm from its holster.

9Both offenders returned to the places that they had previously occupied in the Nissan which was then driven away at speed. 

10Much of what has just been described was captured on CCTV cameras positioned in the Armaguard vehicle, the Coles store and a pharmacy outside which the white Honda Euro had been parked. 

11At about 1:00 pm a witness saw two cars enter a parking area of a unit complex in Guildford. She saw one car, a white one, then leave very quickly and noticed its number plate was covered by a jacket. When she went to the carpark where rubbish bins were located she noticed the second car which she recognised as not belonging to any resident in the building. Her son-in-law lived in a different unit from her but in the same complex and she went there and told him what she had seen. At about 2 pm he went to have a look and saw Nissan WIG822 and noticed, inter alia, a smashed rear quarter window and damaged ignition. He rang police who arrived within a few minutes. Thereafter the vehicle was secured by police for subsequent examination. 

12On the day following the robbery the registration of the white Honda Euro belonging to the appellant's brother was changed. There was evidence that he was arrested in February 2009 and ""charged with offences in connection with this robbery"" to which, by the time of the appellant's trial, he had pleaded guilty. 

13On 20 February 2009 police executed search warrants at two different premises. That executed at Auburn related to a family home at which both the appellant and his brother Saleh ordinarily resided. Nothing implicating the appellant in the robbery was discovered there. The other warrant was executed at Chester Hill, the address of the appellant's sister Renee and her husband. At this address police seized a white hooded jacket later determined to bear DNA of the appellant as well as other unidentified persons. Also seized was a single live .38 calibre Winchester cartridge stained with a green primer at its base and an Optus mobile phone account for January 2009 in the name of the appellant. These items were found in the same room of the house although the cartridge was locked in a combination safe. The other item connected to the appellant found at this address was an unopened telephone account in an envelope upon which some writing had been endorsed.

14In the meantime, among other items sent for examination, a forensic biologist determined that a swab taken from the front door handle on the passenger side of the Nissan vehicle revealed the same DNA profile in the profiler plus system as the DNA profile of the appellant.

15The circumstantial case relied upon by the Crown was recapitulated by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury in these terms:

""Now, the Crown relies upon ten circumstances to establish its case, and you heard Mr Crown identify them for you this morning. I will remind you of what they are. First, the robberies of Nathan Morris of firearm and money, and of Alexander Czlazko of a firearm on 8 September. Secondly, the use of a stolen maroon coloured Nissan Pulsar motor vehicle in those robberies. Thirdly, the CCTV footage and stills showing the robberies and the robbers. Fourth, the physical description of the robbers and their clothing as given by witnesses at the scene. Fifth, the DNA evidence in relation to the interior doorhandle on the front passenger side of the stolen motor vehicle. Sixth, the short timeframe in which there was said to be an opportunity for the DNA of the accused to have been placed on the interior doorhandle of the front passenger seat. Seventhly, the DNA evidence in relation to the hooded jacket found at 94 Priam Street on 24 February 2009. Eighth, the question of whether the hooded jacket is the one shown on the CCTV footages from the robberies as being worn by the robber when he gets out of the front passenger door of the car. Ninthly, the bullet or the cartridge found in the safe at 94 Priam Street. And tenth, evidence implicating the accused's brother insofar as it establishes a close connection between him and the accused.""

16The appellant relies upon four grounds of appeal. Ground 1 asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to exclude the evidence of items found at the home of the appellant's sister five and a half months after the offence and DNA evidence related to those items. 

17The items consisted of the two telephone accounts, the cartridge and the hooded jacket. The fact in issue was the identity of the appellant as offender A. The question was whether the evidence, that is the tender of these items, could rationally bear on that fact: Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650; Phillips v The Queen (2005) 225 CLR 303; Stubley v Western Australia (2011) 85 ALJR 435.

18The occupants of the house at Chester Hill were not called but had explained the presence of the appellant's telephone accounts to police on the basis that his sister as a matter of convenience paid his bills at the Post Office which was next door. The contention of the prosecution was that the presence of these items in his sister's house demonstrated his connection with those premises and hence with the two other allegedly incriminating items found there namely, the hooded jacket and the cartridge. The telephone accounts could not, of course, bear upon the identity of the appellant as an offender in the robbery in September 2008. 

19The evidence showed that it was the practice of Armaguard to stain the ammunition issued to its guards in different colours on a three-year cycle. At the end of the year, the ammunition was collected and the new ammunition stained with the colour of the year distributed in exchange. The colour of the year for 2008 was green. The cartridge seized at Chester Hill was identifiable as Armaguard ammunition for 2008, hence it was argued that the circumstance that the firearms were taken in the September robbery pointed to a source of the cartridge, its possession by the robbers and hence by the appellant as one of them. 

20Fundamental to the availability of the finding of the cartridge as a circumstance towards identifying the appellant as such a robber was a nexus between him and that item. The cartridge was extracted from a locked safe which was opened at police direction by the appellant's brother-in-law who claimed that he had found it while on a trip in the country some time after Christmas 2008. A witness from Armaguard acknowledged that, during the year in which the green marked ammunition was on issue, there had been other incidents as well as the robbery at Guildford in which firearms had been taken and it was calculated that there were some 72 green marked cartridges unaccounted for.

21There was no evidence that the appellant was aware of the combination needed to unlock the safe nor any evidence that he had had access to this safe otherwise. The telephone account was not in the safe.

22The compatibility of the seized cartridge and the ammunition in the firearms seized from the guards presented a risk of prejudicial speculation concerning the identification of a robber and there was no rational basis upon which the circumstances of its finding could bear upon identifying the appellant as such. 

23The other seized item was the hooded jacket. On the chest area there was printed a large impression of a monkey. The product of the CCTV cameras showed that the jacket worn by offender A displayed no such impression and it was the prosecution contention that it had been worn in reverse. I shall later refer to some other detail of the jacket and what can be seen on the photography, but I turn now to the circumstances in which the jacket was seized.

24The jacket was found on the floor near baskets of washing. After seizure it was sent for examination and a swab from the inside right wrist cuff disclosed the presence of DNA which had a profile matching that of the appellant. Swabs from the outside right wrist cuff and the back of the neck produced DNA from at least three individuals. The analyst could not identify the appellant as a contributor but neither could he be ruled out as one of them.

25The search by police was video recorded and the disk was in evidence. At the close of the Crown case a submission was made that there should be a directed acquittal. In his judgment rejecting this submission, the learned trial judge considered the evidence concerning the jacket and said:

""In the course of the trial, exhibit AB was tendered which consists three compact discs recording the search which discovered that garment. That disc recorded the accused's sister saying that the garment was part of the family washing and indeed the accused's brother-in-law said it had come out of the dryer. 

The expert witness called by the Crown conceded in cross-examination that if the garment had been washed in the five and a half month period between the robbery and the search then it was more likely than not that the DNA would have been placed on the garment after the washing. There is, therefore, evidence of washing and the concession which the expert made, I think really rules out as a matter of significance in this trial the DNA found on the garment.""

26Although he had made these remarks in that judgment, in the portion of his charge to the jury extracted above, he did not withdraw from consideration as the seventh of the ten circumstances relied upon by the Crown ""the DNA evidence in relation to the hooded jacket"".

27Later in relation to this item he gave this explicit direction:

""Then you might wish to consider question item 7, and that is the significance of the DNA, if that be the jacket, found at Priam Street. Now, this issue is also a link in the chain issue. Miss Neville gave evidence of the strong correlation between the DNA profile of the accused with what was found on that jacket. It was, you have been reminded, found five and a half months after the robbery. She told you it could have been placed there, that is the DNA could have been placed there any time between September and February. But she said it would have to have been placed there later in time if at any stage it had been washed in that five and a half months. Now, before you could use that fact, that is that it was the accused who wore the jacket on 8 September, you would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no other reasonable explanation for the presence of the DNA on the jacket.""

28Given his Honour's finding as to the ruling out of the significance of the DNA on the jacket when determining the directed verdict application, it is difficult to conclude other than that, if it be assumed that the finding of the jacket retained some probative value, that value must inevitably have been outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant and the evidence should have been withdrawn from the jury in accordance with the mandate in s 137 of the Evidence Act. It was five and a half months since the robbery and the seized jacket was with washing and, as commented by the appellant's brother-in-law to police, was awaiting ironing; it was not only the appellant's DNA on the jacket and, as will later be observed, there were apparent incompatibilities between the markings on this jacket and what could be seen on the jacket worn by offender A as captured on the CCTV images. 

29I would uphold ground 1.

30Ground 2 contends that the trial miscarried by virtue of the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury adequately as to the proper use of the DNA evidence in the trial.

31In the light of my conclusion that the evidence concerning the DNA on the jacket should have been withdrawn from the jury, it will suffice to deal briefly with this ground.

32At the time the jacket was seized there were found in the pockets some pieces of material and black gloves. During the search, the appellant's brother-in-law had said these were his. Whether or not this be accepted, it was common ground that these were not of relevance to the robbery and, in particular, to the identity of offender A who was depicted on the CCTV product as wearing white or, at least very light coloured, gloves.

33If, contrary to the view that I have expressed in relation to ground 1, the DNA evidence in relation to the jacket remained for consideration by the jury then a similar result should have been achieved by direction that the inference being invited by the prosecutor, namely that the DNA had been placed on it in September 2008 and had remained there undisturbed, unwashed and undegraded until February 2009, could not safely be drawn by the jury: cf Mahmood v State of Western Australia (2008) 232 CLR 397.

34It is also complained that no direction concerning the items found in the pockets of the jacket had been given. There had been no suggestion that these items were available to assist in the identification of the appellant and in the conduct of the trial this must have been obvious to the jury which offers a reasonable explanation as to why no application for direction was made. I would not regard this omission as demonstrative of error. 

35However in regard to the DNA found on the jacket, for the reasons above expressed, I would uphold ground 2.

36Ground 3 proposes that the trial miscarried by virtue of the trial judge failing to answer a question from the jury prior to taking majority verdicts from the jury in circumstances where the unanswered question asked by the jury related to the material issues in the trial, namely: ""How much weight can be given in reference to joint criminal enterprise in regard to using the DNA evidence from the interior door handle of the car to implicate the accused for robbery?"".

37It is accepted that his Honour did not answer this inquiry but it provides an understanding of how this did not occur to chronicle some events during the jury deliberations.

38The jury retired to consider its verdict at 3:22 pm on Thursday 21 October 2010. They ceased at about 4 pm and resumed at 9:40 am on 22 October. Some time before 11 am the jury sent a note indicating their difficulty in reaching agreement. After discussion with counsel, his Honour gave the jury a brief exhortation broadly adopting some of the suggestions in Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44. At 1 pm the jury sent a further note repeating that they were having difficulty in obtaining agreement and suggesting that they would be unable so to do.

39Discussion then ensued between his Honour and counsel concerning the taking of a majority verdict. Whilst this was taking place, the note which is set out in the ground of appeal was received. 

40Discussion then turned as to what the jury was seeking by this note. As the Crown case was that the appellant was offender A whose DNA was on the door handle, the reference to joint criminal enterprise does suggest that they were concerned about the second count charging the robbery of Mr Czlazko but it was wise to seek clarification which his Honour did when he had the jury brought back at about 2:10 pm. Thereafter the jury retired with a request to try and redraft the question.

41No redrafted note was received but another note was sent stating that the jury ""had finished deliberating"". At 3:13 pm his Honour brought the jury back and pointed to the ambiguity in the message last received and asked them to confirm whether they had reached a unanimous verdict. This received a negative response.

42Thereafter, evidence was taken from a juror attesting to the unlikelihood of agreement and, after findings in accordance with s 55C of the Jury Act, at 3:21 pm his Honour gave a direction incorporating more fully the suggestions in Black and directing them of their capacity to deliver a verdict by majority of 11 jurors. 

43At 3:39 pm the jury returned majority verdicts of guilty on both counts. 

44As above stated, the jury note described in the ground was not answered nor, however, did the jury return a redraft of this inquiry as requested. That request had emerged upon his Honour's expressed inability to understand what he was being asked. Neither counsel offered any interpretation of the note and they agreed to a proposal that the jury be asked to clarify what it was that they seeking, hence his Honour's request for a redraft. 

45There is ample authority that a verdict should not be taken until a request for direction has been fulfilled: R v McCormack (1986) 85 A Crim R 445. Where a question manifests confusion, it is important that this be removed and the jury be directed along the correct path. Even if, absent direction, a jury has resolved an issue to their own satisfaction, it has been held erroneous to omit so to do: R v Salama [1999] NSWCCA 105.

46It is perhaps understandable how the obtaining of the requested redraft of the question was overlooked, given the focus of the series of communications from the jury concerning its inability to agree but the omission amounted to error. Even where the directions in the initial charge are adequate, it has been held that they no longer remain so in the light of the existence of an unanswered question: R v Hickey (2002) 137 A Crim R 62.

47Ground 3 should be upheld.

48Ground 4 contends that verdicts are unreasonable having regard to the evidence in the trial. 

49The approach to be taken by this Court when such a ground is raised was expressed in the majority judgment in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 in these words:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.""

50This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act so that the reference to ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" is to be taken as equivalent to the statutory formula that the impugned verdict is ""unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"": MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606. 

51It becomes the duty of this Court to make its independent assessment of the evidence in order to answer the question posed in M. This has been stressed in a series of judgments Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510; The Queen v Chamberlain (No 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521; Morris v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 454 and relatively recently in SKA v The Queen (2011) 243 CLR 400.

52In SKA, the majority (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) quoted with approval the further extract from the judgment in M, viz:

"".....the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"".

53Their Honours went on to observe (at [20]) that it would be erroneous for this court to approach such a task by concerning itself whether, as a question of law, there was evidence to support a verdict, rather than making its own independent assessment of the evidence. Thus, the court should approach the question, whether on the evidence the court is satisfied that the offender is guilty of the offence, as the central question and not as an ancillary question to whether there was a sufficiency of evidence to sustain the conviction.

54The joint judgment added (at [21]):

""To determine satisfactorily the applicant's appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to determine whether the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged.""

55In discussing this principle and its application, Mason CJ in Chidiac v The Queen (1991) 71 CLR 432 at 433 made these observations:

""It is for the court to consider whether, on the relevant evidence, it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused"" and ""in making that assessment, the Court must necessarily take into account the nature and quality of the evidence...""

56In the light of my opinion that ground 1 should be sustained, it follows that the evidence concerning the jacket and the cartridge seized at Chester Hill was neither relevant nor of appropriate quality to contribute to the identification of the appellant as offender A and therefore to the finding of guilt. It should be excluded from assessment as to whether the jury, acting reasonably, should have entertained a reasonable doubt; Chidiac at 443. 

57Understandably, at the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the appellant drew attention to inconsistencies between the seized jacket and what could be observed about the jacket worn by offender A as seen in the product of the CCTV cameras including still images extracted from the video recordings. For example, when reversed, the jacket displays a black line across the shoulders which, it was contended, was not visible on any of the images. That appears to be the case, however another stripe across the hood is visible in some images and not in others. It was submitted that comparisons would contradict the proposition that the seized jacket was identifiable as that worn by offender A. In addition submissions were also directed to the absence of nexus between the appellant and the cartridge and its asserted irrelevancy to the identification of the appellant.

58It becomes unnecessary to recapitulate these arguments or to determine debate about them because, in the vernacular, no better outcome could be achieved by the appellant than the exclusion of this evidence which will be the consequence if ground 1 is sustained. 

59It remains, however, for this Court to make an assessment based upon the admissible evidence. 

60In an exchange between counsel and the bench, it was conceded that the appellant could have been convicted on the evidence of finding of his DNA on the passenger door handle of the stolen car used to convey the offenders to and from the robbery alone. In making assessment in this Court it is not, of course, sufficient merely to find that there was evidence sufficient to enable the jury to convict: Chamberlain (No 2) at 531; Morris at 473.

61The identity of the appellant's DNA on the door handle of the car does not stand in isolation. In the absence of any other explanation, it would rationally follow that the DNA was deposited between 4:30 pm on Sunday 7 September or when the owner left her car and 1 pm on the following day when it was abandoned just minutes after the robbery. There is a clear available inference that the Nissan car was stolen for the express purpose of being used in the robbery and the limited time-frame during which DNA from a person otherwise unconnected with the vehicle could be deposited and the contemporaneity of such deposit with the possession of it by the robbers and its use in the offence add circumstances to the identification of the appellant's DNA reasonably capable of pointing to his inculpation. These circumstances are to be considered in deciding whether or not the contention of the appellant has been made good: cf Halmi v R [2008] NSWCCA 259; Chahine v R [2006] NSWCCA 179.

62It is true that the forensic biologist who identified the DNA acknowledged that she could not exclude the DNA of the appellant being on the door handle by ""secondary transfer"" but this concession was entirely hypothetical and there was not the slightest evidence of any mechanism whereby such a transfer might have been effected. In any event, given the amount of DNA recovered, the witness testified that the results were more consistent with direct transfer. I recognise that in his charge, his Honour said to the jury that one way secondary transfer could have occurred was if the appellant's DNA was on a pair of gloves which he had previously touched but were worn by somebody else who was actually in the car. As I have said, this derived from submission which was pure speculation but to the extent that it was erroneous to advance such unsustainable theory, it could have only operated to advantage of the appellant that that direction was given. 

63As already noted, the critical fact to be established was the identity of the appellant as offender A and in the whole of the circumstances surrounding the theft and use of the Nissan car and the existence of the DNA of the appellant on the door handle of that door by which offender A left and entered the car, I would assess the evidence as factually supportive of the guilt of the appellant and I do not conclude that it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand. That conclusion is, of course, related to this ground of appeal and not the grounds which I have indicated that I would uphold. It follows also that I would answer the question as formulated in M, in the affirmative. 

64I would reject ground 4. In her written submissions counsel of the appellant accepted that if any or all of grounds 1, 2 and 3 were upheld but ground 4 was rejected, the appropriate order would be to direct a new trial. That concession was correct and I would so order.

65I propose the following orders:

1.Appeal allowed.
2.Convictions and sentences quashed.
3.New trial ordered.

		20 May 2013",2012-04-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759130,JAD v R [2012] NSWCCA 73,"Judgment

1WHEALY JA: JAD (the appellant) was found guilty by a jury at the Orange District Court on 18 August 2009 in relation to an indictment containing six counts. Each count related to a sexual offence which was perpetrated upon the daughter of the appellant's de facto partner. The Crown alleged that, on each occasion, the appellant was the perpetrator. I shall refer to the young woman as the complainant. The appellant appeals his conviction on the following grounds:

(1)  the convictions in respect of counts 5 and 6 (s 73(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) cannot be supported by the evidence; 

(2)  in respect of each of the convictions, a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by one or more of the following; 

(a)  the admission of tendency evidence contrary to s 97 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW); 

(b)  defence counsel's failure to rely on s 293(4)(c) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW); 

(c)  defence counsel's failure to request a warning as to the unreliability of the complainant's evidence (s 165(c) Evidence Act), and the trial judge's failure to give such a direction; and/or

(d)  defence counsel's failure to request a direction under s 165B Evidence Act, and the trial judge's failure to give such a direction. 

Ground 1 is not contested by the Crown

2On his arraignment before the jury on 10 August 2009 the appellant was charged with two counts under s 73(1) Crimes Act that he, between 1 and 25 March 2008, had sexual intercourse with the complainant who was then sixteen years old and ""under the care of (the appellant) by reason of he then being her stepfather"". These were counts 5 and 6 in the indictment. 

3Section 73(3) Crimes Act relevantly provides that, for the purposes of the section, a person (""the victim"") is under the special care of another person (""the offender"") if, and only if: 

""(a)the offender is the step-parent, guardian or foster-parent of the victim.""

4It appears that the Crown had chosen to indict in this way for counts 5 and 6, as clearly the complainant was aged over 16 and the Crown had not sought to establish, within the trial, a lack of consent. It would have been possible for the Crown to have indicted these counts as offences pursuant to s 61L Crimes Act 1900 and to have sought to establish lack of consent. It did not do so. It is to be assumed that the Crown believed that it could establish that the complainant was the step-daughter of the appellant. 

5At the end of the evidence, the appellant's legal representative pointed out that, as the accused and the complainant's mother had never married, the 2 charges could not be sustained against the applicant. The Crown prosecutor sought to save the situation by making an application to amend the indictment to substitute the term ""foster-parent"" for ""step-parent"". It appears to have been accepted that the decision of this Court in R v Miller [2001] NSWCCA 209;(2001) 127 A Crim R 344 required a finding that the applicant could not properly be categorised as the stepfather of the complainant. This was despite the fact that the appellant had been living with the complainant's mother since the complainant was nine years of age. 

6The trial judge ruled that the indictment should be amended to delete the word ""stepfather"" from counts 5 and 6 and to insert the words ""foster-parent"". 

7On this appeal Ms Janet Manuell SC, for the appellant, has argued that a de facto partner cannot, without more, properly be characterised under the Crimes Act as the foster-parent of a child. Senior counsel has moulded her argument against the provisions of the Adoption Act 2000 (NSW) and the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 (NSW). The argument advanced is that there was no evidence at trial to establish that the complainant had ever been under the daily care and control ""of the appellant"" in an out of home care arrangement made under the Adoption Act. Further, it was argued that although the term ""foster-parent"" is not defined in the Crimes Act 1900, the legislature did not contemplate that the expression would extend, without more, to the situation where a couple were living in a de facto relationship together with the child of one of the people in that relationship. 

8The Crown's submissions were advanced by Mr John Pickering of counsel. He submitted that a common sense approach would suggest that a de facto partner is not ""a foster-parent"". He suggested that, in its natural meaning, a foster-parent is a person who assists in raising children in circumstances where neither of the natural parents can take care of them. 

9The Crown, before this Court, initially conceded the correctness of Ms Manuell's position. It examined the various definitions of the expression ""foster-parent"" in the Collins Concise Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary. The Crown had argued in written submissions that the concept of including foster-parents in s 73 (in the 2003 amendments), although not explained, was likely to be designed to cover situations where children were fostered out to homes in which neither of their natural parents resided. That fostering agreement, the Crown argued, may not need to have been done by any legal act or formal legal agreement, but it must at least have been a situation whereby the victim is being cared for by a person or persons, neither of whom is the natural parent. 

10The Crown made it abundantly clear that it did not seek to support the attempts of the Crown prosecutor and trial judge in the present matter to 'shoe horn' the facts to fit the definition of ""foster-parent"". In his written submissions, the Crown had said:

""43. There is no prospect that the Crown can resist ground 1 of this appeal.""

11In these circumstances, as I have said, the Crown initially accepted that it should not stand against this ground of appeal (a similar concession was made in relation to ground 2(b) which I shall deal with shortly). In addition, the Crown had also accepted that the present appeal was not a case where the implementation of the proviso would be appropriate, despite the impressive evidence of the complainant, and the obvious acceptance of her by the jury as a truthful witness. The respondent's submission was that this Court should uphold grounds 1 and 2(b) an order a new trial.

12However, as Simpson J has pointed out, after some ""discussion"" with the Court, the Crown later withdrew its concession in relation to ground 1, but offered no argument beyond that contained in its written submissions. The Crown accepted the consequence that, if its initial concession on that ground had been correctly made, the proper order would be an acquittal on counts 5 and 6, with a new trial being ordered on the remaining counts in the indictment.

A concession is made in relation to ground 2(b)

13The Crown conceded that a second significant error occurred in the proceedings. At trial the Crown prosecutors placed great reliance on the psychological condition of the complainant especially from 2006 onwards. There was evidence from the complainant's mother that she was at times very anxious and depressed. There was evidence from Melissa Roberts, a psychologist, who treated the complainant from February 2007 onwards. After treatment for some time, in May 2008, the complainant had disclosed to the psychologist that she had been abused by the appellant. The Crown argued at trial that this evidence was significant in rebutting any suggestion that the complainant's version of events was a fantasy or contrived. In other words, the evidence was said to powerfully assist in suggesting that the complainant's mental ""injuries"" occurred as a result of the abuse she had suffered at the hands of the appellant. 

14However, there was a sequence of events which might have suggested a possible alternative basis for the complainant's symptoms. This arose as follows. 

(i)In February 2007 the complainant began her treatment with Melissa Roberts. The patient was immediately diagnosed as being depressed and anxious. 

(ii)In June 2007 the plaintiff told her school teacher that she had been sexually assaulted by a school mate named JM and that this assault had taken place in April/May 2006. 

(iii)Police were immediately notified of the complaint by the school and spoke to the complainant. 

(iv)The complainant was admitted to hospital in June 2007. It was at this time that she began seeing other counsellors in addition to her psychologist. Once again she was diagnosed as being depressed and anxious. 

(v)The complainant did not tell anyone about the allegations involving the appellant until May 2008. 

15The trial judge made a ruling against the appellant purporting to rely on s 293(4)(a) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Section 293 applies to proceedings in respect of prescribed sexual offence. It provides that certain types of evidence are inadmissible unless permitted under subs (4). The ruling made by the trial judge was that trial counsel could not raise the matters I have listed above either in cross examination or otherwise. In particular, counsel was prevented from suggesting before the jury that the complainant's psychological conditions were, either in whole or in part, related to the JM incident rather than to the alleged abuse by the appellant. 

16In the prosecutor's closing address, and the trial judge's summing up, the complainant's stress and anxiety during the relevant time, including her treatment and hospitalisation, were attributed solely to the allegations against the appellant. The defence were, in effect, precluded from testing whether the JM allegations had a role to play in her psychological injury. 

17The Crown on this appeal has fairly and candidly conceded that the resulting situation was seriously unfair to the appellant and his trial counsel. In addition, the Crown has conceded that the trial judge's ruling was incorrect. The particular evidence was plainly admissible under s 293(4)(c), subject to the Court's satisfaction that its probative value outweighed any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. 

18The Crown accepts for the purposes of this appeal that the situation which developed in the trial carried with it a real risk of a miscarriage of justice. The Crown accepted, on this basis, that a new trial should be ordered. 

Remaining grounds of appeal

19The Crown took issue with the remaining grounds of appeal. As to 2(a), it contests that the evidence can be categorised as tendency evidence and suggests that it was appropriately dealt with as context evidence. In relation to the ground arguing that defence counsel had failed to request an unreliability warning, the Crown argues that such a request was made and granted. Finally, in relation to the last ground of appeal, the Crown submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant had suffered a significant forensic disadvantage because of the consequences of delay. 

Should the Court order a new trial or an acquittal?

20Simpson J, after a thorough and careful analysis, has concluded that the reference to ""foster-parent"" in s 73 Crimes Act includes a reference to a de facto living in a familial relationship with a natural parent of a child at the ages specified in s 73. Her Honour has found, after careful consideration, that the term ""foster-parent"", as used in s 73, is capable of including a de facto of a natural parent, at least where the de facto can be shown to have played a role in the upbringing of the child. My opinion is, with respect, to the contrary. I am conscious that Hoeben J has agreed with Simpson J and that consequently the opinion reflected in my reasons is a dissenting one.

21I shall briefly state why, with respect, I have been unable to agree with the views expressed by Simpson J. As I understand it, there are three principal reasons why Simpson J has reached the decision in her draft judgment. First, her Honour is satisfied that there was a clear statement of what was intended to be achieved by the Burke amendment moved on 27 May 2003. Secondly, her Honour thought it ""inconceivable that Parliament would have intended to perpetuate an invidious discrimination"", described by her Honour at paragraph [132] below. Her Honour described this in the following terms:

""That is discrimination against certain young people on the ground of the marital status of their parents. A child of 16 to 18 whose parent is lawfully married to the perpetrator of sexual abuse, even if consensual, or even if, on prosecution, the Crown could not prove absence of consent, has the protection of s 73. A child whose parent lives in a de facto relationship with that person does not.""

22Thirdly, her Honour, applying well known principles of statutory construction, held that the expression ""foster-parent"" was ambiguous in the context of s 73. In that regard, her Honour concluded that the literal or grammatical meaning of the expression ""foster-parent"" would defeat the purpose of the statute, as her Honour understood its intention. Applying a purposive approach, her Honour determined that the expression ""foster-parent"" in s 73 included a reference to a de facto living in a familial relationship with the natural parent of a child.

23Since this is a dissenting opinion, I can briefly state my reasons for failing to be persuaded by these matters. As to the matter of intention, and despite her Honour's extremely careful analysis, I am not persuaded that the intention of Parliament has been revealed in the manner advocated by her Honour, notwithstanding the history of the matter and the statements made by Mr Burke on 27 May 2003. I think it is simply impossible to know what Mr Burke had in mind when he spoke of an ""anomaly with respect to step-parents"". If he did intend to enlarge the narrow pathway created by the decision in Miller, then the amendment, in my mind, was not intended to have the reach ascribed to it by Simpson J. I do not accept that it is ""inconceivable"" that Mr Burke intended to withhold protection from a child, one of whose natural parents cohabited, without lawful marriage, with another person who had assumed the role of (alternative) parent: see Simpson J at [132].

24I simply do not know, with any certainty, what Mr Burke had in mind. The history of the interpretation by Courts of Parliament's intention is littered with examples where speculation (however well-intentioned) must give way to the actual language used. 

25Secondly, the expression ""foster-parent"" to my mind does not easily equate to a reference to a de facto partner living in a relationship with a natural parent of a child. Regretfully, I take the view that to equate the expression ""foster-parent"" to a de facto is to give a ""strained interpretation"" to the term ""foster-parent"". 

26Thirdly, both the Parliamentary draftsperson and Parliament itself were well versed in expressions in legislation which defined a de facto relationship. Without wishing to be exhaustive in this regard, it is simply sufficient to refer to, for example, s 19 of the Adoption of Children Act 1965. Section 19 of that legislation (as it then stood) enabled persons living in a de facto relationship to seek an order for adoption in their favour. Section 19(1A) provided:

""The Court may make an adoption order in favour of a man and a woman who are living together as husband and wife on a bona fide domestic basis although not married to each other ...""

27Another example of the definition of de facto relationships consistent with the definition of ""domestic relationships"" appears in the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW).

28Equally, as Ms Manuell's examples show, the expression ""foster-parent"" has been historically recognised in the Parliament of this State.

29It is clear that, had Parliament wished to amend s 73 to include persons in a de facto relationship, it could have done so by the use of language perfectly suited to that situation. I consider that the Crown was correct in its written submission when it said:

""No one, particularly those who draft legislation, would choose the term 'foster-parents' to deliberately seek to encompass de facto parents.""

30In my opinion, the intention in the 2003 amendment was to cover situations where children were fostered out to homes at which neither of their natural parents resided. That fostering agreement may not need to have been done by any legal act or formal legal agreement, but it must be a situation whereby the victim is being cared for by a person, or persons, none of whom are their natural parents.

31The final matter I should mention is this: Simpson J has recognised in her decision that it is not every de facto who will qualify for inclusion in the term ""foster-parent"". Her Honour observed that it may be necessary to adduce evidence as to the nature of the actual relationship by including matters such as financial and/or emotional support, discipline, participation in family activities and participation in educational, sporting or recreational activities. Such an approach would necessarily involve a trial within a trial and, I would venture to suggest, an extremely complicated trial within a trial at that. 

32For these reasons, I am unable to agree that the term ""foster-parent"" as used in s 73 is intended to include a de facto partner of a natural parent.

33I would hold that ground 1 of the appeal has been made out. I agree, however, with Simpson J, that it is unnecessary to make findings in relation to the remaining grounds of appeal.

34Before departing from the matter, I wish to add this: there is plainly, as Simpson J's careful reasoning shows, a powerful argument to suggest that the expression ""foster-parent"" may have been intended to extend to the de facto situation. Although I have not been persuaded to that view, I recognise that it is unsatisfactory that any uncertainty surrounding the statutory definition should persist. It is clear, in my view, that s 73 requires urgent and immediate attention by the legislature. In my opinion, the legislature as presently framed does not possess a sufficient level of clarity or precision. It may be that Parliament's intention was as Simpson J's decision suggests. On the other hand, it may have been that Parliament deliberately refrained from including de facto relationships within the terms of s 73. The statute under consideration is a penal statute and its application to and consequences for persons accused of a serious offence should be beyond argument. That is not the present situation.

35In those circumstances, it is my view that a copy of this decision should be taken out and forwarded by the Registrar to the Attorney General for his urgent consideration.

36Since my judgment is a dissenting one, I will simply conclude by stating that the orders I would have imposed are:

(1)Appeal against conviction allowed, conviction quashed.

(2)That a verdict of acquittal be entered on counts 5 and 6.

(3)That there be a new trial on the remaining counts in the indictment.

37SIMPSON J: On 10 August 2009 the appellant was arraigned in the District Court at Orange on an indictment that contained six counts alleging sexual offences. He entered a plea of not guilty to each count. On 18 August 2009, after a trial, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all six counts. 

38All counts were brought under the Crimes Act 1900. They were: -

two counts (counts 1 and 2) under s 66C(4);

two counts (counts 3 and 4) under s 66C(2);

two counts (counts 5 and 6) under s 73(1).

Offences against subss 66C(2) and (4) (the offences the subject of Counts 1 - 4) are offences committed in circumstances of aggravation. In each case, the specific circumstance of aggravation alleged was that the complainant was under the authority of the appellant (Crimes Act s66C(5)(d)).

39Section 66C(2) prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Section 66C(4) prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. Section 73(1) prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 8 years. It will be necessary shortly to say more about the nature of the offences created by these provisions, and the evidence upon which the appellant was convicted.

40On 16 November 2009, Hosking DCJ sentenced the appellant as follows:


on each of the s 66C(4) offences: concurrent terms of imprisonment for 4 years, commencing on 18 August 2009 and expiring on 17 August 2013, with non-parole periods of 2 years and 8 months, to expire on 17 April 2012; 
on each of the s 66C(2) offences: terms of imprisonment of 6 years, with non-parole periods of 4 years, to be served concurrently with one another, but accumulated by 1 year upon the earlier imposed sentences, and therefore to commence on 18 August 2010 and expire on 17 August 2016; the non-parole periods to expire on 17 August 2014; 
on each of the s 73(1) offences: imprisonment for 3 years, with non-parole periods of 2 years, also to be served concurrently with one another, but accumulated upon the sentences imposed in respect of the s 66C(2) offences by a further 3 years, and therefore to commence on 18 August 2013 and expire on 17 August 2016; the non-parole periods to expire on 17 August 2015.

41The appellant appeals against the convictions. He has abandoned an application for leave to appeal against the sentences. 

The relevant legislation

42Section 66C(2) is in the following terms:

""Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years in circumstances of aggravation is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.""

Section 66C(4) is in the following terms:

""Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years in circumstances of aggravation is liable to imprisonment for 12 years.""

Sub-section (5) defines ""circumstances of aggravation"" in a variety of ways, of which that presently relevant is para (d): 

""the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender.""

Sub-sections 73(1) to (3) are in the following terms:

""(1.)Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who:
(a) is under his or her special care, and
(b) is of or above the age of 16 years and under the age of 17 years,
is liable to imprisonment for 8 years.""

(2.)Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who:
(a)is under his or her special care, and
(b)is of or above the age of 17 years and under the age of 18 years,
is liable to imprisonment for 4 years.

(3)For the purposes of this section, a person (the victim) is under the special care of another person (the offender) if, and only if: 
(a)the offender is the step-parent, guardian or foster parent of the victim, 
(b)the offender is a schoolteacher and the victim is a pupil of the offender,
(c)the offender has an established personal relationship with the victim in connection with the provision of religious, sporting, musical or other instruction to the victim, or
(d)the offender is a custodial officer of an institution of which the victim is an inmate, or
(e)the offender is a health professional and the victim is a patient of the health professional.""

43It is convenient at this point to refer to the indictment. The indictment upon which the appellant was presented was in the following terms:

Counts 1 and 2:

""Between 1 February 2007 and 25 March 2007 at Orange in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], she then being above the age 14 years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years of age, in circumstances of aggravation, namely she was under the authority of [the appellant] by reason of he then being her stepfather.""

44Counts 3 and 4:

""Between 1 July 2004 and 31 October 2005 at Orange in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], she then being under the age of 16 years, namely between 12 and 14 years of age, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that she was under the authority of [the appellant] by reason of he then being her stepfather.""

45Counts 5 and 6:

""Between 1 March 2008 and 25 March 2008 at Orange in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] who at the time was 16 years of age under the care [sic] of [the appellant] by reason of he then being her stepfather.""

(The allegation ought to have been that the complainant was under the ""special care"" of the appellant.

46During the course of trial, a number of amendments were made to the indictment. The most significant for present purposes was the substitution, in each count, of the term ""foster [parent/father]"" where the term ""step-father"" had appeared. I will explain below the circumstances in which this amendment was made. Amendments were also made to some of the dates specified, and to the age of the complainant, but these are not material to the matters raised on appeal.

The Crown case

47Having regard to the grounds of appeal, and to a concession properly made on behalf of the Crown, the facts of the Crown case can be stated briefly.

48The complainant was born on 29 July 1991. She has a younger brother and a younger sister. In 1999, when she was eight years of age, her mother and the appellant commenced a de facto relationship. A son was born of that relationship later in 1999. The family lived together at various addresses in Orange until March 2008, when the appellant left the family home.

49The complainant alleged that, during the currency of the de facto relationship, the appellant regularly, and in a variety of ways, sexually interfered with her. Her allegations resulted in the six specific charges of sexual intercourse on the indictment. The counts were differentiated into pairs, involving different sections of the Crimes Act, depending upon the age of the complainant at the time the offences were alleged to have been committed. Thus, the offences charged in counts 3 and 4 were alleged (after amendment) to have been committed between July 2001 and December 2002, when the complainant was between 10 and 11 years of age (and under the authority of the appellant); the offences charged in counts 1 and 2 were alleged to have been committed between February and May 2007, when the complainant was 15 years of age (and under the authority of the appellant); and the offences charged in counts 5 and 6 were alleged to have been committed in March 2008, when the complainant was 16 years of age (and under the special care, as defined in s 73(3) of the Crimes Act of the appellant). None of the offences charged involves, or requires, an allegation, or proof, of lack of consent.

50I defer, until consideration of the relevant grounds of appeal, further reference to the factual issues.

The trial

51The jury was empanelled and the trial commenced on 10 August 2009. The complainant's evidence was taken, initially, by way of the tender of DVDs of two interviews of her conducted by a police officer, Detective Senior Constable Megan Fawkner, in the presence of an officer of the Department of Youth and Community Services. The first interview took place on 27 May 2008. The second, which consisted largely of the complainant's reading from notes she had made in the interim, took place on 29 September 2008. The jury were provided with transcripts of the interviews. The complainant gave some additional evidence in chief and was cross-examined over that and the following two days. The import of the cross-examination was that none of the incidents which she described had occurred. The complainant agreed that she had not made any complaint about the appellant's conduct until May 2009, on the evening before the first interview. The circumstances in which the complainant made her complaint to police officers were not revealed with any clarity in the evidence. It does appear that she may have made some disclosures to her mother (and, possibly, a friend) shortly before the first interview.

52On 13 August 2009 the complainant's mother gave evidence, as did two police officers and a psychologist who had assessed and treated the complainant in 2007. There was a significant body of evidence concerning the complainant's mental state at least from February 2007. I will refer to this in more detail when I come to the individual grounds of appeal.

53During the course of the cross-examination of the complainant's mother, an issue was raised by defence counsel concerning allegations previously made by the complainant against a male pupil at a local school, and on which he wished to cross-examine. After brief consideration of s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the cross-examination was rejected. Since that question is the focus of a discrete ground of appeal, I will defer outlining the circumstances, and the evidence sought to be adduced (so far as it is ascertainable), until I come to deal with that ground of appeal.

54The Crown case closed after the evidence of the police officers.

55At that point, the Crown Prosecutor raised (apparently not for the first time) a question concerning amendment to the indictment in respect of some of the dates specified. That was done, over what was said by defence counsel to be ""formal"" objection.

56The appellant gave evidence. He denied all allegations. He called a number of character witnesses. That concluded the evidence in the defence case, although the defence case was not then formally closed. The Crown sought, but was refused, a case in reply.

57Defence counsel then indicated that he wished to ""raise a point of law"". He produced a copy of the decision of this Court in R v Miller [2001] NSWCCA 209; 127 A Crim R 344.

58Miller was a case that concerned s 73 of the Crimes Act. However, it concerned a version of s 73 that predates the current version. At that time, s 73(1) was in the following terms:

""Whosoever, being a schoolmaster or other teacher, or a father, or stepfather, unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of 16 and under the age of 17 years, being his pupil, or daughter, or stepdaughter, shall be liable to imprisonment for 8 years.""

59In Miller, this Court held that a de facto relationship between the parent of a child and another person does not, for the purposes of s 73 as it then stood, give rise to the relationship of step-parent and step-child between the de facto partner and the child. However, after the decision in Miller, s 73 was quite extensively amended to incorporate the notion of ""special care"" as defined in subs (3) thereof. The amendment introduced, in addition to ""step-parent"", the notion of ""foster parent"". It contained no definition of that term. (For the terms of s 73 as amended, and as presently relevant, see above at [42].) 

60After discussion, the trial judge allowed all counts in the indictment to be further amended by the substitution I have referred to above, of the terms ""foster-father"" or ""foster parent"" where ""step-father"" had previously appeared. It is only in relation to Counts 5 and 6 that this is presently material.

The grounds of appeal: 

61The grounds of appeal are pleaded as follows:

""1.The convictions in respect of Counts 5 and 6 (Crimes Act 1900, s 73(1)) cannot be supported by the evidence.

2.In respect of each of the convictions, a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by one or more of the following:

(a)the admission of tendency evidence contrary to Evidence Act 1995, s 907[sic - 97];

(b)defence counsel's failure to rely on Criminal Procedure Act 1986 s 293(4)(c);

(c)defence counsel's failure to request a warning as to the unreliability of the complainant's evidence, under Evidence Act 1995 s 165(1)(c), and trial judge's failure to give such a direction; and/or

(d)defence counsel's failure to request a direction under Evidence Act 1995 s 165B and the trial judge's failure to give such a direction.""

Ground 2(b): Criminal Procedure Act, s 293

62It is convenient to deal first with Ground 2(b). I note here that this ground is, very properly, conceded by the Crown. It is, however, necessary to set out in some detail the circumstances, in order to demonstrate that the Court accepts the concession, and why it does so. 

63Section 293 is relevantly in the following terms:

""293.  Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience

(1)  This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence.

(2)  ...

(3)  Evidence that discloses or implies:

(a)  that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or

(b)  has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity,

is inadmissible.

(4)  Sub-section (3) does not apply:

(a)  if the evidence:

(i) is of the complainant's sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and

(ii)  is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed,

(b)  if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant,

(c)  if:

(i)  the accused person is alleged to have had sexual intercourse (as defined in section 61H(1) of the Crimes Act 1900) with the complainant, and the accused person does not concede the sexual intercourse so alleged, and

(ii)  the evidence is relevant to whether the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease or injury is attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged to have been had by the accused person,

(d)  ...

(e)  ...

(f)  ...

and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission.

(5)  A witness must not be asked:

(a)  to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or

(b)  by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible.

(6)  If the court is satisfied:

(a)  that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period:

(i)  had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or

(ii)  had taken part it, or not taken part in, sexual activity or a general or specified nature, and

(b)  the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication,

the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified.

(7)...

(8)...""

There is no issue that all the offences charged were, for the purposes of s 293(1), ""prescribed sexual offences"": (see Criminal Procedure Act s 3).

64The background to the issue raised by Ground 2 (b) is as follows. The complainant was 16 years of age when she took part in the first interview, 17 at the second and 18 when she gave evidence in the trial. In the first interview, she recounted a number of instances of sexual molestation of her by the appellant, including penile/vaginal intercourse. 

65Her evidence, and the evidence of the psychologist, established that she had a troubled history. At the end of the first interview, she told Detective Fawkner that in about February or March 2007 she began consulting a psychologist called Melissa Theobold (later Roberts). She said that she had not told Ms Theobold of her allegations about the appellant. She said that she had been in hospital in 2007. When Detective Fawkner asked the reason for the hospital admission, she said:
 
""Um, I was sick, I suppose I just had enough, I just 

66In oral evidence, asked about the same hospital admission, she said:

""I had really bad headaches and I was sick and I had cramps in my stomach.""

She said that the penile/vaginal intercourse had occurred before her admission to hospital. When asked if she had complained to the hospital of any other symptoms, she said that she reported:

"" ... that I was hearing voices.""

She was asked why she had told the hospital that she was hearing voices and she answered:

""I don't know I suppose I was looking for something, to ask me something, ask me questions or ... anything, someone to I suppose initiate or just ask me if anything was wrong at home or anything happening or --.""

She said she had not been asked those questions but she had indeed been hearing voices. The voice she heard was that of the appellant who was telling her:

""That if I was to say anything to anyone that no one would listen to me or no one would believe me.""

She said that the appellant had frequently used those words to her.

67The psychologist gave evidence under her married name, Roberts. She said that she had first met the complainant on 10 February 2007, the complainant having been referred to her for assessment and treatment for depression and ""suicide ideation"". She said the complainant presented with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, was experiencing

""... lots of panic attacks and sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance and thoughts of not wanting to be around any more.""

68The complainant also reported to Ms Roberts experiencing auditory hallucinations with a male voice. Ms Roberts said that she had continued to see the complainant. On 13 May 2008 the complainant for the first time told her of her allegations against the appellant. She said that when the complainant spoke of those incidents:

"" ... she appeared highly stressed, her [a]ffect was anxious, she was shaking, she found it difficult to speak.""

and that those manifestations continued both before and after she first made the disclosures. She said that on 4 June 2008 the complainant reported that the appellant had been sexually assaulting her and that the complainant was highly distressed and anxious, her body was visibly shaking and she was crying. When Ms Roberts asked for details of the abuse she became more anxious and appeared to dissociate. She said that the symptoms she observed were consistent with flashbacks of the abuse that she reported.

69The evidence concerning the complainant's mental condition assumed considerable prominence. The Crown Prosecutor addressed on it at some length, unequivocally suggesting that the symptoms described were attributable to the conduct alleged against the appellant.

70Similarly, in the summing up, considerable reference was made to this aspect of the Crown case.

71Plainly, the Crown case was that the complainant's anxiety and depression were a direct result of the conduct she asserted against the appellant. That could be seen as powerful corroboration of her allegations, and therefore an important component of the Crown case.

72Equally plainly, evidence that might suggest an alternative explanation could be seen as an important aspect of the defence case, having significant capacity to dilute the otherwise prejudicial effect of the evidence.

73No attempt was made on behalf of the appellant to introduce such evidence. That such evidence was potentially available is apparent from some exchanges between counsel and the judge in the absence of the jury.

74The subject first arose, although in an oblique way, during the cross-examination of the complainant. The topic under discussion (raised in the absence of the jury) was the extent to which defence counsel would be permitted to cross-examine the complainant about the lateness of her complaints about the appellant's conduct. During that discussion, defence counsel said:

""If the witness is called, could I just say this your Honour, I also wish to put to her that she didn't say anything to the teacher [named] nor to a Detective Senior Constable Geraldine Bunting and it was in June 06 that she spoke to Bunting in relation to the alleged sexual assault by the boy at school. I'm not going to raise it but she certainly was interviewed and I would say in relation to an unrelated matter. She spoke to police on an unrelated matter."" (emphasis added)

75This was evidently the first the trial judge had heard of the suggestion of a sexual assault by somebody other than the appellant. When he asked about it, defence counsel replied:

""Yes, your Honour. Sexual assault in about April or May 2006. The complainant was interviewed by police in June 2006, then withdrew the complaint.""

76A voir dire then began. Its principal subject matter was the timing of the complaint made by the complainant, and the delay by the complainant in raising those matters, despite having had some opportunities to report the allegations to various people (such as Ms Theobold/Roberts). This question was put to the complainant:

""In relation to another matter you were spoken to by police in June 2007 by Detective Senior Constable Geraldine Bunting, do you remember that was about a boy up at Canobolas?"" 

77There followed some questioning of the complainant (still on the voir dire) by the Crown Prosecutor, after which defence counsel further cross-examined. The following evidence is recorded:

""Q. Ma'am you see when you say that Ms Pankhurst [a school teacher] went to the principal, that was in relation to the [JM] matter wasn't it? 
A. Yeah.
Q. Not in relation to [the appellant]?
A. No I hadn't said anything about him.
Q. No, right. So you hadn't told Ms Pankhurst about [the appellant], had you? 
A. No, I hadn't told anybody.
Q. And you never told Ms Pankhurst about [the appellant] did you?
A. No.
Q. You told Ms Pankhurst about [JM] is that right? 
A. Yeah, yeah.
Q. It was what you told Ms Pankhurst about [JM] that caused her to go to the principal is that right? 
A. Yeah."" 

(""JM"" was the schoolboy about whom the complainant had complained in June 2007.)

78There then followed a discussion about how to deal with this evidence. Section 293 was mentioned.

79The following day, again in the absence of the jury, defence counsel said:

""You see, I did say to the witness, to the complainant, she didn't make any complaint to those people prior to May of 08, and in the statement of Ms Roberts, she talks about the first time is 13 May 08. You see the difficulty with this case is that lurking in the wings is the alleged sexual assault by the boy at Canobolas High School and that occurred in about April or May of 2006 and then it wasn't reported until about early 2007, and of course it's after that's reported that this complainant goes to hospital, in May of 2007, and of course that can't be raised. So that is lurking in the wings. We don't know why in May of 2007 the complainant went to hospital."" (emphasis added)

Section 293 was again raised. 

80Later, during cross-examination of the complainant's mother, and again in the absence of the jury, defence counsel said:

""Your Honour whilst the jury are out, I wish to raise this aspect of being able to ask this witness [the complainant's mother] about the fact that in 2006 [the complainant] was the subject of an alleged sexual assault by the boy [JM] and that that was reported to the police in 2007 and that she then withdrew that complaint. And that's why there's a difficulty with this case, because lurking in the background, is this issue."" [AB 341]

81Again, consideration was given to s 293. There appears to have been general agreement that s 293 precluded admission of any evidence concerning the alleged assault by JM. The evidence concerning the complainant's allegations about the conduct of JM is evidence that fits the description above (at [77]) of evidence capable of significantly diluting the effect of the evidence suggesting the complainant's psychological condition was attributable to the misconduct she alleged against the appellant.

82On the appeal, the Crown fairly conceded that a psychological condition such as that suffered by the complainant comes within the term ""disease or injury"" for the purposes of s 293(4)(c)(ii). The suffix to that subsection must, therefore, be considered - the evidence is admissible, provided that its probative value outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission.

83In my opinion, the evidence meets that test. The evidence was potentially of very significant probative value. The Crown did not suggest otherwise.

84The evidence was, therefore, admissible. Notwithstanding the acquiescence of counsel for the appellant in the evidence being withheld, the Crown did not seek to rely on Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. This was a responsible position for the Crown to adopt.

85The consequence is that this ground of appeal must be upheld. The further consequence is that there must be an order for a new trial.

86In order to minimise the distress caused to the complainant, consideration may have to be given to how the evidence is to be elicited. But the potential weight of the evidence (in favour of the appellant) is such that he cannot be deprived of an important possible answer to what became an important part of the Crown case.

87In the circumstances, it is necessary to deal with only one other ground, Ground 1.

Ground 1: Crimes Act s 73

88Ground 1 of the appeal challenges the convictions in respect of Counts 5 and 6. The counts as pleaded in the indictment, after amendment, alleged that the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant, who was then 16 years of age and under the appellant's (special) care by reason that he was her foster parent.

89The basis of the ground is that the appellant could not be shown to have been the complainant's foster parent. The term ""foster parent"", so the appellant's argument ran, does not and cannot extend to a person in a de facto relationship with a natural parent of a complainant. The outcome of the ground depends entirely upon the construction that is placed upon the term ""foster parent"" - as it appears in s 73.

90Initially, the Crown accepted the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant and conceded the ground. A necessary consequence of the concession, if accepted by the Court, is that the convictions on these counts be quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered.

91In explaining, in its written submissions, the basis on which it made the concession, the Crown made a strong case in support of the appellant. After discussion with the Court, however, the Crown withdrew the concession. Nevertheless, it did not advance any argument to the contrary of that put on behalf of the appellant, and the Court was therefore left with no contradictor. In saying that, I mean no criticism of the Crown - it adopted an ethical and fair position, having regard to the advice it received. But that left the Court in the position of conducting its own researches, without the benefit of argument against that put on behalf of the appellant.

92A convenient starting point in consideration of the meaning to be ascribed to the term ""foster parent"" as used in s 73 is the evolution of that section. That was the subject of analysis by Giles JA in Miller, to which I have already referred. Some repetition of what his Honour there said is inevitable. (His Honour's history, of course, stops at 2001, when Miller was decided, at which time s 73 was not in the form it takes today. Just how it came to assume its present form is a matter of considerable importance to which I will return.)

93The feature of s 73 and its forerunners with which I am principally concerned is what is, perhaps colloquially, known as ""the age of consent"". Also of interest are the relationships to which the section is directed. Over the years, s 73 (and its forerunners) have criminalised sexual intercourse between persons in specified relationships, in which one participant is of, or below, a specified age. The provisions have been separate from, and independent of, other provisions criminalising sexual intercourse between a male of any age, and a female under a specified age - (""the carnal knowledge"" provisions"").

94Throughout its history, until 2003, the provisions were directed only to sexual intercourse between a male person in some position of authority, and a female of or under a specified age. No parallel provision existed in relation to males of an equivalent, or any, age.

95The origin of s 73 lies in s 43 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883 (NSW) (""the 1883 Act""). That section relevantly provided:

""43.Whosoever being a schoolmaster or other teacher unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years being his pupil and whosoever being a father carnally knows any girl between such ages being his daughter shall be liable to penal servitude for 14 years. ... And the consent of the pupil or daughter shall be no defence to any charge under this section. Provided that nothing in this clause contained shall prevent such schoolmaster, teacher or parent from being prosecuted under either section 41 or section 42 of this Act.""

96Section 43 has to be seen in the light, particularly, of s 42, which relevantly provided:

""42.Whosoever unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years shall be liable to penal servitude for 10 years. ... And the consent of the girl shall be no defence to any charge under this or the preceding section.""

The preceding section, s 41, created a separate offence, punishable by death, of carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 10.

97That is, as far back as 1883, the NSW Legislature saw fit to draw a distinction between the age of a female at which it became unlawful for a person (read male) to have intercourse with her - and the age of a female at which it became unlawful for a schoolmaster, teacher or father to have intercourse with her. (It seems that there was then no general prohibition on incest.) The general prohibition, contained in s 42, was of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 14. In other words, the age of consent for a female was fixed at 14; but where the prescribed relationship (schoolmaster or teacher and pupil, or father and daughter) was shown to exist, the age prescribed was 16. That suggests that, even in 1883, the Legislature perceived a need to afford protection from sexual predation to young females, and that that protection ought to extend, where a specified relationship of power or authority existed, beyond the age at which protection generally was given.

98It is relevant here to note that there was no equivalent protection afforded to young males. That was because any form of homosexual intercourse was unlawful, initially under the English common law, inherited by NSW on settlement: see Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, 17th ed, 1830, Vol 4. (No recognition appears to have been given to the possibility of heterosexual intercourse between an adult female, or a female in a position of authority, and a young male; or, if such a possibility were contemplated, it was not perceived as calling for criminal penalty.) There was, therefore, no call to prescribe an age of consent for young males. That remained the case until 1984, when the Crimes (Amendment) Act of that year (""the 1984 Act"") was passed by the NSW Parliament. I shall say more of the 1984 Act below.

99In 1900 ""an Act to consolidate the Statutes relating to Criminal Law"" was passed by that Legislature. It became the Crimes Act 1900. By s 71 (in substitution for s 42 of the 1883 Act), the general age of consent for females remained at 14. Sexual intercourse with a female below that age constituted carnal knowledge and was punishable by penal servitude for 10 years. (The death penalty continued to be provided for carnal knowledge of a girl under 10.)

100Section 43 of the 1883 Act was re-enacted as s 73 of the Crimes Act and was then in the following terms:

""Whosoever, being a schoolmaster, or other teacher, or a father, unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 16 years, being his pupil or daughter, shall be liable to penal servitude for 14 years.""

Although the language is different, and more modern, the effect of s 73 was similar to the effect of s 43, and the penalty was unaltered. The prohibited relationships were those of schoolmaster or teacher and pupil, and father and daughter; the age of the female up to which sexual intercourse between those parties was criminalised was 16.

101In 1910 the Crimes (Girls' Protection) Act 1910 was passed, implementing amendments to the Crimes Act. Section 71 of the Crimes Act was amended so that the general age of consent became 16; s 73 was amended so that the prohibited age of sexual intercourse with a female, where the prescribed relationship existed, was 17. The relationship of stepfather and stepdaughter was added to the specified relationships. That amendment also introduced two defences to the charge of carnal knowledge (s 71) that had not previously appeared. These were that the girl in question was over the age of 14: and, either, that she was a common prostitute or an associate of common prostitutes or that the accused had reasonable cause to believe that she was over the age of 16. This amendment also imposed a limitation period of six months for the prosecution of an offence against s 71.

102The rationale for the 1910 amendments to the Crimes Act was stated in the Second Reading Speech by Colonel Onslow, who introduced the Bill, as follows:

""The object of the Bill is to protect girls under the age of 16 years, and, so far as parents and guardians are concerned, girls under the age of 17, against offences which are dealt with under section ... 71 [and] 73 ... of the Crimes Act of 1900; and it is further to extend the protection of that act to stepdaughters, as well as to daughters, in certain cases."" (Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) Legislative Assembly, 2nd Series, 27 July 1909, Vol 33 at 780)

103In 1924, by the Crimes (Amendment) Act of that year, (""the 1924 Act"") the existing s 73 was stated to have been omitted, and a substitute s 73 inserted. However, there is no material (if any) difference between the two versions. The section then read:

""73.Whosoever, being a schoolmaster or other teacher, or a father, or stepfather, unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 17 years, being his pupil, or daughter, or stepdaughter, shall be liable to penal servitude for 14 years.""

104The 1924 Act also introduced, it seems for the first time, an offence of incest; it became an offence for a male to have carnal knowledge of his mother, sister, daughter or granddaughter, and for a female of or above the age of 16 to permit her grandfather, father, brother or son to have carnal knowledge of her.

105The next relevant amendment to s 73 was made in 1985, by the Crimes (Child Assault) Amendment Act 1985. The words ""of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 17 years"" were omitted, and, in substitution, the words ""of the age of 16 years"" inserted. The substitution was relatively short-lived. In 1987, by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1987, s 73 was again amended, to omit the words ""of the age of 16 years"" and reinsert the words ""of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 17 years"". The section then read:

""Whosoever, being a schoolmaster or other teacher or a father, or step-father, unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of 16 years, and under the age of 17 years, being his pupil, or daughter, or stepdaughter, shall be liable to imprisonment for 8 years.""

106That was how the section stood in 2001, when Miller was decided.

107I have mentioned above that homosexual intercourse was absolutely prohibited. I will attempt to deal more briefly with the history of these provisions. (They have a relevance which may not be immediately apparent.) Section 59 of the 1883 Act appeared under the heading ""Unnatural Offences"", with a side note ""Sodomy and Bestiality."" It provided:

""59.Whosoever commits the abominable crime of buggery either with mankind or with any animal shall be liable to penal servitude for life or any term not less than five years.""

Section 60 made like provision for attempts to commit offences against s 59.

108In 1900, s 59 was transferred, in identical terms, into the Crimes Act 1900 as s 79 of that Act.

109In 1955, by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1955, two new sections, ss 81A and 81B, were inserted. They were in the following terms:

""81AWhosoever, being a male person, in public or private, commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of indecency with another male person shall be liable to imprisonment for two years.

81B(1)Whosoever, being a male person, in any public place -

(a)solicits or incites: or

(b)attempts to solicit or incite, 

in any manner whatsoever any male person to commit or to be a party to the commission of any offence under section seventy-nine, eight-one, or 81A of this Act shall be liable to imprisonment for 12 months.

...""

110Except for reduction in penalty (from imprisonment for life or a minimum of five years provided by the 1883 Act, to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years, provided by the 1924 Act), s79 remained in the form set above until 1984. By the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1984 the heading ""Unnatural Offences"" was omitted, as was the reference to ""the abominable crime of buggery"". The section continued to provide for an offence of bestiality. The effect of this amendment was to decriminalise homosexuality, with the exception effected by a new s 78K.

111The new s 78K provided:

""78KA male person who has homosexual intercourse with a male person of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 18 years, shall be liable to penal servitude for 10 years.""

112This was, in a sense, the male (or homosexual) equivalent of s 71, in that it enacted an age of consent. One marked difference will be observed: while the age of consent for females was 16, that is the age of consent for female heterosexual intercourse was 16, the age of consent for male homosexual intercourse was 18 years.

113A male parallel of s 73 was also enacted, in s 78N, in the following terms:

""A male person, who, being a schoolmaster or other teacher, or father, or stepfather, has homosexual intercourse with any male person of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 18 years, being his pupil, son or stepson, shall be liable to penal servitude for 14 years.""

The effect of this was to make homosexual intercourse, where the prescribed relationship existed, and the pupil, son or stepson was under the age of 18, more serious than homosexual intercourse with a person under the age of 18, which continued to be a criminal offence (s 78K).

114That was the statutory history as at 2001, when Miller was decided. The appellant in that case (to whom, to avoid confusion, I will refer by name) was charged under s 73 as a stepfather. He entered a plea of guilty to that count. The Crown accepted the plea in full satisfaction of the indictment (which had contained also a count of sexual intercourse without consent). Like the present appellant, Miller had cohabited with the complainant's mother, but was not married to her. The Crown sought and was granted leave to withdraw its acceptance of the plea of guilty, on the basis that, in those circumstances, Miller could not be shown to have been the complainant's stepfather. At first instance it was held that a stepfather could only be ""a person linked by marriage to the victim's mother"" withdraw acceptance of the plea was accordingly granted to the Crown. Miller was granted leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, but the appeal was dismissed, this Court upholding that conclusion. In the course of his judgment, Giles JA considered the purpose of the then s 73. His Honour said:

""51.Let it be accepted that the purpose of s 73 of the Act was and is to protect young girls from abuse by persons who are positions of authority and control over them. Nonetheless the legislature has chosen to fulfil the purpose by stating particular relationships which will normally bring authority and control - teacher and pupil, father and daughter, stepfather and stepdaughter. It has not used the criterion of authority and control. ..."" (italics added)

115Giles JA went on to consider the ""ordinary"" meaning of the terms ""step-father"" and ""step-daughter"". After considering dictionary definitions, and relevant decided cases, he concluded that:

""42.Marriage between the step-parent and the parent of the child is the basis of the step-relationship ...""

and that Miller was not a ""stepfather"" within the meaning of s 73.

116The present argument is that reasoning of the same kind that led the Court, in that case, to its conclusion in respect of the meaning of ""stepfather"", must lead the Court as presently constituted to the same conclusion in respect of the meaning of ""foster parent"". That is that on consideration of the ""ordinary"" meaning of the term (no relevant decided case was cited) this Court should conclude that the appellant is not a ""foster-parent"" within the meaning of s 73.

117It is of some note that neither ""step-father"" (or ""step-parent"") nor ""foster parent"" has ever been defined in the Crimes Act.

118It is now necessary to take the history forward, and to explore how s 73 came to be in its present form. It is because the explanation is entwined with the course of amendments to the law relating to homosexual acts, that I have set out above the history of those provisions. 

119In 2003, the then Attorney-General, Mr Debus, introduced into the Legislative Assembly the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Bill 2003 (""The Bill""). The long title of the Bill was:

""An Act to amend the Crimes Act 1900 to provide for the equal treatment of sexual offences against males and females and to increase the penalties for sexual offences against children; and for other purposes""

120The amended version of s 73 that was proposed in the Bill was in the following terms:

""73.Sexual intercourse by teacher
(1)Any teacher who has sexual intercourse with a pupil of the teacher who is of or above the age of 16 years and under the age of 17 years is liable to imprisonment for 8 years.

(2)Any person who attempts to commit an offence under sub-section (1) is liable to the penalty provided for the commission of the offence.

(3)A teacher does not commit an offence under this section if the teacher and the pupil to whom the charge relates were, at the time of the offences alleged to have been committed, married to each other.""

This proposed provision retained the age of consent (within the specified relationships) as 17; and it removed the relationship of father and daughter, and stepfather and stepdaughter. That was because it was proposed to deal with those relationships separately, as incest: see cl 15 of the Bill, proposing a new s 78A. Moreover, it applied equally to males and females, whether as teacher or pupil. That reflected the overriding purpose of the Bill.

121The Parliamentary Debates with respect to the Bill make interesting reading. However, it seems that the amendment to s 73 proposed was almost incidental. An Explanatory Note that accompanied the Bill contained the following:

""Overview of Bill

The object of this Bill is to amend and repeal some provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 ... to provide for the equal treatment of sexual offences irrespective of whether the victim or the perpetrator is male or female. In particular, the Bill repeals certain provisions that apply solely to a male homosexual act. The result will be that, in the future, certain types of sexual offences by any person, whether male or female, against any other person, whether male or female, will be dealt with on the same bases including as to the age of the victim, the defences available to the accused and the penalties for the offence. The age of consent for all persons will be 16 years.""

122The purpose of the Bill was, as explained in the Second Reading Speech delivered by Mr Debus:

""... to provide for the equal treatment of sexual offences irrespective of whether the victim or the perpetrator is male or female. The Crimes Act is presently discriminatory in that it provides different penalties for sexual offences depending on whether the perpetrator and victim are male or female. The Act is also discriminatory in that it provides different ages of consent for heterosexual and homosexual intercourse. The bill removes this discrimination and ensures equal treatment before the law. The bill rationalises the age of consent in New South Wales to 16 years of age for all persons irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. ..."" (Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) NSW Legislative Assembly, 7 May 2003, p 374) (italics added)

123Put simply, the purpose of the Bill, and its principal focus, was to equalise the age of consent with respect to males and females by removing the prohibition on homosexual intercourse between males between the age of 16 and 18. That was a highly controversial proposal and gave rise to extensive debate in both Houses of the NSW Parliament. In those circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the proposal to amend s 73 attracted little attention. The Explanatory Note contained little with respect to the proposed s 73, being limited to this:

""Schedule 1[12] recasts sections 73-75 of the Principal Act (which make it an offence for a male teacher or parent to have carnal knowledge of a female pupil or child under 17 years of age). The revised offence will apply to both males and females. The proposed offence will not apply if the persons concerned are married to each other. References to parents are omitted and dealt with in the revised incest offence - see Schedule 1[15].""

124What was contained in the Explanatory Note was echoed by the Attorney-General in the Second Reading Speech. With respect to s 73, he said:

""The [B]ill also removes the offence of carnal knowledge by a male teacher, parent or stepparent under s 73 of the Act. The provision is replaced with the offence of sexual intercourse by a teacher. The revised offence will apply to both male and female perpetrators and complainants. References to parent and stepparent have been removed as they are adequately dealt with in the revised incest provision. The revised incest provision applies to any person who has sexual intercourse with a close family member of or above the age of 16 years. The Act presently only criminalises behaviour defined as carnal knowledge, within the family, committed by a male against a female or allowed by a female to be committed against her by a male.""

125In other words, the purpose - and, it seems, the principal purpose - of the then proposed amendment to s 73 was also to equalise the law so that it applied in the same way to both males and females. The section, if amended as proposed, would have been limited to sexual intercourse between a teacher (of either gender) and a pupil (of either gender) who was over 16 years and under 17 years. The reference to ""father"" and ""step-father"" in the pre-2003 s 73 were, as the Attorney-General explained, to be removed because offences of that kind were dealt with in provisions concerning incest, in what became s 78A. Those proposals also removed differentiation based on gender in respect of incest offences.

126How, then, did s 73 come to be in its present form (which, as I have shown, is not the form in which it was presented to Parliament in the Bill)? The answer to that question is to be found in the speech in the Legislative Council of the Honourable Tony Burke. On 22 May 2003 Mr Burke said:

"" ... immediately after I conclude my speech I will circulate an amendment. One concern that was continually raised was the issue of predatory behaviour, which I have already referred to. One argument that arose immediately ... is that predatory behaviour against 16 year olds and 17 year olds does not apply only in homosexual relationships; it applies also in heterosexual relationships. I do not consider that to be an argument for saying that we do not need to do anything. I see it as an argument for asking, 'where is this bill deficient in the context of predatory behaviour?'

I read the Attorney-General's second reading speech in the other House. In that speech the Attorney-General referred to the fact that it would be an aggravated offence for people under the age of 16 if the older person had authority over the younger person. Immediately I thought that if the phrase 'under the authority of' is used in the second reading speech it would be easy to craft an amendment that would adopt the same principle and to apply it to the legislation. ... My amendment deals with the current provision relating to persons in positions of authority, which refers only to teachers. ...

Clearly, teachers are not the only persons in positions of authority. ... My amendment will not touch the teacher provision - although I am happy to consider forms of words to remodel that provision - but will expand the definition of predatory conduct against a 16 year old or 17 year old to any person who is in authority over that teenager. ... ""(Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), Legislative Council, 22 May 2003, p 1005)

127The reference in the second extracted paragraph above was a reference to what Mr Debus had said in the Second Reading Speech about cl 9 of the Bill, proposing substantial amendment to s 66C of the Crimes Act, which then created an offence of sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 16 years (the descendent of s 71), and an aggravated form of the offence where the person was, either generally or at the time of the sexual intercourse only, under the authority of the person accused. The Bill proposed one offence of sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 14, and another of sexual intercourse with a person between 14 and 16. In each case, an aggravated form of the offence was to be created; circumstances of aggravation included that the alleged victim was, either generally or at the time of the commission of the offence, under the authority of the alleged offender. The outer age limit was to remain at 16.

128Mr Burke also referred to and quoted from the Final Report of the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service (""the Royal Commission""), Vol V: The Paedophile Inquiry, August 1997. At 14.43, the Royal Commissioner invited consideration of:

""creating an offence in relation to an extended group of persons standing in special relationships (cf ss 73 and 78A [of the Crimes Act]) as specified in paragraph 14.40 for which the relevant age would increase (17 years under s 73) to 18 years (as is currently the case with s 78N), to which the defence of consent but honest and reasonable mistake would not apply ...""

129At 14.40, in the context of considering a defence of ""mistaken but reasonable belief as to consent"" the Commissioner referred to ""persons standing in a 'position of trust'."" He reported:

""It would define such persons to include parents, step-parents, foster parents, guardians, custodians, school teachers, religious advisers, health professionals, or any other person providing instruction or services to, or having the care or supervision of or authority over the child, and not being married to that child ...""

130Much of this found its way into the speech subsequently made by Mr Burke when, on 27 May 2003, he formally moved the amendment that he had foreshadowed five days earlier. The amendment he proposed was identical with s 73 as it was ultimately enacted. Having proposed the amendment, he said:

""The amendment does a number of things. First, it corrects the anomaly with respect to stepparents. Second, it extends the existing provision that relates specifically to teachers and students who are 16 years of age to a penalty of 8 years and 4 years for 17 year old students. Third, the amendment introduces a number of relationships other than teacher [sic] where there is a similar power relationship and power imbalance. These relationships include those between custodial officers and inmates, people providing religious, sporting, musical or other instruction and their pupils, and the relationship between a health professional and a patient. An offence with respect to a parent is not in the amendment because parents are covered in the provisions relating to incest. ...""(Parliamentary Debate (Hansard), Legislative Council, 27 May 2003, p 1145.) (italics added)

131The Minister who represented the Attorney-General in the Legislative Council, the Hon Carmel Tebbutt, accepted the amendment. That then became the proposal, and it was enacted as the current s 73.

132Just what was the ""anomaly with respect to stepparents"" to which Mr Burke referred cannot be ascertained with certainty from the Debates. It may be that reference to Miller was contained in some briefing papers that were circulated, but which have not been yielded up by my research. It is a reasonable, though perhaps not certain, inference that the ""anomaly"" to which Mr Burke referred was that exposed by Miller. Whether or not that was the anomaly which Mr Burke had in mind, it is and remains an anomaly. While seeking by the introduction of the Bill to remove one invidious anomaly (discriminating, in, specifically, the age of consent on the ground of gender), Parliament has, if the appellant's argument is correct, and whether intentionally or otherwise, perpetuated an equally invidious discrimination. That is discrimination against certain young people on the ground of the marital status of their parents. A child of 16 to 18 whose parent is lawfully married to the perpetrator of sexual abuse, even if consensual, or even if, on prosecution, the Crown could not prove absence of consent, has the protection of s 73. A child whose parent lives in a de facto relationship with that person does not.

133Miller has stated the law in this respect since 2001. (It was never suggested in this Court or in the District Court, that Miller was other than correctly decided). A simple amendment, defining ""stepparent"" to include a de facto partner of a parent would have cured the anomaly. That was not done. Even when the relevant sections of the Crimes Act were under active review in 2003, the opportunity was not taken to make the correction. In this respect the Parliament has been let down badly by its criminal law advisers.

134In the circumstances outlined above, it seems to me to be an inevitable conclusion that Mr Burke, in proposing the amendment, intended to achieve three purposes. One was to extend the protection (previously afforded by s 73 only to females, and then only up to the age of 17) to male and female children up to the age of 18; this he sought to do by subs (2). A second purpose was to extend the reach of s 73 to a wider range of persons in authority over children up to that age; this he sought to do by introducing the notion of ""special care"", as defined in subs (3), and adopting the report of the Royal Commission. A third purpose, in my opinion, was to overcome the ""anomaly"" exposed by Miller; concerning parents in de facto relationships; this he sought to do by the introduction of the word ""foster parent"" into the categories of ""special care relationships"". Moreover, I would infer that Parliament, in accepting Mr Burke's amendment, and passing s 73 in the form proposed by him, adopted his purposes. 

135Mr Burke's references to ""the anomaly concerning stepchildren"" is evidence from which it may be inferred that he was aware of the decision in Miller. It is inconceivable that he intended that the protection of s 73 would be extended to the child of a parent who was lawfully married to a person not the child's natural parent, but withhold it from the child, one of whose natural parents cohabited, without lawful marriage, with another person who assumed the role of (alternative) parent.

136It is of interest that the Report of the Royal Commission (1997) predates the decision in Miller. That, in my opinion, explains why no proposal was made by the Royal Commission to include in its catalogue of persons in a ""position of trust"" de facto spouses of parents of children. The anomaly later exposed in Miller had not then been discovered.

137Plainly, the first two purposes of Mr Burke were achieved. The question for present determination is whether the language used achieves the third purpose. That calls for consideration of some principles of statutory construction. In what follows I have drawn heavily upon the discussion in Chapter 2 (especially paras 2.19 - 2.36) of D C Pearce & R S Geddes: Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 6th ed (2006) As is there set out, two approaches to statutory interpretation have emerged: the literal approach, and the purposive approach. The literal approach depends upon reliance on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used in the statute under consideration. (I have relied upon the 6th edition in preference to the current 7th edition because the latter contains a less expansive analysis, while not abandoning that contained in the former.)

138Recourse may first be had to dictionary definitions. These are both plentiful, and surprisingly varied. The following definitions appear in the various identified dictionaries: 


The Macquarie Dictionary (Federation Edition) 2001: 

""foster care ... the upbringing or the supervision of the upbringing of foster children, in a private home or a public institution.

foster child ... a child brought up by someone not its own mother or father.

foster brother ... a boy brought up with another child of different parents.

foster sister ... a girl brought up with another child of different parents.

foster child ... a child brought up by someone not its own mother or father.

foster daughter ... a girl brought up like one's own daughter, though not such by birth.

foster father ... one who takes the place of a father in raising a child.

foster mother ... a woman who takes the place of the mother in bringing up a child.

foster parent ... a foster faster or foster mother."" (the italics are mine)

In the 2005 edition, the definition of ""foster child"" became:

""a child brought up by someone who is not their natural or adoptive mother or father.""

The other definitions remained as in 2001.


The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary, 1993:

""foster ... having a specified familial relationship not by blood or adoption, but by virtue of nursing, bringing up, or care, as foster brother, foster daughter, foster sister, foster son. OE.2 concerned with the care of orphans, or children in need of a temporary but stable home.""


The Shorter Oxford Dictionary:

""foster ... having a specified familial relationship not by blood or adoption, but by virtue of nursing, bringing up, or care, as foster brother, foster daughter, foster sister, foster son;

foster child ... a child nursed or brought up as their own by people other than his or her biological or adoptive parents;

foster father ... a man who brings up a child as his own ... foster mother ... (a) woman who nurses and brings up a child as her own, or on behalf of the child's natural mother.""


Collins Dictionary, 1979:

""foster child ... a child looked after temporarily or brought up by people other than its natural or adopted parents.""

There is in this dictionary no definition of ""foster parent"", ""foster father"", or ""foster mother"".

Additional definitions appear in the 2003 version, as follows:

""foster child ... a child looked after temporarily or brought up by people other than its natural or adoptive parents;

foster father ... a man who looks after or brings up a child or children as a father, in place of the natural or adoptive father;

foster mother ... a woman who looks after or brings up a child or children as a mother, in place of the natural or adoptive mother."" (the italics are mine)

A 1986 Australian edition of the Collins Concise Dictionary of the English Language contains (rather curiously) the following definition of ""foster"" (as a transitive verb):

""5. (in combination) of or involved in the rearing of a child by persons other than his natural parents.""

139In both the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, 8th ed, and the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary, 4th ed, a number of definitions of ""foster"" are given. Both include:

""v,tr 3a bring up (a child that is not one's own by birth); (my italics)

...

adj: 1 having a family connection by fostering and not by birth (foster brother; foster child; foster parent).""

I have italicised those definitions most pertinent to the present question.

These two dictionaries diverge when dealing with fostering under the auspices of government agencies, but not otherwise.

140Counsel for the appellant also drew upon definitions contained in various legal dictionaries (Butterworth's Australia Legal Dictionaries; Australian Legal Words and Phrases; Halsbury's Laws of England). Reference was also made to definitions contained in other statutes, such as the Adoption Act (NSW) 2000, and the Children and Young Person's (Care and Protection) Act 1998. I have not found these helpful. That is because all of the definitions contained in the dictionaries define words such as ""foster parent"" and ""foster home"" by reference to the statutory context from which the definitions are drawn. The words are defined for the purposes of the statutes in which they appear. They do not, in my opinion, translate into general currency. That is so also of the references to the terms used in the Adoption Act and the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act. Frequently, the terms are defined for the purpose of authorising, or regulating state-sanctioned foster care of children in need. In those circumstances, a word in common parlance is given a specific statutory meaning but for the limited purpose of the statute in which it is used. It would be quite wrong to graft the specific statutory meaning on to the word as used in common parlance.

141The Crown's concession as to the inapplicability of the term ""foster parent"" to the appellant was based, at least in part, upon the Collins Concise Dictionary definition of ""foster"" (as a verb) (see para *[102] above. The submission was put as follows:

""29.The Collins Concise Dictionary definition for foster parents stated '(In combination) of or involved in the rearing of a child by persons other than his natural parents'.

30.This definition of a 'foster parent' in the Collins Concise Dictionary accords with the current understanding of the term. The important part of the definition though was missed by His Honour [the trial judge] - that being that the rearing of a child by persons OTHER than his natural parents. The victim here was being reared by her NATURAL MOTHER, and male partner. This was not a foster parent situation at all."" (emphasis in the Crown's submissions.)

142I do not accept this as correct. Despite the wide diversity of domestic arrangements in which family units now live, it is still common for children to live with and be brought up by two adults, either or both of whom may be a natural (or adoptive) parent. That one of the caregivers is a natural parent does not, in my opinion, preclude the other taking on the role of a foster parent. This most readily emerges from the definitions of ""foster father"" and ""foster mother"" in the 2003 Collins Dictionary, and, possibly least readily, from the definition of ""foster child"" in the 1979 version (""a child looked after temporarily or brought up by people other than its natural or adopted parents"").

143The definition of ""foster child"" in the 2001 Macquarie Dictionary is open to two interpretations. Where a child is brought up by two caregivers, the definition may mean a child brought up by caregivers neither of whom is ""its own (biological or adoptive) mother or father""; alternatively, it may mean a child brought up by caregivers one of whom is not its own mother or father. The latter fits more neatly with the definitions in that dictionary of ""foster father"" and ""foster mother"", both of which envisage a person taking the place of the mother or the father in bringing up a children, but neither of which excludes the involvement of a natural parent of the other gender.

144I appreciate that a de facto partner of a parent of a child does not immediately spring to mind as an example of a foster parent. Nor, however, does such a person obviously or necessarily fall outside that description.

145Even under a strict literal approach to the construction of s 73, it is, in my opinion, possible to construe the term ""foster parent"" so as to include a de facto spouse cohabiting with (and participating in the rearing of the children of) the natural parent of a child. But in case the literal approach to the interpretation of the term is thought to yield an equivocal result, recourse may be had to the purposive approach - which is, in any event (in my opinion) the more contemporary and favoured method of dealing with obscure questions of statutory construction. That is, not least, because s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 so dictates. It is, according to McHugh JA (as he then was):

"" ... the method of statutory construction which now prevails"": Kingston v Keprose Pty Ltd (1987) 11 NSWLR 404

146In Project Blue Sky Inc. & Ors v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said:

""78.However, the duty of a court is to give the words of a statutory provision a meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision. But not always. The context of the words, the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction ... may require the words of a legislative provision to read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or grammatical meaning. ...""

147Their Honours quoted, at some length, from Bennion: Statutory Interpretation, 3rd ed (1997), Butterworths. There, the learned author wrote:

""The distinction between literal and legal meaning lies at the heart of the problem of statutory interpretation. An enactment consists of a verbal formula. Unless defectively worded, this has a grammatical meaning in itself. ... Unhappily [the] state of being able to rely on grammatical meaning does not prevail in the realm of statute law; nor is it likely to. In some cases the grammatical meaning, when applied to the facts of the instant case, is ambiguous. Furthermore there needs to be brought to grammatical meaning of an enactment due consideration of the relevant matters drawn from the context (using that term in its widest sense). Consideration of the enactment in its context may raise factors that pull in different ways. For example, the desirability of applying the clear literal meaning may conflict with the fact that this does not remedy the mischief that Parliament intended to deal with.""

148The last sentence has, here, direct applicability. Even if (contrary to my stated view) the clear literal meaning of ""foster parent"" excluded a person in the position of the appellant, the result would be that the statute failed to remedy the mischief with which Parliament intended to deal.

149Section 34 of the Interpretation Act permits the use of extrinsic material, in stated circumstances, in the interpretation of statutes. It relevantly provides:

""34(1).In the interpretation of a provision of an Act ... if any material not forming part of the Act ... is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to that material:

(a)to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision ... or

(b)to determine the meaning of the provision:

(i) if the provision is ambiguous or obscure, or

(ii)if the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act ... and the purpose or object underlying the Act ... ) leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.

(2)Without limiting the effect of sub-section (1), the material that may be considered in the interpretation of a provision of an Act, ... includes:

(a)all matters not forming part of the Act that are set out in the document containing the text of the Act as printed by the Government Printer,

(b)any relevant report of a Royal Commission ... that was laid before either House of Parliament before the provision was enacted or made.

(c)...

(d)...

(e)any explanatory note or memorandum relating to the Bill for the Act, or any other relevant document, that was laid before, or furnished to the members of, either House of Parliament by a Minister or other member of Parliament introducing the Bill before the provision was enacted or made,

(f)a speech made to a House of Parliament by a Minister or other member of parliament on the occasion of the moving by that Minister or member of a motion that the Bill for the Act be read a second time in that House, 

(g)...

(h)any relevant material in the minutes of proceedings or the votes and proceedings of either House of Parliament or in any official record of debates in Parliament or either House of Parliament.

(3)In determining whether consideration should be given to any material, or in considering the weight to be given to any material, regard shall be had, in addition to any other relevant matters, to:

(a)the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision ... and

(b)the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without compensating advantage.""

150For the purposes of sub-paras (1)(a) and (1) (b)(ii), having regard to the diversity and lack of uniformity in the dictionary definitions I have set out above, I find it difficult to discern any ""ordinary meaning"" of the term ""foster parent"". However, for that very reason, I am satisfied that, for the purposes of sub-para (1)(b)(i), the meaning of that term is ""ambiguous or obscure"", and therefore the meaning of s 73 is ambiguous or obscure. For that reason it is permissible to have regard to extrinsic materials of the kind referred to in s 34(2). The most helpful of these is the speech made by Mr Burke in explaining the amendment that he proposed. This was, for the purposes of subs (2)(f) a speech made following the Attorney-General's Second Reading Speech.

151Although it may not come squarely within subs (2)(b) I am also of the view that the Report of the Royal Commission is relevant and admissible in order to explain Mr Burke's speech. (My doubt is based upon the circumstance that the Report was laid before Parliament in 1997. That is somewhat remote to 2003. Subsection (2)(b), in my opinion, is more likely directed to reports of the kind mentioned that were connected with the introduction of the legislation under consideration.)

152The ""modern approach"" to statutory construction was subjected to searching analysis by McHugh JA in Kingston (McHugh JA dissented as to the application of the principles, but there has been no suggestion that his statements of principle were other than correct.) His Honour identified as a ""difficulty"" the determination:

"" ... whether Parliament intended a particular set of facts to fall within the factual outline of the proposition [contained in the statutory provision under consideration];""

and the determination of:

""...the ambit of the factual outline which Parliament intended to enact"".

153His Honour said:

""Where the text of the legislative provision which embodies the proposition is grammatically capable of only one meaning and neither the context, the purpose of the provision nor the general purpose of the Act throws any real doubt on that meaning, the grammatical meaning must be taken as representing Parliament's intention as to the meaning of the law. A court cannot depart from the grammatical meaning of a provision because that meaning produces anomalies or injustices where no real doubt as to the intention of Parliament arises: ... If the grammatical meaning does give rise to an injustice or anomaly, however, a real doubt will usually arise as to whether Parliament intended the grammatical meaning to prevail: ... A resulting anomaly or injustice is not itself, however, a ground for departing from the grammatical meaning. Equally the natural and ordinary grammatical meaning of the provision is not decisive ....

Ascertaining the ordinary grammatical meaning of a legislative provision is only the first step in the process of statutory construction. If the consequences of the literal or grammatical construction raise a real doubt as to Parliament's intent, the court is justified in refusing to give the words their literal or grammatical construction ..."" (pp 421, internal references omitted)

154McHugh JA cited Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd v Caxton Publishing Co Ltd [1938] Ch 174 at 201 where the following appeared:

""...[when] the purpose of an enactment is clear, it is often legitimate, because it is necessary, to put a strained interpretation upon some words which have been inadvertently used."" (italics added by McHugh JA).

155His Honour went on to say:

""However, it is not only when words have been inadvertently used that a court is empowered to give a legislative provision a strained construction. A strained construction may be justified because words have been omitted ... or because by inadvertence Parliament has failed to deal with an eventuality required to be dealt with if the purpose of the Act is to be achieved ...: or because the statute proceeds on a mistaken assumption ... or because the purpose of the provision indicates that Parliament did not intend the grammatical meaning to apply ... or because words must be omitted to avoid absurdity. As many of the cases show, the purpose of the legislation may require a meaning to be placed on the words of a particular provision which, standing alone, they cannot reasonably bear. ..."" (p 422)

156He then referred to Jones v Wrotham Park Settled Estate [1980] AC 74, where it was said that if the application of the literal or grammatical meaning would lead to results which would defeat the purpose of the statute the court may read words into the legislation. He identified three conditions which must be met before the court may take that course. These are:

(i)the court must know the mischief with which the Act was dealing;

(ii)the court must be satisfied that by inadvertence Parliament has overlooked an eventuality which must be dealt with if the purpose of the Act is to be achieved:

(iii)the court must be able to state with certainty what words Parliament would have used to overcome the omission if its attention had been drawn to the defect.

157Under the heading ""The purposive approach"", McHugh JA said:

""Purposive construction often requires a sophisticated analysis to determine the legislative purpose and a discriminating judgment as to where the boundary of construction ends and legislation begins. But it is the technique best calculated to give effect to the legislative intention and to deal with the detailed and diverse factual patterns which the legislature cannot always foresee but must have intended to deal with if the purpose of the legislation was to be achieved. 

If the objects and purposes of a statute and the means of their achievements are not declared, they can only be determined by examining the statute as a whole. The ordinary meanings of the individual words together with any statutory definitions will invariably indicate what those objects, purposes and means are. The cumulative weight of their core meanings will indicate the general purpose or purposes of the statute. ... when the statute has been read as a whole and its purpose determined, the prima facie meaning of a provision must, if necessary, give way to the construction which gives effect to the statutory object or purpose. ... the general objects and purposes of the statute will give colour to the individual words, phrases and provisions sometimes modifying their ordinary meanings. 

Once the object or purpose of the legislation is delineated, the duty of the Court is to give effect to it in so far as, by addition or omission or clarification, the relevant provision is capable of achieving that purpose or object. Where the court can see the purpose of a provision from an examination of its terms, little difficulty should be met in giving effect to that purpose. ..."" (p 424)

158Those principles were applied by the Court of Appeal in Tokyo Mart Pty Limited v Campbell (1987) 15 NSWLR 275 and endorsed (by reference) by McHugh JA in Bermingham v Corrective Services Commission of NSW (1988) 15 NSWLR 292. 

159Here, the court is in the advantageous position of having a very clear - I would say unmistakeable - statement of what was intended to be achieved by Mr Burke's amendment. It does not have to delve into the far reaches of the Bill, or the Crimes Act, or even s 73, in order to ascertain what was intended.

160In my opinion, the principles stated by McHugh JA provide ample scope for this Court to accept that the reference to ""foster parent"" in s 73 includes a reference to a de facto living in a familial relationship with a natural parent of a child of the ages specified in s 73. Although I do not believe that including a de facto partner of a parent gives a ""strained interpretation"" to the term ""foster parent"", for any who take a different view, this is a quintessential case in which such a construction would be justified. The intention of Mr Burke, and the Parliament, was, in my opinion, as I have said above, unmistakeable. It was by mere inadvertence, the result of ignorance of the need for definition, that no definition to include such persons, was omitted. The three conditions listed in Jones, and adopted in Kingston, are met. The mischief with which the Act (in this case, Mr Burke's amendment) was dealing is known; by inadvertence, Parliament overlooked an eventuality that must be dealt with if the purpose of Parliament is to be (fully) achieved; and inadvertence can be rectified by reading the term ""foster parent"" as including a de facto partner of a parent of a child, at least where the de facto undertakes a role in the upbringing of the child.

161I have not, of course, overlooked the circumstance that the statute under consideration is a penal statute, and that rules of interpretation are applied more strictly. In Miller, Giles JA said:

""54.It must be remembered that s 73 of the Act provides for a criminal offence. While the rule that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed (see, for example, Buck & Sons v Priester (1987) 19 QBD 629 at 638) is perhaps not applied with the rigour of earlier days, it remains that ambiguity or doubt should be resolved in favour of the subject ...""

162His Honour cited an early case (Dickenson v Fletcher (1873) LR 9 CP affirmed by the High Court in Murphy v Farmer [1988] HCA 31; 165 CLR 19):

""... those who contend that [a] penalty must be inflicted, must shew that the words of the Act distinctly enact that it shall be incurred under the present circumstances.""

163Messrs Pearce and Geddes described this approach as ""somewhat naïve"". They cited Scott v Causey [1907] HCA 80; 5 CLR 132 as a modification of that approach, and Beckwith v The Queen [1976] HCA 55; 135 CLR 569 as endorsing the purposive approach even with respect to criminal statutes. I need not lengthen this judgment by examining the authorities in which this approach has been taken. I bear in mind that, in Krakouer v The Queen [1998] HCA 43; 194 CLR 202, McHugh J said that a court should not ignore the clear (I emphasise ""clear"") words of the provision so as to give it a meaning that would or might make it easier to convict an accused if the intention of the legislature is at best a matter of contestable opinion.

164I do not think here that the intention of the legislature is a matter of contestable opinion.

165It will be observed that, above, I have added the words ""familial relationship"", and ""at least where the de facto undertakes a role in the upbringing of the child"". It may be that it is not every de facto who will qualify for inclusion in the term ""foster parent""; whether he or she does come within that term will be a question of fact. It may be necessary to adduce evidence as to the nature of the actual relationship by including matters such as financial and/or emotional support, discipline, participation in family activities, and participation in educational or sporting or recreational activities. These are the sorts of things involved in bringing up a child or in ""tak[ing] the place of a father or mother in raising a child"".

166I am amply satisfied that the term ""foster parent"", as used in s 73 is capable of including a de facto of a natural parent where the de facto can be shown to play a role in the upbringing of the child.

167Accordingly, I would reject Ground 1 of the appeal.

168Since, as I have already held, there must be a new trial as a result of the success of Ground 2, it is unnecessary to deal with the remaining grounds of appeal. Grounds 2(c) and (d) principally complain of failures of trial counsel to seek directions under the Evidence Act 1995. Ground 2(a) complains of the admission of ""tendency evidence"" (see Evidence Act, s 97) in circumstances in which, it seems, no notice of intention to rely on such evidence was given; that was because the Crown did not seek to rely on the evidence in question as ""tendency evidence"". Should the Crown seek to rely on tendency evidence at a new trial, it will be a matter for determination by the trial judge whether or not it is to be admitted.

169The orders I propose are:

1.Appeal against conviction allowed, convictions quashed;

2.There be a new trial on all counts in the indictment.

170HOEBEN J:I agree with Simpson J and the orders which she proposes. I also agree with the observation of Whealy JA that section 73 Crimes Act 1900 requires urgent and immediate attention by the legislature. Accordingly, I support the recommendation by Whealy JA that a copy of this decision should be taken out and forwarded by the Registrar to the Attorney-General for his urgent consideration.

		07 May 2012",2012-04-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759139,Miles v R [2012] NSWCCA 88,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1HOEBEN JA: I agree with the reasons of Justice Schmidt and with the observations of Justice Hulme. I also join in Justice Hulme's recommendation to the Department of Corrective Services that it provide reasonable assistance and facilities to allow the applicant to prepare his appeal. Otherwise I agree with the orders proposed by Justice Schmidt. The orders of the Court will be those proposed by Justice Schmidt.

2RS HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Schmidt J and substantially with her Honour's reasons. I would, however, add some remarks of my own. One of the matters referred to in s 32 of the Bail Act and which the Court is required to take into account in considering whether to grant bail is the interests of the applicant having regard to the needs of the person to be free to prepare for the person's appearance in Court or to obtain legal advice or both. Those needs are obviously greater in circumstances such as those we are informed exist here where the Legal Aid authorities have declined to assist the applicant in his appeal. Persons charged and persons convicted who have lodged an appeal are entitled to prepare their case or have their case adequately prepared for consideration by courts. 

3Recently I had occasion to grant bail to someone who would not otherwise have received it because on the evidence in that case the Corrective Services Department was not providing reasonable facilities for the applicant to prepare his case. The applicant today makes a similar complaint. He subpoenaed from the Corrective Services Department his file and, although it has not been formally tendered, in anticipation of the hearing today I skimmed through the many hundreds of pages which were there. 

4It is apparent that since December of last year the applicant has made a number of representations to the authorities for access to a legal library or cases contained therein and for time in which to prepare his appeal. Although in the documentation it is clear that to some degree the applicant's requests have received favourable treatment, it is by no means apparent that he has been provided with reasonable time and facilities. The limited evidence which the applicant put before the Court in this connection was not such as to inspire or require a response by the Corrective Services Department and accordingly I make no concluded judgment on the topic. However, what I have seen does tend to reinforce the impression I have derived in other cases that the Corrective Services Department do not provide what an outsider would regard as reasonable facilities for someone such as the applicant in the circumstances that he is in.

5The Department must realise that if the only way that an accused person or appellant can prepare his case is by being granted liberty then that is the course which the Court might have to take. 

6As I have indicated, I express no concluded view in this case. I merely wish to record that what I have seen is a cause for concern and I would urge the Department to ensure that the applicant is provided with sufficient time and sufficient facilities in which to prepare his case. That is, of course, not a suggestion that the Department has to provide the applicant with whatever in those respects he may require. Clearly the custodial authorities have other matters which they must bear in mind. 

7There is another matter to which I refer because it also has a bearing on the topic. The applicant has complained that he has been hampered in his preparation by frequent moves from one gaol to another. A study of his file suggests that the Corrective Services Department has not found the applicant an easy person to deal with. That said his custodial history shows that since 2007 he has been moved some eighteen times between one corrective institution and another and that since October of last year he has been moved six times. It is difficult to believe that this is an efficient use of gaol resources and certainly it adds support to his complaint that he has been unduly hampered in the preparation of his case. I find it hard to believe that the number of changes in his correctional services centre over the period can reasonably be justified. That said I have indicated that I agree that the appeal should be rejected.

8SCHMIDT J: The applicant seeks a review of a bail determination made by Fullerton J on 2 February 2012, under s 45(1)(b) of the Bail Act 1978. The Crown opposes bail being granted. The applicant appeared unrepresented before Fullerton J and on appeal, as he explained because he has been refused legal aid. 

9The applicant was charged with three offences under s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900, of having sexual intercourse without consent, in July 2005. In 2007, he was tried by a jury before Conlon DCJ. He was acquitted of one count and convicted of the other two. The applicant was remanded in custody and on 1 November 2007 he was sentenced to two partly accumulated prison terms of 7 years and 6 years, with non-parole periods of 5 and 4 years respectively. His earliest release date is 29 June 2012, although on his case he is unlikely then to be released on parole.

10The applicant first filed a notice of intention to appeal on 8 September 2008. By a further notice filed on 14 October 2008 the appeal was abandoned. A further notice of intention to appeal was filed on 15 February 2011 and an application for leave to appeal was filed on 11 November 2011. Thirty one grounds of appeal were there advanced, including that:

the verdict was unreasonable and unsafe; 
that the trial judge erred in law: 
in not applying 'due process' of Court procedure 
in not calling a voir dire 
in not directing the jury as to the unreliability of the complainant's evidence; in not giving a character warning; and not giving a direction in relation to delaying complaint 
in misdirecting the jury as to relationship evidence and inferences 
in allowing prejudicial, biased and irrelevant testimony to be given by Crown witnesses 
in allowing the Crown to lead witnesses and put an ex officio charge on the indictment 
in imposing a time constraint on the jury 
in not instructing the translator to repeat 'word for word' what was expressed by the complainant 
in allowing a witness to be present before giving evidence 
failure of the applicant's counsel: 
to object to irrelevant and prejudicial evidence 
in relation to principles governing a fair trial 
to cross-examine and test Crown witnesses 
to object to various matters 
to adequately rebut the Crown's expert evidence 
to explain why character evidence was not led 
to 'deprive' the applicant from testifying 
to advance certain submissions

11An affidavit of 20 October 2011 providing reasons for the grant of leave to appeal out of time accompanied the notice of appeal. There the applicant gave an extensive explanation of his circumstances prior to the commission of the offences of which he was convicted; his compliance with bail conditions prior to conviction; his experiences while in custody, including hospitalisation; his diagnosis of suffering 'schizophrenia with persecution complex'; ongoing unwanted medication up until 2009; the steps he had subsequently taken to pursue his appeal; the difficulties he had encountered; and the need for him to pursue certain legal studies, in an accounting course which he was undertaking. 

12On 15 December 2011, Hidden J refused an application for bail. On 2 February 2012, Fullerton J refused a second application. 

13Fullerton J observed in her judgment that it was not sufficient for the applicant to show that he had an arguable ground of appeal, it was necessary for him to show that his conviction will almost certainly be quashed. Her Honour noted that the applicant sought to advance 31 grounds of appeal, but she was not persuaded that any one of these grounds, even when read together, supported any prospects of success, much less high to extraordinary prospects of success. Her Honour was also not persuaded that the applicant's need to be at liberty to prosecute his appeal, because of limited facilities available in jail, justified the grant of bail. 

14The appeal is next listed before the Registrar of this Court on 10 May 2012, when a hearing date is likely to be set.

15On 17 April 2012, the applicant filed a number of documents, including a document entitled 'Application for review of Bail refusal'. 

16The applicant has filed further documents, including a summary of argument for grounds of appeal; grounds of appeal, where at one point 11 grounds are articulated and at another, 16 grounds of appeal. These raise some, but not all of the matters raised in the original grounds, as well as various other issues, including for example, complaints about a tainted police investigation, which are said to have shifted the burden of proof to the applicant; a failure to discharge the jury; and a prejudicial summing up.

17This Court has power under s 30(a) of the Bail Act to grant the applicant bail, given the pending appeal. Under s 30AA such bail may only be granted, however, if it is established that 'special or exceptional circumstances exist justifying the grant of bail'. In R v Wilson (1994) 34 NSWLR 1 it was explained by Kirby P, with whom Sheller JA agreed at 6, that 'the applicant must be most likely to succeed'. Hunt CJ agreed, adding:
""In R v Southgate (1960) 78 WN (NSW) 44, this Court, when considering an application for bail, said (at 44) that, where the guilt of the appellant has been established by the jury's verdict in what must be taken - until the contrary be shown - to have been a trial properly conducted and without error of law, it is most unusual that he should be admitted to bail pending the determination of his appeal. In Chamberlain v The Queen (No 1) (1983) 153 CLR 514, Brennan J said (at 519-520) that to grant bail pending an appeal from a conviction is to whittle away the finality of the jury's verdict
and to invest it with a provisional quality, thus attacking the central feature in the administration of criminal justice. It was for these reasons that the common law required an appellant to demonstrate special or exceptional circumstances in order to obtain bail pending his appeal; the authorities are discussed in R v Hilton (1987) 7 NSWLR 745 at 746-747, 752. It is that requirement which is now enshrined in s 30AA. 

In R v Smith (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 May 1993, unreported), I said (at 2) that, bearing in mind what was said in R v Southgate, it has to have an extraordinarily high prospect of success before a ground of appeal could even be considered on a bail application. Where the prospects of success on the appeal are put forward as a special circumstance, I said (at 2-3), what must be established is a ground of appeal which is certain to succeed - and one which can be seen without detailed argument to be certain to succeed. It is not sufficient to show a merely arguable ground of appeal, or even one which has a reasonable prospect of success. Agreement was expressed with my views in R v Olivier (Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 September 1993, unreported) at 60, by Finlay J (with whom Handley JA and Sheller JA agreed).""


18 In Petroulias v R [2010] NSWCCA 95 Barr AJ, with whom Hodgson JA and Rothman J agreed explained at [34]:

""While I appreciate that the Court must look at the aggregate effect of all the matters relied on as constituting special or exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of bail, it is worth noting that, at least where the grounds of appeal are put forward as the only or the principal factor to demonstrate special or exceptional circumstances, an applicant has to show much more than that the grounds seem arguable.""

19The matters advanced by the applicant in support of the application for bail in the written application which he made to this Court, included that he had not been given a fair hearing by Fullerton J, who had placed him at ill ease by her negative attitude, he being an indigent applicant; that her Honour had belittled him and cut him short, inhibiting him from putting his case; that she had commented that his appeal had no chance of success; and had failed to give him courtroom courtesy. He also foreshadowed that he would rely on medical evidence. 

20The applicant's complaints about the hearing before Fullerton J are not strictly relevant to the application before this Court, given that this is a fresh hearing of the application for bail (see Petroulias v R [at [13]). The effect of the provisions of s 30AA of the Bail Act, is that this Court is only empowered to grant the applicant bail if he establishes that special or exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of bail exist. The transcript of the hearing before Fullerton J was, however, put before us. 

21It is convenient to observe that the complaints advanced as to the hearing before her Honour had no foundation. Her Honour commenced by explaining to the applicant her understanding of the circumstances in which he came to make his application, and advising him as to what he had to establish, in order to succeed. She said that it would not assist him to simply recite the grounds of his appeal, but explained that he had to show, as she finally paraphrased the test, that his appeal was virtually certain to succeed . She then listened for a considerable time to the submissions which the applicant advanced, without any interruption, before advising him that a number of matters which he wished to advance were not relevant to his bail application. Before giving her decision she asked the applicant whether there was anything further which he wished to put and he advanced a submission as to his personal circumstances. In those circumstances, in so far as these matters might be considered relevant, that the applicant has a basis to complain about her Honour's approach to his application, may not be accepted. 

22The applicant's written submissions in support of the application for bail referred to various articles concerning the conduct of criminal trials, as well as numerous longstanding authorities as to the circumstances in which convictions will be set aside by an appellate court such as this, when verdicts are found to have been unsafe or unsatisfactory, the Court having made an independent assessment of the evidence. The submissions also addressed the proper approach of a jury to evidence led at a trial. The applicant also addressed the provisions of s 30 and 30AA of the Bails Act, submitting that under s 25 and s 45 of that Act, the Supreme Court's power to grant bail was unlimited. 

23The applicant relied on R v Joseph Antoun; R v Antoine Antoun [2005] NSWCCA 270 at [14] - [15], to argue that there were other circumstances, apart from the prospect of success on appeal, which warranted him being granted bail. There it was observed:

""14 It was argued on behalf of the applicants that the grant of special leave is an indicator that the appeal to the High Court ""is most likely to succeed"" and that ""there is a real prospect that the conviction might be set aside"". In our opinion this overstates the position. This Court has been reminded by the Crown that it has been said that bail pending appeal will be granted only where the ground of appeal is so strong that it is virtually ""certain to succeed"", and obviously so: R v Wilson (1994) 34 NSWLR 1. We do not accept that s30AA is so limited. 

15 The judgment which has frequently been cited was, in fact, a minority position in Wilson. In Wilson, Kirby P, with whom Sheller JA agreed, said: 

""... it will require something more than an arguable point in the Court of Criminal Appeal to warrant the provision of bail upon the ground that the applicant for bail is likely to succeed.""

It is to be noted that, in that passage, Kirby P and Sheller JA seem to envisage that there may be grounds other than the merits of the appeal which would satisfy the s30AA test. Where the application is based only on the ground of the merits of the appeal, the passage has application but these remain open to the possibility that there are potentially other circumstances that might merit the grant of bail.""


24The applicant argued that this was such a case. He submitted that a grant of leave to appeal may be considered to be an indicator that his appeal would succeed and that it would be accepted that there is a real prospect that his conviction might be set aside. The difficulty with this submission is that the applicant has not been granted such leave and thus, no such indicator exists. 

25The applicant also relied on other circumstances as warranting a grant of bail in his case, including his impending eligibility for parole; the absence of any prior criminal record; his compliance with bail conditions prior to conviction; the return of the complainant to her home overseas; and the findings of the trial judge that he had no prior record, that he was a person of good character, that he was unlikely to re-offend and that he had significant prospects of rehabilitation. He proposed bail conditions as to residence and surrender of his passport, as being appropriate in his personal circumstances, to warrant his release on bail pending the hearing of his appeal. He also relied on his experience of being frequently moved between six correctional facilities while in custody, periods of segregation; restricted phone and computer access; the lack of co-operation which he received from Departmental staff in relation to the provision of precedents and preparation of his appeal; obstructionist behaviour in not acceding to his inmate requests; and precluding him from enrolling in certain courses. The applicant subpoenaed certain documents from the Department of Corrective Services to provide a foundation of these submissions. 

26In his written submissions summarising his arguments in support of his grounds of appeal, the applicant also referred to numerous authorities, to support the alleged errors which he seeks to establish on appeal. The Crown's case was that all the applicant had done was to present contentions, many of which could be demonstrated to be palpably inaccurate, or without merit, if a proper examination of the transcript were undertaken. That exercise was not attempted, but the Crown's submissions explained why none of the grounds which the applicant addressed in his further submissions would be established, having in mind what occurred at the trial. 

The application must be refused

27In my view the application must be refused, the applicant not having met the onus which falls upon him to establish the existence of the necessary special or exceptional circumstances. 

28Under s 32(1)(b)(ii) of the Bail Act, the needs of the applicant to be free to prepare for his appearance in court or to obtain legal advice is one of the matters to be taken into account in determining an application for bail. That incarceration has a negative effect on the applicant's ability to prepare for the hearing of his appeal may well be accepted. Of itself, however, this cannot establish that the special or exceptional circumstances which s 30AA requires be shown, exist. 

29The applicant is an articulate, educated man. He has advanced lengthy, lucid submissions to support his bail application. When this is considered together with the steps which the applicant has taken to pursue his appeal and bail applications, it is not open to conclude that he has been so inhibited in putting his case, that thereby special or exceptional circumstances have been shown to exist.

30The other matters on which the applicant relied, such as his criminal history, his compliance with earlier bail conditions, the complainant's present whereabouts and his family circumstances, are all matters which would support a grant of bail, were this an ordinary bail application. These matters cannot, however, establish that special or exceptional circumstances exist. Nor has the applicant demonstrated that his appeal is likely to succeed.

31That the applicant has arguments to advance in respect of the various matters which he wishes to pursue, is apparent. The applicant submitted that the ground of appeal on which he is likely to succeed is that relating to the ex officio charge. That was a charge of which he was acquitted. Even so, he complained that as the result of the laying of that charge, the trial had been unfair. The applicant also identified other grounds likely to succeed to be that there was an unreasonable verdict and the failure to give directions in relation to delay in complaint and other matters, as well as a tainted police investigation. The applicant's written submissions are replete with authorities on which he wishes to rely to make out that and other grounds which he wishes to advance. Some of the grounds advanced may be arguable, but their merits will plainly require an examination of what in fact occurred at the trial. On the case advanced the applicant has not established that any of the grounds advanced are likely to succeed. 

32In those circumstances it must be concluded that the necessary special or exceptional circumstances have not been shown to exist and the application must be refused.

Order

33For these reasons, I would order that the application for bail be dismissed.

34I also indicate that I join in the recommendation which has been made to the Department.

2759149,R v Humphries [2012] NSWSC 419,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The offender, Ricky Leigh Humphries, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Saaid (""Sid"") Zaiter at Chinderah on 16 December 2008. This offence is one that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.

Facts

2According to the statement of facts, the principal offender was Rodney Boyd White. Mr White and Mr Zaiter were known to each other. Both were involved in the illicit drug trade and White purchased drugs from the deceased from time to time.

3White lived in a cabin in a caravan park at Chinderah with his girlfriend, Jessica Birkensleigh. In the days preceding 16 December 2008 they made preparations to vacate the cabin and move to Victoria. The Crown alleges that they intended to finance their new life in Victoria by setting up a drug deal with the deceased and then stealing the drugs from him.

4It was pursuant to this plan that arrangements were made for Mr Zaiter to meet Mr White at the cabin on 16 December. White and Birkensleigh stayed the night of 15 December at the home of a couple in Casino with whom they were friends, Stephen and Sarah Orams. In the late morning of 16 December Mr White asked Mr Orams to drive him to the cabin at Chinderah. He told Mr Orams that a drug deal was going to take place. On the way he asked that they stop in Lismore and pick up the offender. White said that the offender was going to give him a hand moving some things out of the cabin and was also to provide backup ""in case this other fellow brings any mates with him"". 

5White had contacted the offender earlier on the morning of 16 December to enlist his help. The two had known each other for a few years. White was a friend of the offender's stepfather. There is no suggestion that the offender was aware of White's plan to steal Mr Zaiter's drugs, but he did understand that his role was to provide ""backup"".

6The three men arrived at the caravan park sometime between 10.30 and 11.00 am. White and the offender alighted and entered the caravan park whilst Orams drove to a location at the front of the park and waited.

7After about an hour, White walked out of the caravan park and spoke to Orams. At about this time, the deceased arrived in a Land Rover Discovery. White joined him in the vehicle and the pair drove into the caravan park to White's cabin.

8Sometime in the early afternoon, a resident of a nearby cabin heard the sounds of loud music, yelling and thumping coming from White's cabin. She said that it sounded like someone was having a fight. After a short time the noise stopped.

9Mr Orams received a text message to drive around to the back of the caravan park. There he saw Mr White and the offender walking out. White was carrying a bag like an overnight bag, which he placed in the boot of the car, a station wagon. Both men entered the car; White in the front passenger seat and the offender behind him.

10White said, ""Let's go. Just don't speed."" Mr Orams replied, ""No worries. How did you go?"" White replied, ""Not good. I just bashed the cunt and I think he's dead."" Orams replied, ""Fuck off, you're joking."" White looked at him and shook his head. Orams turned and looked at the offender who nodded his head in confirmation. Orams asked, ""What have you done with him?"" White replied, ""I tied him up and put tape over his mouth in case he wakes up."" Mr Orams observed that the offender was very quiet and kept to himself, not saying anything. It appeared to Orams that the offender was in a state of shock.

11Mr Orams drove White and the offender towards Murwillumbah. White contacted Todd Serone, described as being a ""friend/associate"" of White, and asked him to get a tow truck and pick up a car that was parked at the front of the cabin which was blocking traffic in the caravan park. White then telephoned another associate, Peter Elefsen, having obtained his number from the offender, and asked him to meet them on the road between Kyogle and Murwillumbah with a can of fuel.

12As the three men drove towards Kyogle there was very little conversation. The offender was described as being ""virtually wordless"". Mr Orams said that the offender was ""extremely quiet and reserved and withdrawn, almost as though he were in a state of shock"". 

13After some time, White asked the offender whether he knew of anywhere a body could be disposed of without being found. The offender indicated that he knew of a couple of places, including a cliff with a large drop off. 

14Eventually the three men met up with Elefsen on the road from Green Pigeon, where Elefsen lived, to the Murwillumbah-Kyogle road. At White's direction, Mr Orams took possession of Mr Elefsen's car and drove it home to Casino. Elefsen joined White and the offender in the station wagon and drove back towards Murwillumbah. Elefsen noted that the offender was sitting in the back of the car, not saying anything during the journey.

15White told Elefsen, ""I've bashed this cunt and taken his car for payment. That's the car we're picking up."" According to Elefsen, the offender was ""like a stunned mullet in the back seat and didn't say anything"". He too formed the opinion that the offender appeared to be in a state of shock.

16At a point along the Murwillumbah-Kyogle road the station wagon passed a tow truck with the deceased's Land Rover on the back. The tow truck was being driven by Mr Alan Waters, accompanied by Todd Serone. In order to attract their attention, White produced a small handgun and fired a shot out of the passenger side window. The two vehicles stopped. White got out and spoke to Serone. 

17The station wagon and the tow truck were then driven to a disused quarry near the township of Wadeville. The deceased's car was taken off the tow truck and driven into the quarry. White and Serone searched it, pulling the trim from the inside of the doors from which blocks of ""speed"" were then removed. White then poured petrol over the car, petrol that had been brought by Elefsen. He then set fire to the car as Serone returned to the tow truck. Elefsen and the offender were standing some distance away from the car as this occurred. The three men then got back into the station wagon and drove back towards Murwillumbah.

18Elefsen stopped the car within the Murwillumbah township. The tow truck was already there. After a conversation between White and Serone, it was determined that Elefsen and the offender would go in the tow truck to the airport at Coolangatta in order to hire another car that could be used to retrieve the body of the deceased from the cabin. A car was hired and Serone, Elefsen and the offender then went to the cabin.

19The deceased was found in the cabin, lying on his side with his hands tied behind his back with black zip ties. There was tape, similar to gaffer tape, across his mouth and nose which made it impossible for him to breath.

20The offender cut out a square piece of carpet which had blood stains on it. Serone wrapped the body in a tarpaulin. Serone and the offender then picked up the body and carried it out to the hire car while Elefsen carried out the carpet.

21The hire car was driven to Murwillumbah and then on to Uki where White was waiting. Elefsen and the offender got into White's car and the two cars were then driven towards the Border Ranges.

22The cars stopped about 25 minutes later. The deceased's body was transferred to White's car. Serone then departed in the hire car. White, Elefsen and the offender proceeded towards the Border Ranges National Park. White stopped the car at the park entrance and, with the assistance of the other two men, the body was put down the side of a bank and covered with sticks and leaves.

23White had earlier secreted by the side of the road a black sports bag containing the drugs that he had stolen from the deceased. The three men returned to that location and White recovered the bag. He then announced that he wanted to move the body further into the bush because he believed that his DNA would be all over it. It was about 11.00 pm by this stage. White insisted that the others assist him in retrieving the body and taking it to an area known as The Pinnacle.

24The body was retrieved and taken to The Pinnacle. It was carried up to a viewing platform along the top of the mountain. The offender and Elefsen assisted White in unwrapping the body from the tarpaulin. White removed the cable ties and masking tape and then poured petrol over the body, ostensibly to destroy his DNA, before pushing the body over the edge. At various points along the journey away from The Pinnacle, items associated with the body were burnt.

25There was a gathering at the home of Peter Elefsen at Green Pigeon on the night of 17 December 2008. The offender spoke with Mr Elefsen alone at one point and the latter was later to recall:

""Rick told me that he went over to the cabin to help Rob [a reference to White] move some furniture and to make sure the deal went alright. Rick told me there was going to be a drug deal. Rick said he was waiting in the cabin when Rob and the man [the deceased] come into the cabin. Rick was in the toilet and Rob and Zaiter were in the lounge room. Rob and Zaiter got in a scuffle in the lounge room. Rick came into the lounge room with a bat. Zaiter went to grab the bat from Rick. Rick hit Zaiter with the bat. Rick and Rob got Zaiter on the ground. Zaiter was still fighting Rick and Rob. Rob jumped onto Zaiter's chest, pinning his arms down with his knees. Rob then started punching Zaiter in the head until he stopped and it was all over. There was only Rick and Rob in the cabin when this all happened. Rick said that just before Rob jumped on Zaiter's chest, Zaiter said, 'Rodney, you won't get out of here alive'. Rick said that was the last thing that Zaiter said.""

26It is agreed between the parties that the offender should be sentenced in accordance with the terms of that confession.

27The police investigation commenced on 17 December 2008. It was quickly concluded that the deceased may have been killed as a result of a drug deal.

28The offender was interviewed on two occasions on 15 September 2009 after his arrest. He was less than completely truthful in both interviews. He did not disclose his involvement in the events at the cabin, nor in the disposal of the body of the deceased. After the first interview he disclosed that he had a conversation with White about an area where a body could be disposed of. He informed White that anywhere in the Border Ranges was probably suitable. He maintained that he did not direct White to any location and said that at no time did he see a body.

29Rodney White and Jessica Birkensleigh were arrested on 4 September 2009 in Victoria.

30Peter Elefsen was arrested on 15 September 2009 but eventually co-operated with the police investigation. As a result of his information, police searched the cliff face of The Pinnacle. On 16 December 2009, the partial remains of the skeleton of the deceased were located. There was so little recovered that it was not possible for the precise mechanism of death to be determined.

31Todd Serone was arrested on 9 March 2010.

32On 30 April 2012 a jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of White for murder; Serone for accessory after the fact to murder; and Birkensleigh for robbery (accessory before the fact).

33It is the agreed position of the parties that the offender's liability for manslaughter is established on the basis that he took part in an unlawful and dangerous act, namely an assault of the deceased by himself and White while he, the offender, was armed with a weapon. Further, it is agreed that this assault substantially contributed to the death of the deceased in that it caused him to fall to the ground, whereupon he was bashed, either to death, or into unconsciousness and thereafter suffocated by White.

34The Crown accepts that the offender did not intend to cause death or grievous bodily harm and did not, at the time of joining in the assault, foresee the possibility that White would form such an intention. Otherwise, the offender would be guilty of murder, which is not the case.

Seriousness of the offence

35Manslaughter is a crime that can be committed in a very wide range of circumstances. Further, there are a number of ways that a person can be responsible for manslaughter: there can be the commission of an unlawful and dangerous act, as here; or gross criminal negligence; or a charge of murder can be reduced to manslaughter when there is provocation, substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind or excessive self-defence. Also among the variables in determining seriousness are matters such as whether the offender acted alone, or in company; whether a weapon was used; or whether the violence used was planned, or foreseen as a possibility.

36Regardless of the way in which the offence is committed, or the legal basis for an offender's culpability, the starting point in assessing the seriousness of an offence of manslaughter is to recognise that at its heart is the unlawful taking of the life of a fellow human being.

37Mr Button SC, on behalf of the offender, acknowledged that manslaughter is a grave offence but he submitted that this case represents a less serious example of it. On the other hand, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the case was, objectively, more serious than that and should be found to be at least in the middle of the range.

38Factors relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence include that the offender was involved in the incident after accompanying White to the cabin knowing that a drug deal was proposed. Whilst he did not know of White's plan to rob the deceased of his drugs, he was aware that it was his role to act as a ""backup"" to Mr White in the event that there was any violence.

39The offence was committed jointly, in the manner set out above, but it is clearly the case that Mr White was the predominant assailant and it was he who initiated the violence. However, the offender armed himself with a weapon and joined in the attack. He struck the deceased with the bat and participated with White in bringing the deceased to the ground. 

40Mr Button acknowledged that the offender's role in assisting in the disposal of the deceased's body might be taken into account in aggravation ""to some degree"". That acknowledgement was realistic because the circumstances in which the offender participated in the retrieval of the body from the cabin at Chinderah and then in the subsequent unceremonious dumping of it, first in one bushland location and then another, cannot be ignored. He is to be particularly condemned for his participation in the offering of the final indignity to the deceased in having his naked body pushed off a cliff into deep and rugged bushland. 

41I do, however, accept that White was the primary participant and leader in these activities, and I also accept the descriptions of Mr Orams and Mr Elefsen that the offender was in shock, said little, and, it would seem, blindly followed White's lead. I will shortly be mentioning something about the offender's personality that is relevant to this conclusion. I also have the advantage of having presided over the trial of White and have observed him giving evidence. I have no doubt that he is a most belligerent, arrogant and manipulative person.

42Notwithstanding this secondary role played by the offender, participating in joint violence upon a lone man, with the use of a weapon, in circumstances in which the offender attended the scene to play the role of a backup in a drug deal puts the seriousness of the offence on a higher level than Mr Button's submission suggested. It is not as high as the Crown Prosecutor submitted, but not far from it.

Subjective features

43The evidence before me as to the offender's personal circumstances comprises a report by Ms Anna Robilliard, forensic psychologist; an affidavit by the offender; custody work records; vocational education certificates and records of other courses undertaken while in custody; and a number of testimonials.

44The offender was born in June 1983 and was 25 years old at the time of the offence.

45His mother and father separated before he was born. His father is Aboriginal and the offender describes having great pride in his cultural heritage. However, he has had no contact with his biological father, other than on one brief occasion when he was 11 years old. Although he is not interested in establishing contact with his father, he states in his affidavit that he is looking forward to meeting his father's other children and their families.

46Shortly after his parents' separation, the offender's mother began a relationship with Anthony Simmons. Together the family moved from Sydney to Findon Creek, just outside Kyogle, when the offender was 10 years old. The offender describes Mr Simmons as a great support and as a father-figure, and he has remained so even after he and the offender's mother separated in 2003. 

47When the offender was 17 years old, he began a relationship with Yasmin Ford. Ms Ford fell pregnant when they were both still in high school and the offender left school in order to find work and support his son. The relationship broke down two years later, around the same time his mother and Mr Simmons were in the process of separating.

48Ms Robilliard records that the offender began smoking cannabis at this time to deal with emotional stress from the family breakdown. By the age of 24 he was using cannabis almost daily. Since then he has attempted to stop using cannabis with limited success. He has a minimal history of other illicit drug use.

49The offender has maintained regular contact with his son. For the past 7 years he has been in a relationship with Ms Kylie Roberts and has been involved in raising her two children. At the time of the offence, the offender was living in Lismore with his mother. He was acting as her carer after a head injury left her requiring care and assistance. His aunt has taken over this role following his incarceration. 

50The offender has suffered a number of physical injuries, including in 2005 when he slipped and fell from a second storey deck while working and landed on his feet. X-rays showed that he had fractured both his heels. He complains that he has had trouble securing appropriate shoes while on remand and that the medication he has been prescribed does little to alleviate the persistent pain.

51The offender has been consistently employed since leaving school, save for a few of periods where he was unable to work due to injury. He has been employed as a labourer and in the construction industry, as well as working with a painter and in auto mechanic workshops. 

52Whilst in custody at Parklea Correctional Centre, the offender spent two years employed in the internal maintenance department and has received positive reports from corrective services staff in relation to this work. He has also completed a number of vocational training programs and other courses while on remand. He told Ms Robilliard that he wants to complete his Higher School Certificate.

53Ms Robilliard reports that the offender has thought a great deal about the death of the deceased and has accepted his responsibility. In his affidavit, he states that he accepts ""a person has died and I was involved in his death"", and that ""[h]is death is dreadful."" He also said that it is the ""first and last thing I think about each day"", and ""I am sure that people loved him, that he could have had kids that loved him... There are no words to describe how this makes me feel.""

54I was not provided with the offender's criminal or custodial history. However, it was common ground that he has no prior criminal record and has not been the subject of any prison disciplinary charges whilst in custody.

55I received a number of testimonials from friends and members of the Kyogle community in support of the offender. They describe a polite individual with a mature attitude to his family responsibilities. The authors also speak of a variety of other positive qualities. 

56Psychometric testing by Ms Robilliard revealed that the offender has a marked ""dependent personality style"". Her description of such a personality includes that the person is likely to be ""extremely submissive and cooperative and likely to cover up any unpleasant emotions out of a fear of being abandoned or rejected"". I have taken this into account in my assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, it being clear to me that the offender was acting largely under the domination of the manipulative personality of Rodney White.

Plea of guilty

57The offence was committed on 16 December 2008 and the offender was arrested on 15 September 2009. A committal hearing did not take place until March 2011. It would seem that the delay was largely because the proceedings concerning the offender were joined with those concerning others, including White, Serone and Birkensleigh. The magistrate discharged him at the conclusion of the hearing in respect of charges of murder and manslaughter, but committed him for trial on a charge of being an accessory after the fact to murder.

58The Director of Public Prosecutions subsequently determined that proceedings for murder should be re-instituted by way of ex officio indictment. Counsel for the offender was made aware of which Crown Prosecutor was to be briefed in the matter at the end of September 2011. Discussions commenced in early November 2011 between counsel as to the possibility of the Crown accepting a plea of guilty to manslaughter. While these discussions were current, the offender was arraigned on 11 November 2011, pleaded not guilty to murder, and a trial date of 12 March 2012 was fixed.

59At the end of November 2011, counsel for the offender formally notified the Crown Prosecutor that the offender would plead guilty to manslaughter. A Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions responded on 10 February 2012 to the effect that such a plea would be accepted. The matter was listed before me as the trial judge on 24 February 2012, whereupon the plea was entered.

60Senior counsel for the offender submitted that the sentence should be reduced by 25 per cent on account of the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. It was acknowledged that a plea entered after arraignment in this Court would very rarely attract such a reduction but the circumstances in this case were said to be exceptional. It could not be expected that the offender would plead guilty in the Local Court, particularly when the result of the proceedings there resulted in discharge. It was submitted that after the ex officio indictment was filed and once a Crown Prosecutor was brief, discussions soon followed which resulted in the plea being entered.

61The submissions for the offender put it in terms that it could not be expected that a person who has been discharged at committal to then plead guilty in the Local Court to the charge. That, of course, is correct. But it is quite different to the question whether the person, who now acknowledges that on 16 December 2008 he committed the offence of manslaughter, could have pleaded guilty at any time between being charged on 15 September 2009 and the conclusion of the committal proceedings on 16 March 2011.

62I will take into account that discussions that culminated in the plea took place in November 2011. It was no fault of the offender that the plea was not then entered until 24 February 2012. I propose to allow a reduction of sentence for the utilitarian benefit of the plea in the order of 15 per cent.

Other mitigating factors

63There are a number of other mitigating factors which I am required to take in to account in sentencing the offender. The absence of a prior criminal record and the content of the testimonials demonstrate that the offender has been a person of good character.

64Consistent with his plea of guilty, the offender has demonstrated that he has accepted responsibility for the death of the deceased and has shown real remorse. This is evident from his affidavit and his interview with Ms Robilliard. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these statements.

65It was submitted by counsel for the offender that his prospects for rehabilitation are very high. Ms Robilliard supports this conclusion, stating that the offender's ""risk of reoffending is minimal."" While it is difficult to predict future behaviour, the support he has from friends and community members, his commitment to family responsibilities, and his good behaviour and diligence at work while on remand lead me to find that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. 

66It is now more than two and half years since the offender was arrested. Part of this delay is because of the fact that the proceedings concerning the offender were joined with, and to some extent dependent upon, the proceedings concerning other offenders. The sentence will be backdated to the date of the offender's arrest. Another way in which this delay is relevant is because it has meant that a significant period of the time in which the offender is mandatorily detained will have been as an unsentenced remand prisoner. He has not had the benefit of classification within the correctional environment that would have had the very real prospect that his custodial conditions would have been less onerous, particularly for an offender who has had no prior involvement with the criminal justice system. I will take this into account.

67I will also take into account that following the entry of the plea of guilty, the offender was transferred to Grafton Correctional Centre where he has been kept in more restricted custodial conditions.

Other sentencing considerations

68As the Crown Prosecutor submitted, general deterrence is an important consideration in sentencing in a case such as this. Those who are prepared to lend assistance to drug dealers doing drug deals, even if only in a secondary role as ""backup"" in case of trouble, must know that significant punishment awaits them upon detection.

69Personal deterrence also has a role to play but, given my findings as to the offender's good prospects of rehabilitation and unlikelihood of further offending, it is of minimal significance.

70Punishment, denunciation, recognition of the harm done and making the offender accountable for his actions are all relevant considerations, as also is the countervailing consideration of promoting the offender's rehabilitation.

71In the latter respect, I accept the submission by Mr Button that there are special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. After his first period in prison, the offender will need a longer period of parole supervision to assist his settlement back into community. The degree to which I can reduce the non-parole period is limited by the need to maintain appropriate proportionality with the seriousness of the offence.

72I was referred to a number of sentencing decisions, at first instance and on appeal, as well as to the sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission. I have found these to be of some utility, but this is limited by what I said in one of the cases to which I was referred, which was that there is no established pattern of sentencing for manslaughter committed in the circumstances of this case.

Sentence

Convicted.

Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 2 years 3 months.

The sentence will date from 15 September 2009. The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 14 June 2013. The total term of the sentence will expire on 14 September 2015.

That is a total term of 6 years. Without the offender's plea of guilty, it would have been a sentence of 7 years.

2759163,R v Waszczuk [2012] NSWSC 380,"Judgment

1This is a further enquiry held pursuant to s 29 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act"") in respect of the Accused Martin Waszczuk.

Background

2The Accused, who was born on 10 August 1983 and is now aged 28 years, killed his father Jan Waszczuk on 25 May 2009, with whom he lived, by stabbing him with a kitchen knife and inflicting some 24 stab wounds to his upper back, chest, neck and head. 

3After making some vain attempts to clean up what he had done the Accused rang 000 and informed the operator that he had murdered his father. The police attended at the residence, and having seen the Deceased on the kitchen floor, arrested the Accused. When asked if he knew why he was being arrested he replied ""Yes, murder one"". He was taken to Hornsby Police Station and participated in an electronically recorded interview with the police. During the course of the interview he admitted to having stabbed the Deceased multiple times. He gave a description of his attempts to clean up the scene and then decided it was futile so he decided to ring the police. 

4When asked by the police about his state of mind or intention at the time of stabbing the Deceased he declined to comment. He declined to say whether he had on earlier occasions entertained thoughts of killing the Deceased or whether he believed what he had done was wrong or whether he had any remorse for what he had done. 

5The Accused had previously been committed to a mental health institution on two occasions and following discharge on the second occasion he had remained in the care of the mental health and other medical staff associated with Hornsby Hospital. He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

6He was charged with murder. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court and confirmed that plea on arraignment in this Court. 

7R A Hulme J undertook a sentence hearing and during the course of that hearing became concerned as to whether the Accused was in fact fit to plead. His Honour stood the matter over to enable a report to be obtained from Justice Health. Before the sentence hearing resumed on 24 March 2011 reports were obtained from Professor Greenberg and Dr Bruce Westmore. 

8His Honour then considered those reports and other material and formed the view under s 10 of the Act that an enquiry ought to be held as to the Accused's unfitness to be tried. With the agreement of the parties (the Accused was then represented by lawyers) his Honour immediately embarked upon the enquiry. Having done so he determined that the Accused was unfit to be tried - see R v Waszczuk [2011] NSWSC 212.

9On 30 August 2011 the Mental Health Review Tribunal gave its determination on a review conducted on 9 June 2011 pursuant to s 46(1) of the Act. The Tribunal found, having regard to the expert oral and written evidence presented by Dr Bhattacharyya and the treating team, and the fitness criteria referred to in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48 and Kesavarajah v R (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 245-246, that the Accused was fit to plead to the offence with which he is charged.

10Pursuant to s 29 of the Act the matter came back before Adams J on 2 December 2011 for a further enquiry as to the Accused's fitness. The Crown Prosecutor sought an adjournment from Adams J because there was no further material available to his Honour than had been available either to RA Hulme J or to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. The adjournment was also sought because of a letter that had been written by the Accused (who had withdrawn his instructions from his solicitors) to the DPP. The Crown wished a copy of the letter to be placed before Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg. The Accused indicated that he was not prepared to be re-examined by those Doctors. The matter was, therefore, adjourned to a date to be fixed so that further reports could be obtained from those Doctors after they had read the Accused's letter.
11Before the matter could be re-fixed for a further enquiry the Tribunal became bound under s 46 to conduct a further review. This it did on 8 December 2011 and issued its determination on 21 December 2011. The Tribunal again found that the Accused was fit to be tried. It did so on the basis of the expert oral and written evidence presented by Dr Eugene Ho and Dr Bhattacharyya. 

12The matter came before me for the conduct of a further enquiry on 19 April 2012. The Accused appeared for himself. Further reports were tendered from Dr Westmore of 3 January 2012 and from Professor Greenberg of 6 January 2012. At the time of preparing their reports both Doctors had available to them the letter written by the Accused a little time before 25 November 2011 and the material that was before the Tribunal together with its determinations. In addition, both psychiatrists gave concurrent evidence before me.

13The starting point for the further enquiry is the presumption contained in s 15 of the Act as follows:

15. It is to be presumed:

(a)that a person who has, in accordance with this Part, been found to be unfit to be tried for an offence continues to be unfit to be tried for the offence until the contrary is, on the balance of probabilities, determined to be the case; 

...

14The presumption operates because of the finding of RA Hulme J at the enquiry he conducted under the Part of the Act (Part 2) in which s 15 is to be found. The determinations conducted by the Mental Health Review Tribunal are carried out under Div 2 of Part 5 of the Act and they do not affect the presumption found in s 15. Although it is appropriate that I have regard to those determinations, the further enquiry must be conducted on the basis of all of the evidence before this Court at that further enquiry. 

15Both psychiatrists accept that the Accused is acutely mentally ill and that he suffers from schizophrenia which is not controlled at the present time, whether because he is not compliant with his medication (and there appears to be some evidence of that) or because his condition is treatment-resistant. 

16Both psychiatrists considered that the letter written by the Accused showed Thought Disorder, which is a symptom of a psychotic illness. The psychiatrists considered, however, that for the most part the Accused's speech patterns did not reflect formal Thought Disorder. Professor Greenberg explains this by saying that because the Accused is intelligent and is very guarded and suspicious in his manner he has the ability to appear coherent by way of speech. However, when his guard is down and he is left alone to his own devices, his written language highlights the underlying thought confusion and incoherence of his thoughts. 

17The difference between the two psychiatrists in their reports concerns whether the Accused is fit to plead. Both of them accept that he is fit to plead in relation to most of the requirements of Presser. The difference between them concerns his ability to instruct his lawyers or communicate his version of the facts. 

18Dr Westmore's conclusions in his latest report are these:

The issues recently raised in relation to Mr Waszczuk are very challenging both from a psychiatric and, I suspect, a legal perspective. It is quite clear, I think, that he cannot give instructions in the written form but, at the same time, I think it is likely he can give instructions verbally. His inability to give instructions in the written form is different from a person who may be illiterate and cannot write because of a lack of education. In this particular case, he cannot write clearly because of his mental illness. His mental illness however is not obviously impacting on his capacity to express himself verbally.

...

In relation to his fitness and in the absence of any additional information from his previous legal representatives, in particular what their views were about his ability to provide verbal instructions and what reasons he gave, if any, for dismissing them, then I am of the view that Mr Waszczuk remains mentally ill but fit from a Presser perspective. Ultimately however his fitness, specifically his ability to give instructions, will need to be considered from a legal perspective, with the question being, what weight should be given to an individual's ability to provide verbal instructions as opposed to their ability to provide written instructions.

19On the other hand, Professor Greenberg's opinion in his report of 6 January 2012 is as follows:

I remain of the opinion that Mr Waszczuk remains unfit to stand trial and unfit to plead at this time. As stated in my previous psychiatric report on 21 February 2011, Mr Waszczuk understands numerous of the criteria for fitness to plead and stand trial, for example, he understands the nature of the charges and understands in a cognitive manner, the availability of a defence of not guilty by reason of mental illness. He has a capacity to exercise his right if required to do so, to challenge the jurors and understands in a cognitive sense the nature of the proceedings that is enquiry into the veracity of allegations against him. He understands the roles of various parties in Court, including his lawyer and Judge, Jury, witnesses and Crown. However this is a cognitive understanding when it relates to external people and not personally or directly related to him and his psychotic thinking.

My concern has always been that Mr Waszczuk refuses to co-operate and is unable to give his version of the facts. He acknowledges the act but refuses to discuss his underlying motivations, thoughts and reasoning at that time of the alleged offence (mens reas). He continues to suffer from acute psychotic symptoms, namely unsystematised delusional beliefs and Thought Disorder (incoherence of thought). My concerns are also therefore related to the fact that because of his mental state he is not able to make his defence and not able to instruct his counsel or communicate his version of the facts to his legal counsel.

I therefore remain of the opinion that on the balance of probabilities, he remains unfit to plead and stand trial at this time.

20The requirements from Presser are most conveniently summarised by RS Hulme J in Robinson v R ([2008] NSWCCA 64 at [24] as follows:

A person accused needs to be able:

(i)to understand what it is that he is charged with;

(ii)to plead to the charge;

(iii)to exercise his right of challenge;

(iv)to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely, that it is an enquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with; 

(v)to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all of the various court formalities;

(vi)to understand ... the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him;

(vii)to make his defence or answer to the charge.

As RS Hulme J noted at [25], Smith J in Presser expanded the final element by indicating that it included giving any necessary instructions to counsel, deciding what defence to rely on and making an accused's defence and version of the facts known to counsel and the Court.

21It is in relation to this aspect that Professer Greenberg has doubts concerning the Accused's fitness. Dr Westmore agrees that if the Accused is to represent himself there would be doubts about his fitness in relation to this area. 

22Dr Westmore's doubts in relation to his fitness appear to have arisen from two matters. The first was his Thought Disorder. He said that he has never seen Thought Disorder so dramatically displayed as in this particular case. The second was the fact that he remains very mentally ill with little or no insight into that illness, and the illness at the present time appears to be treatment-resistant. 

23In my opinion the evidence establishes on the balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff is currently unfit to plead. My reasons for reaching this conclusion are those following. 

24First, the evidence of Professor Greenberg is that because of the Accused's mental state he is not able to make his defence and not able to instruct any legal representatives or communicate to them his version of the facts. Although Professor Greenberg appears to accept that the Accused refuses to discuss his underlying motivations, thoughts and reasoning at the time of the alleged offence, this appears to be because he continues to suffer from acute psychotic symptoms, namely unsystematised delusional beliefs and Thought Disorder.

25In his earlier report of 13 December 2010 Professor Greenberg set out the enquiries he made of the Accused concerning his version of what happened when he killed his father. The reasons the Accused gave for not providing other than a concrete factual version of what physically occurred caused Professor Greenberg to have concerns about whether he was able to give his version of the facts and instruct his lawyers. He went on to say:

Should Mr Waszczuk be unable to disclose under solicitor/client privilege his motivation and reasoning for his behaviour at the time period surrounding the alleged offence, I would have serious concerns that he does not have the capacity to give his version of the facts because of ongoing delusional and possible (sic) paranoid delusional beliefs and/or grandiose beliefs. In such a situation, I would have concerns that he would not be able to make his defence and with counsel, to instruct his counsel and to communicate his version of the facts. In such a scenario he therefore would in my view would (sic) be unfit to plead and stand trial.

Professor Greenberg reinforced that opinion in his oral evidence by saying that it is because the Accused is at the present time suffering from an acute mental illness that he cannot give his version of the facts.

26Secondly, although Dr Westmore was of the opinion that, generally speaking, the Accused satisfied the Presser requirements, a number of features might produce a conclusion that he was not fit to plead. The most significant was that if the Accused remains unrepresented he would not satisfy the requirement of an ability to make his defence to the charge. Dr Westmore was particularly of that opinion because he had heard the Accused's opening address to the Court at this present enquiry. That address, both the psychiatrists thought, demonstrated some Thought Disorder in his speech. When each had previously seen him on a one to one basis they had concluded that he did not demonstrate Thought Disorder in his speech patterns. 

27Dr Westmore thought that what he observed of the Accused at this enquiry caused him to conclude that his Thought Disorder would be a major impediment in terms of his making a defence without proper professional representation.

28Dr Westmore thought also that if the formal Thought Disorder became prominent in the Accused's speech (as happened to some extent in the statement he made to the Court in front of the psychiatrists) Dr Westmore thought that that would compromise his ability to give instructions. I interpolate here that if the accused was represented and was required to provide written instructions to his lawyers (for example, an instruction that he would plead guilty) then issues associated with the Thought Disorder would arise.

29Dr Westmore was also concerned because not only did he conclude that the Accused was acutely mentally ill but that the Accused furthermore did not accept psychiatric opinion that he was ill. He thought that was at least a potential, rather than absolute, impediment to his being able to present a defence. He thought also that to the extent that the Accused was at the point of having an acute episode in his illness he would not be able to give instructions in order to represent himself. 

30Dr Westmore thought that if at the time of his trial he was delusional with the result that the Accused thought that he did not have to provide any explanation about what happened at the time of the killing or any description of what happened, that might cause a doubt about his fitness to plead.

31Thirdly, the Accused made it clear that he had chosen not to be legally represented and would not be legally represented because he was dissatisfied with the fact that Legal Aid accepted the view put forward about his mental health. This was a further indication of the Accused not accepting that he had a mental illness. The result is that many of the concerns and fears raised by Dr Westmore will be realised and the Accused would, therefore, be unfit to plead in Dr Westmore's view. 

32Fourthly, as I have mentioned, the Accused appeared unrepresented at the enquiry. He made two statements to the Court. The first of these was in the presence of the psychiatrists who, as I have said, commented upon it for the purpose of their opinions. The psychiatrists agreed that there was a measure of Thought Disorder in that statement. In it the Accused asked me to bring an end to the present proceedings on the basis that there was a jurisdictional issue that meant that any proceedings against him should be conducted in Poland. He said he had been in touch with Polish authorities in this regard. He also tendered a handwritten statement and a sealed envelope addressed:

To whom it may concern 
@ Microsoft USA c/o the Supreme Court

He did not consent either to the Crown Prosecutor or to me opening the envelope to read the material which he nevertheless wanted to become an exhibit in the enquiry.

33Although the Accused conducted himself in a polite and tempered manner he interjected on a number of occasions while the Crown Prosecutor was both asking questions of the psychiatrists and when he was addressing me. It was necessary for me to explain on a number of occasions that it was inappropriate for the Accused to interrupt or make interjection in the way he did. Ordinarily, the interjection was for the purpose of making a statement contrary to a question asked (he appeared to think that the questions put to the psychiatrists were statements of fact) or submissions made by the Crown Prosecutor.

34Despite the way he conducted himself I have some considerable doubts by reason of what the Accused said in his statements to the Court that he properly understood what he needed to respond to in the psychiatric evidence presented. He appeared to understand that it was necessary to answer what Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg said but he did so in a way that appeared to be irrational. An example of this is what follows. He said this:

In terms of a final summary or commentary on the opinion of Drs Westmore and Greenberg, I put forward in this paper here, which we can read if we have to go there in terms of assessing textual material, it can be read verbatim, but it is not an issue. But one of the points I made there, are either of those doctors qualified to distinguish between a text such as Delusion and Schizophrenia, which is a post modern text with academic credentials and professional level of academic theory versus a so called pseudo intellectual or psychotic text versus other texts such as those with psychedelic theory or new age texts or alternatively other genres, and I would claim that neither of those doctors is qualified to make a distinction between those texts as to pseudo intellectual, psychotic or other status of the material based on the clinical scheme as available which would be inadequate to the case and it would be my claim that the textual material is thus out of the range of Drs Greenberg or Westmore to diagnose and the comment or the opinions of Drs Greenberg and Westmore would tend to assess their own level of conceptual performance with respect to the utterances or material presented rather than any objective assessment of that material. Hence my recourse to a third party to assess the texts, not only the texts presented here, but also via a third party in an overseas jurisdiction as presented to your Honour today. So I believe that would be a more constructive route to pursue and a more objective route and a legally valid and viable route for the continuation of this case for it to progress forward and arrive at some resolution.

35My own observations of the Accused during this enquiry reinforced my acceptance of the opinions of Professor Greenberg and Dr Westmore with regard to the Accused's fitness to plead. 

36Finally, it is necessary to say something about the course of events in this matter. It was during the course of a sentencing hearing that RA Hulme J became sufficiently concerned about whether the Accused was fit to plead that, having obtained reports from Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg, he embarked upon the original enquiry under the Act. He proceeded to find that the Accused was unfit to plead principally on the basis of Professor Greenberg's opinion, but also having regard to the concerns that Dr Westmore also expressed.

37On the further enquiry that I have conducted, I have also chiefly reached my conclusion based on the earlier reports of Professor Greenberg and the most recent reports from both him and Dr Westmore. 

38In the determination of the Tribunal of 21 December 2011 there was nothing in the exhibits attached to the determination to suggest that the opinion of Professor Greenberg was before the Tribunal. There appeared to be evidence from Dr Bhattacharyya and Dr Ho who seemed to agree with Dr Westmore's conclusion that the Accused was fit to plead. It is apparent from the conclusion on page 4 of the determination that it was their evidence formed without apparent regard to Professor Greenberg's evidence, nor to what RA Hulme J had said concerning Dr Westmore's evidence in his judgment. 

39In the earlier determination of the Tribunal of 30 August 2011 the exhibits disclose that Professor Greenberg's report of 13 December 2010 was considered, as was RA Hulme J's judgment of 24 March 2011. Nevertheless, apart from passing reference to RA Hulme J's judgment in the reasons for its determination the very concerns of Professor Greenberg that led to RA Hulme J's finding of unfitness were not mentioned at all. The Tribunal's determination was reached based on the evidence of Dr Bhattacharyya and the team who agreed with Dr Westmore's conclusion. 

40I mention these matters only because it would be unfortunate if, in the light of my present determination, the Mental Health Review Tribunal when it conducted its future reviews gave no consideration to the basis for this Court's determination on two occasions that the Accused was not fit to plead. The result would be that the matter would bounce backwards and forwards by reason of ss 29 and 45 of the Act. 

41Accordingly, I make the following orders:

1.I find that the Accused Martin Jan Waszczuk is unfit to be tried for the offence of the murder of Jan Waszczuk on 25 May 2009.

2.In accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I refer this matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 

3.Pursuant to s 14(b)(iii) of that Act, I remand the Accused in custody pending the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s 16 of that Act.

4.I direct the Court Registry to provide the following documentation to the Tribunal:

(a)A copy of this finding.
(b)A copy of any orders made for detention or bail.
(c)A transcript of these proceedings.
(d)A copy of Exhibit A at this enquiry being the Crown papers which include:

(i)A copy of any psychiatric reports tendered to the Court during these proceedings, and 

(ii)The Crown Case Statement.

(e)The other exhibits tendered at the enquiry.

		04 May 2012",2012-05-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759175,Police v O'Brien [2012] NSWLC 7,"Judgment

Introduction
1This matter concerns the sole legal issue of whether a pair of scissors is a ""blade"" and therefore a ""knife"" within the meaning of ss 3 and 11C(1) of the Summary Offences Act 1988 (""the Act""). The accused is charged with the offence of custody of knife in public place contrary to s 11C(1) of the Act. The Court Attendance Notice does not particularise the type of knife.

2On 12 December 2011 at Central Local Court the accused pleaded guilty to a number of offences including the offence of custody of knife in public place. Upon the facts being presented to the Court it refused to accept the plea of guilty because the facts recorded that the knife the subject of the charge was a pair of scissors. This court had previously held in an ex tempore judgment at Bourke Local Court in unrelated proceedings involving a different accused that a pair of scissors was not a knife within the meaning of the Summary Offences Act 1988. The prosecutor sought and was granted an adjournment so he could prepare legal submissions on the issue. 

3In the presence of the accused the matter was fixed for hearing on 31 January 2012 at Central Local Court part heard before me. The accused failed to appear at the hearing and the court determined pursuant to s 196 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that the hearing should proceed in the absence of the accused. Given that the Court Attendance Notice did not particularise the knife the matter proceeded under s 199 with the tender of the prosecution brief of evidence (Exhibit 1). 

4The evidence is that about 12.17pm on 7 December 2011 police made observations of the accused seated and smoking ""a bong"" in Ward Park, Devonshire Street, Surry Hills. Police approached the accused and could smell a strong odour of cannabis. Next to the accused was a plastic take away food container containing chopped cannabis. In front of the accused was a dark blue sports bag and sitting on top of the dark blue sports bag was a pair of brown handled metal bladed scissors. Exhibit 1 contains a photograph of the scissors.

(3) If an employee contravenes subsection (1), the employer is taken to have contravened that subsection, whether or not the employee contravened the provision without the employer's authority or contrary to the employer's orders or instructions.
(4) It is a defence to a prosecution against an employer for such a contravention if it is proved: 
(a) that the employer had no knowledge of the contravention, and
(b) that the employer could not, by the exercise of due diligence, have prevented the contravention.
(5) An employer may be proceeded against and convicted under subsection (1) by virtue of subsection (3) whether or not the employee has been proceeded against or convicted under subsection (1).
(6) The regulations may provide that this section does not apply to or in relation to any specified class or description of knife.""
6Section 3 defines a knife as follows:
knife includes: 
(a) a knife blade, or
(b) a razor blade, or
(c) any other blade,
but does not include anything that is of a class or description declared by the regulations to be excluded from this definition.

7Clause 11 of the Summary Offences Regulation 2010 relevantly provides:
11 Exempt knives
For the purposes of section 11F (6) of the Act, section 11F of the Act does not apply to: 
(a) plastic knives that are designed for eating purposes, or
(b) any blades (other than knife blades or a blade forming part of a machete, cleaver or sword).

Relevant principles of statutory construction 
8The court is required to prefer a construction which promotes the purpose or object of the Act to one that would not advance its purpose or object: Interpretation Act 1987, s33; DPP v Starr [2012] NSWSC 315 at [20] a decision concerning the analogous issue whether a ""knuckle duster"" was a prohibited weapon under the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998.

9The Act does not contain a statement of its objects and purposes and the Long Title is in neutral terms providing: ""An Act with respect to conduct in public and other places; to repeal the Offences in Public Places Act 1979, the Public Assemblies Act 1979 and the Prostitution Act 1979; and for other purposes"".

10In Kelly v The Queen [2004] HCA 12; 218 CLR 216 Justice McHugh in a dissenting judgment said of the modern approach to the statutory construction of the function of definitions in legislative instruments at [98] and [103] (footnotes omitted):

98. Purposive construction is the modern approach to statutory construction. Legislative enactments should be construed so as to give effect to their purpose even if on occasions this may require a ""strained construction"" to be placed on the legislation. The literal meaning of the legislative text is the beginning, not the end, of the search for the intention of the legislature. As Learned Hand J famously pointed out: 
""Of course it is true that the words used, even in their literal sense, are the primary, and ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of any writing: be it a statute, a contract, or anything else. But it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.""
... 
103. As I earlier pointed out, the function of a definition is not to enact substantive law. It is to provide aid in construing the statute. Nothing is more likely to defeat the intention of the legislature than to give a definition a narrow, literal meaning and then use that meaning to negate the evident policy or purpose of a substantive enactment. There is, of course, always a question whether the definition is expressly or impliedly excluded. But once it is clear that the definition applies, the better - I think the only proper - course is to read the words of the definition into the substantive enactment and then construe the substantive enactment - in its extended or confined sense - in its context and bearing in mind its purpose and the mischief that it was designed to overcome. To construe the definition before its text has been inserted into the fabric of the substantive enactment invites error as to the meaning of the substantive enactment.

11In Commissioner of Police v Kennedy [2007] NSWCA 328, Basten JA (with Hislop J agreeing) said following on from McHugh J's observations at [44]:

44 A number of comments may be made about this approach. First, it is said to follow the approach of McHugh J in Kelly v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 216 at [103] that ""once it is clear that the definition applies, the better - I think the only proper - course is to read the words of the definition into the substantive enactment"". That may be so, but as his Honour continued, it is then necessary to construe the substantive enactment ""in its context and bearing in mind its purpose and the mischief that it was designed to overcome"". No doubt, as suggested by Pearce and Geddes, it is an excellent test of good drafting to read a definition into an operative provision to see if it fits comfortably in the text: Statutory Interpretation in Australia (6th ed, LexisNexis, 2006) at [6.55]. However, if the definition as enacted does not fit comfortably into the text, the exercise of construction will need to address any logical or grammatical infelicities that arise.

The purpose and objects of the Act
12The Act does not contain a statutory statement as to its objects that would assist in its interpretation. Section 34(1)(b) of the Interpretation Act 1987 permits recourse to extrinsic material to determine the meaning of a provision if the provision is ""ambiguous or obscure"" (s 34(1)(b)(i)) or if its ordinary meaning ""leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable"" (s 34(1)(b)(ii)). However, s 34 does not permit the courts to ignore the language of the legislation and the intention of Parliament, apparent from Parliamentary Speeches, cannot be substituted for the precise terms of the Bill as enacted: R v Bolton; Ex parte Bean (1987) 162 CLR 514; Avel Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 11 NSWLR 126; R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112.

13The common law, independently of s 34, also permits a court to refer to extrinsic material in order to ascertain the mischief which a statute was intended to cure: CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; [1997] HCA 2; Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd (1997) 191 CLR 85 at 99, 112-3; [1997] HCA 53. 

Legislative history of the offence and the related offence of ""Custody of offensive implement"" - ss 11B and 11C

14In determining the meaning, object and purpose of the offence provision regarding custody of knives in a public place or school it is instructive to look at the legislative history of the offence and the related offence of custody of offensive implement in a public place or school. The following is materially relevant:

The Summary Offences Act 1970 did not contain a similar provision. Section 51 of the Act made it an offence, inter alia, to have custody of an offensive weapon with intent to commit and indictable offence which was in similar terms to s 114(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1990.
The Offences in Public Places (Further Amendment) Act 1987 No 131 inserted into the substantive Act s 11A, custody of offensive implement in public place.
The Summary Offences Act 1988 repealed the Offences in Public Places Act 1979. Section 10 of that Act provided for the offence of custody of offensive implement (since renumbered as s 1B).
The Summary Offences Amendment Act 1997 No 148 expanded the offence of custody of offensive implement to include a school and increased the penalty for s10 (now s11B). Importantly that Act also inserted the offences of s 10AA, wielding of knives in a public place (since renumbered as s 11E), and s 10AB, sale of knives and knife blades to children under 16 years of age (since renumbered as s 11F). Section 10AB used the words ""sells the knife or knife blade"". No definition was provided by that amendment as to what was a ""knife blade"".
The offence provision in question (s 11C) was inserted by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Police and Public Safety) Act 1998 No 38. That Act also inserted the definition of ""knife"" and amended s 11F by deleting the words ""or knife blade"". That act also inserted Part 5 Police Powers for public protection in public places and schools (since repealed) which inserted search and confiscation powers for ""dangerous implement"" (s 28) defined to include a knife, or a firearm (within the meaning of the Firearms Act 1996), a prohibited weapon or prohibited article (within the meaning of the Prohibited Weapons Act 1989) or an offensive implement within the meaning of s 11B (since repealed but relevant for present purposes).

Use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of the Act
15The word ""or any other blade"" in s 3 if given a literal meaning would lead to absurd and unreasonable results. A literal meaning would include a blade of grass, the blade of a cricket bat or an oar, rotor or propeller blades, the blade of a plough, the blade of a saw, shearing blades, the blades of secateurs, the blade of a paint scraper or the blade of a screwdriver to give as a number of examples. 

16The Explanatory note to the Summary Offences Amendment Bill 1997 is in neutral terms only making reference to a ""knife"" or ""knife blade"". The Second Reading Speeches (Agreed in Principle) by Ms Allan (Blacktown-Minister for the Environment) on behalf of Mr Whelan (Legislative Assembly, 26 November 1997) and the Hon J W Shaw (Attorney General, and Minister for Industrial Relations) (Legislative Council, 5 December 1997) both refer to the need for the increase in penalties and for the new provisions of ""Wielding a knife in a public place"" and ""Sale of knives to children"" because of ""an increase in knife-related violent crimes... involving a knife or dagger... this Government will not tolerate the existence of a knife culture."". Regarding the new offence of ""Wielding a knife in a public place"" both said, ""it will introduce an entirely new offence that applies to knives generally, rather than merely to knives or other implements that may be classified as offensive."" In the debates that ensued the focus was primarily upon the provision banning the sale of knives to children and issue was taken that there was no definition of a ""knife"" or for that matter ""knife blade."" That issue was resolved by making provision for a regulation making power (s 10AB(6) now s 11F(6) and reg 11) to exclude any specified class or description of knife or knife blade. It is instructive to note that the new offences of s 10AA, wielding of knives in a public place (since renumbered as s 11E) and s 10AB, sale of knives and knife blades (since renumbered as s 11F) were specifically limited to a class being knives or knife blades. It could hardly be said that a pair of scissors would have fallen within the expression knife blade given the qualification to the word blade by ""knife"" and ordinarily a pair of scissors would not be regarded as a knife. To the ordinary citizen who walks into a shop and asks to buy a knife it would defy common sense that they would be given a pair of scissors and the converse applies.

17The Explanatory note to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Police and Public Safety) Bill 1998 is again in neutral terms only making a reference to ""a knife"". The Second Reading Speeches (Agreed in Principle) by Mr Whelan, Minister for Police (Legislative Assembly 28 April 1998) and by the Hon J W Shaw (Attorney General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (Legislative Council, 5 May 1998) again both make reference for the need to protect the community from the increase in knife related crime. The debate that ensued and now somewhat more heated was a continuation of the law and order policy issues before the Parliament in the 1997 Bill about the need for increased penalties and provisions to fight knife related crime and tackle gang culture in addition to the then standing provisions in the Act prohibiting the custody of offensive implements, wielding knives in public places and the sale of knives to children. There was no debate as to what the words ""any other blade"" meant which was inserted as part of the definition of a knife. 

18However, both Ministers in their Second Reading Speeches regarding the new provisions concerning the confiscation of ""dangerous implements"" said ""By including ""offensive implements"", a term already defined in the Act, the reach of this provision will extend to items such as sharpened screwdrivers and blood- filled syringes."" (Legislative Assembly page 3970; Legislative Council page 4276). Ordinarily, a screwdriver does have a blade (see R v Davis [1998] Crim L. R. 564 CA at [18]) and on a literal reading would fit into the definition ""any other blade"", but that was not intended by both Ministers.

19During the very lengthy debates for the 1997 and 1998 Bills, particularly the latter, extensive references were made to the word knife or knives per se as well as to a variety of knives. References were made to the following knives: dagger, knife blade, flick knives, sheath knives, push daggers, butterfly knives, star knives, Demtel steak knives, butchers knife, carving knife, Swiss Army knives, plastic knives, kitchen knives, bread-and-butter knife, fishing knife, Stanley knife, surgical blades, cake knife, small knife, large knife, Bowie knife, pen knives, pocket knife, fold-up knife, Crocodile Dundee knives, hunting knife, Leatherman (with a saw and knife), catering knives, bartenders knife, machete, stiletto and small belt knife. There were only two references to scissors in the context of being in a Swiss Army pocket knife along with a small screwdriver, corkscrews and even toothpicks but not in the context of being a knife (Legislative Council 5 May 1998, p 4330 and 6 May 1998, p 4413). 

20It is apparent from the legislative history of the relevant provisions in Part 2 Division 2 of the Act and the extrinsic material that the mischief sought to be remedied was the increase in knife related crimes and the need for public safety. However, within the context of the Act as a whole a distinction was maintained between a knife and an offensive implement. While custody of a knife in a public place or school prohibited custody simpliciter the related offence of custody of an offensive implement requires an intended offensive purpose of causing injury or menace to a person or damage property in addition to its custody. During the debates reference was made to a number of other provisions, which deal with more serious offences involving the use of weapons or offensive implements such as armed robbery or the Weapons Prohibition Act. To suggest the test should be whether the scissors could be used to injure a person is not to focus on the meaning to be attributed to the word knife given the related offence under s 11B, otherwise s 11B would be otiose. Further, why limit the provision to knives and blades given that there is any number or other weapons or instruments, which could be used to injure persons. Both Ministers in their Second Reading Speeches after making reference to the existing offensive implement provision said: 
However, existing law does not necessarily make it an offence to be somewhere like George Street on a Saturday night with a large knife in one's pocket. It depends on the type of knife or the ability of the police to prove some intent to use it. By introducing the measures in this bill the Government is taking tough decisions. It is making a fundamental change in the law so it will no longer be lawful for any person to go into a public place with a knife-any knife-unless that person has a lawful excuse. (Court's emphasis) 
(Mr Whelan, Legislative Assembly 28 April 1998 at p 3969; see also the Hon J W Shaw (Attorney General, and Minister for Industrial Relations), Legislative Council, 5 May 1998 at p 4275 in almost similar words)

On 29 April 1998 Mr Whelan in reply to the earlier debates said (at pp 4160-61):
The new offence of possession of a knife in a public or school is a very wide provision and applies to any knife carried by any person in any public place. It will apply to bowie knives, carving knives and pen knives. It will apply to any knife carried without good cause in a public place in this State. If persons have more than an ordinary knife in their possession we will throw the book at them. If they have a prohibited weapon, such as a flick knife, in their possession they will face a penalty of up to 14 years in gaol... (Court's emphasis)

Given that the 1998 amendment included the definition provision of ""knife"" in question why the need to refer a ""a knife- any knife... It will apply to bowie knives, carving knives and pen knives... more than an ordinary knife..."" The context of both Ministers speeches indicates that they were intending to refer to what are intrinsically knives or fall within the broad category of a knife, for example a sword, machete or a meat cleaver (see also reg 11). However, as indicated earlier the courts cannot ignore the language of the legislation and the intention of Parliament, apparent from Parliamentary Speeches, cannot be substituted for the precise terms of the Bill as enacted. 

21The prosecutor in his written submissions has referred to the Second Reading Speech and Parliamentary debates for the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Possession of Knives in Public) Act 2009 No 80 which contain a number or references to scissors (screwdrivers are also referred to) being used in knife-related crime. The purpose of that Bill was to increase the penalty for an offence under s 11C where the offence is a second or subsequent offence (where the offence was under ss 11B-11C or any other offence punishable upon conviction by imprisonment for 2 years or more). The difficulty with that submission is twofold. Firstly, that extrinsic material relates only to an increase in penalty and not to creation of the offence and associated definition of knife and as such recourse to that extrinsic material is not permissible as it does not fall within the permissible categories in s 34(2)(e), (f) or (g), Interpretation Act 1987. Second, the increase in penalty also picked up prior offences under s 11B regarding offensive implements and the reference to scissors and screwdrivers (in addition to knife and sword) was in the context of the broad range of offences such as robberies. The prosecutor submits that a pair of scissors has all the characteristics of a knife and able to be used as a weapon (concealable; bladed; capable of inflicting catastrophic injury; and easily obtained) and therefore their inclusion in the definition advances the purpose of the mischief to be remedied.

22A similar issue was dealt with by the United Kingdom Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in R v Davis [1998] Crim L. R. 564 CA. The trial judge had held that a screwdriver was a bladed article within the meaning of s 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Section 139(2) provided that ""this section applies to any article which has a blade or is sharply pointed except a folding knife."" In holding that a screwdriver was not a bladed article the court said:
The article in question was a screwdriver. We have not seen it, but we are assured that it is correctly described in the ruling of the learned judge, which is to be found at page 4B of volume two of the transcripts before us. The judge said:
""It is common ground that this screwdriver is not sharply pointed, indeed no normal screwdriver would be suitable for its usual function, if it were.

However, in normal language and without straining the use of language, a standard screwdriver, has one or more blades usually angled and in positioned on each side of the driving head, which constitute a narrow and flattened ridge at the tip of the blade or blades. As such it is capable of causing injury to a third party if used offensively.

In my judgment any screwdriver and in particular the screwdriver which has been produced to me in this case, does constitute a bladed article to which section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act, as amended, applies."" 
So the judge's ruling was that the screwdriver, because it had what he described as ""blades positioned on each side of the driving head"" was a bladed article for the purpose of section 139.
...
However, in our judgement this is not a question of the interpretation of an ordinary English word in the terms adopted in the judgment of Lord Reid in the case of Brutus v. Cozens. It falls rather within the second category there recognised by Lord Reid, that is to say the construction of the terms of the statute. It necessarily follows that this must be a question of construction, in the terms in which the argument has been developed before us, because the issue here is not the simple etymological meaning of the word ""blade"", but whether this article, it being accepted at least for the purposes of this argument that it does have a blade, is the type of article with a blade that is intended to fall within the terms of section 139(2). That is a question of the construction of section 139, not a question of the meaning of the word ""blade"". To that extent, therefore, the judge was right in taking this burden upon himself.
We are, however, quite unable to agree with the conclusion to which he came. Firstly, we take up the argument advanced by Miss Deacon which also, so far as we can see, lies behind the judge's ruling. It is too simple to say that the mischief of this section is to deter the carrying of items that could cause injury. Preventing or deterring further offences in which injuries are caused is, we entirely accept, no doubt the longterm and perfectly understandable objective of Parliament in passing sections such as section 139. Such an objective was also behind the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 which, however, limited itself to objects made or intended for the purpose of causing injury. The contention here goes much wider: that any object that could be so used potentially falls within the section.
The objections to that are twofold. Firstly, it gives the section an extremely wide ambit. As soon as an object falls within this section and a citizen is found with it in his possession in public, he has to prove that he has a good excuse for having it. That is a very significant limitation on the citizen's freedom. It should not be assumed that it has been achieved except by the use of clear words.
Second, the degree to which Parliament thought it proper to interfere with the citizen's freedom in that way is demonstrated by the limitation in the section to articles, in section 139(2), which have a blade or are sharply pointed, except folding pocketknives. The common sense assumption that lies behind that section is that Parliament sought to prevent or deter the carrying of what might be broadly called sharp instruments in public, not any article that has a blade even if a screwdriver can be so described but an article with a blade that falls within the same broad category as a knife or a sharply pointed instrument. That follows not only as a matter of common sense, but by looking at the specific items that are mentioned in the section, that is to say sharply pointed instruments or folding pocketknives, and inferring from that what the nature of the bladed article is to which Parliament was referring.
It seems to us, in that comparison, that it would be quite unlikely, indeed in our view impossible, that Parliament intended an article such as a screwdriver, just because it has a blade, to fall into the same category as a sharply pointed item or a folding pocketknife.
Further, that that is the construction of the phrase ""any article which has a blade"" is strongly reinforced by referring to section 139(3), which we have already read. The section applies to a folding pocketknife if the cutting edge of its blade exceeds three inches. That section, in its very language, seems to assume that references to blades entail references to a cutting edge. That is how the expression is used in section 139(3). It is also, as we have said, the way in which the other items in section 139(2) seem to be described.
In our judgement, the test cannot be, as the judge suggested, whether the article is capable of causing injury. If that were the test there would be no need and no justification to do what Parliament has specifically done, and limit the section to bladed items and sharp instruments. If the objective was to outlaw the carrying of all items capable of causing injury there would be no explanation at all for why there was a limitation to articles which happen to have something that could be described as a blade.
For all those reasons, which at the end of the day come down to a matter of common sense, we consider that the judge's ruling on this matter was not correct and that therefore the conviction was incorrectly entered and should be quashed.""

23The words ""bladed article"" in s 139 and ""any other blade"" in s 3 are synonymous. It is trite to say that if a screwdriver is not a ""bladed article"" even more so would it not be ""any other blade"" for the purposes of s 11C if one follows the approach of the UK Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). Further, it was the obvious intention of both Ministers that a sharpened screwdriver was not a knife but an offensive implement. There is no logical distinction between a screwdriver and a pair of scissors for present purposes- both have blades and can be used to cause serious injury.

24As the UK Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) rightly pointed out, to say that a citizen has a defence of lawful excuse does not mean they cannot be arrested and then are required to raise the defence in court. That of itself is a significant intrusion into the liberty of a citizen and any legislative intent to be found in s11C to apply to a blade other than what falls within the broad category of a knife is not to be so widely read unless there is a clear intention to do so.

25The prosecutor also referred to a number of other UK decisions:

Brooker v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] EWHC 1132 (Admin) where the court held that a 10cm blade from a butter knife without a sharp edge, without a point and without a handle was a bladed article. There is no doubt that blade would be a knife within the ordinary sense of the word or for that matter a blade within the meaning or ss 3 and 11C of the Act.
R v Deegan [1998] EWCA Crim 385 which dealt with the exception in s139 (2) and (3) as to what is a ""folding pocketknife"". That decision has no material bearing for the purposes of ss 3 and 11C of the Act as a folding pocketknife would clearly fall within the meaning of a knife and there is no similar exception.
R v Qayum [2010] EWCA Crim 2237. The accused had pleaded guilty to possessing a bladed article, namely a pair of scissors and the decision mainly turns upon sentencing for the offence. By the plea of guilty no issue arose whether the pair of scissors was ""a blade or is sharply pointed"" article and the court did not indicate in any other way whether it was a blade or is sharply pointed. The UK provision is in dissimilar terms in that the primary focus is not on a knife per se. What is important is the approach in statutory construction in R v Davis of analogous legislation rather than on whether the weapon or instrument can cause physical injury.

Is a pair of scissors a ""blade"" within the meaning of s 3 of the Act?
26The Macquarie Dictionary for present purposes defines a knife, blade and scissors as follows:
""knife...1.a cutting instrument consisting essentially of a thin blade (usually of steel and with a sharp edge) attached to a handle. 2. a knifelike weapon; a dagger; a short sword. 3.any blade for cutting, as in a tool or machine.""
""blade... 1. the flat cutting part of a sword, knife, etc. 2. a sword.3 (plural) handheld shears for shearing sheep.""
""scissors...plural noun 1. a cutting instrument consisting of two blades (with handles) sp pivoted together that their edges work against each other (often called a pair of scissors)"".

For present purposes it would not strain the ordinary use of the words ""or any other blade"" to include a pair of scissors notwithstanding what appears to have been the intention of Parliament to deal with what are intrinsically knives or fall within the broad category of a knife, for example a sword, machete or a meat cleaver. To say that a pair of scissors is a blade because they are a cutting instrument does not particularly assist because otherwise that would also include a saw, shearing blades, secateurs and paint scrapers to name a few other instruments with blades. Many of the variety of knives referred to in the debates would in common experience be possessed by gangs or be regarded as a status symbol within gangs or be part of knife culture (see for example the Hon Janelle Saffin, Legislative Council 5 May 1998, p 4332). It would defy common sense to suggest a pair of scissors, a screwdriver, saw, secateurs, shearing blades or paint scraper as examples to be items of knife culture. Either is it likely that it was the intention of Parliament to apply because scissors have a blade since that would then also include a screwdriver (along with the other blades just referred to) and the intention seems otherwise given that both Second Reading Speeches for the 1998 Bill which inserted s 11C explicitly drew a distinction between a knife as a knife and a screwdriver as an offensive implement for the purposes of then s 28 (since repealed). 

27There is one further matter of significance in construing whether a pair of scissors is a knife within the defined meaning in s 3. Section 11C also applies to ""a school"". Ordinarily one would not expect a child to have custody of a knife (intrinsically a knife or which falls within the broad category of a knife) within in a school. During the debates an example of knife custody in a school was given for cutting up an apple. By itself that would be a very irregular event. However, one would expect that at least most children would have a pair of scissors in their custody at school for legitimate educational purposes. Often those scissors are quite small and all bar the blades made of plastic. It would defy common sense to say it was the intention of Parliament by prohibiting custody of scissors in a school that it would fight knife culture. Further, it is difficult to see that the Parliament intended that children who had custody of a pair of scissors in a school could lead to the arrest and detention of the child and leave it for them to explain a lawful excuse to a police officer or in court. As the UK Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) said in R v Davis:

... Firstly, it gives the section an extremely wide ambit. As soon as an object falls within this section and a citizen is found with it in his possession in public, he has to prove that he has a good excuse for having it. That is a very significant limitation on the citizen's freedom. It should not be assumed that it has been achieved except by the use of clear words.

Conclusion
28Upon a consideration of the Act as a whole and reference to the extrinsic Parliamentary material, particularly to the extensive reference to knives per se it is clear that the object of the legislation was to fight ""knife culture"" through prohibiting the custody of knives in public places and schools. The definition of ""knife"" in s 3 should be interpreted to refer to those items that are intrinsically knives or fall within the broad category of a knife. Whatever may be the full ambit of the definition needs to be considered on a case by case basis but by giving the definition the meaning attributed above the evident mischief of the Act is not curtailed or diminished. To adopt the words of the UK Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in R v Davis:
It seems to us, in that comparison, that it would be quite unlikely, indeed in our view impossible, that Parliament intended an article such as a screwdriver, just because it has a blade, to fall into the same category as a sharply pointed item or a folding pocketknife.
Those words are apposite to the custody of not only a screwdriver but also a pair of scissors under s 11C. For those reasons the court finds the offence not proven and the accused not guilty. The Court Attendance notice is dismissed.

2BLANCH J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on 25 August 2010 in the District Court. He was convicted by a jury after trial on a charge of wounding Christopher Evans with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s33(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and in respect of which there is a standard non-parole period of seven years.

3He was sentenced to nine years imprisonment from 29 June 2010 and a non-parole period of six years was specified.

4The only ground of appeal is that ""the judge erred in the approach taken to the standard non-parole period in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.""

5After the trial the judge made the following finding as to the relevant facts for the purpose of sentencing:

""His (the victim's) account essentially was that upon answering a knock at the door of his residence at 6/23 Pyrmont Bridge Road, Camperdown, on the date in question, 7 June 2009, a knock on the door to the person by the name of Andrew Touty, who he referred to as Andy. He said thereafter that the offender, who was known to him as Stretch, lunged forward, grabbed him by the throat and produced a knife, while saying words to the effect of ""Where's the marihuana?"" and thereafter stabbed him, Mr Evans. What happened was they both fell onto the bed where Evans pinned the offender whilst calling out for help. He pinned him for a number of minutes, the knife was attached to him, or inside him at that point and after a few minutes Evans weakened and the offender pushed him off and ran out. It was obvious from any observation of Evans and the evidence at the trial that he is a very large man, a man of some 150 kilograms, but he was clearly out of shape and unfit, and according to his evidence he had been recently released from hospital and did not have much reserve of energy.

The stab wound itself was to the left side and under the armpit and I will deal with that again later.

Andrew Touty was clearly an accomplice, to use that loose expression. He gave evidence for the Crown in the trial and his evidence was to the effect that the visit to the residence of the victim had been pre-planned with a view to obtaining marihuana. And according to Touty the accused remarked to him, before setting off, ""If anything happens I'll scare him with the knife"" and deposited a knife down his pants. Touty said that it was he who knocked at the door, which corresponds with the evidence of the victim and he also says when the door was opened the offender, who had been standing nearby, burst in and demanded the pot.

The offender was interviewed on 7 June 2009 and he told a series of blatant lies to the police. At one point he denied going to the unit and ultimately said he stood nearby. In addition he false implicated Touty as the actual stabber. In evidence at the trial the offender's evidence was to the effect that this was all Touty's idea and indeed the offender was unaware of the knife until Touty produced it outside the unit and it was then that the offender secreted the knife down his pants. On the offender's version thereafter he waited outside, heard arguing between Touty and the victim, and ultimately he approached closer to the unit and at that point Evans enquired when he was going to get eighty-five dollars that the offender was said to have owed him. And thereafter, on the offender's account, it was Evans who dragged the offender inside and tossed him around like a rag doll and punched him to the face. They finished up on the bed with Evans on top, on the offender's account, and the offender claimed he used the knife to get Evans off, in effect and gave him a little prick under the armpit.

It was clear that looking at the evidence in the trial that there was no objective evidence, in my view, that supported the account of the offender and indeed the suggestion that he had been struck by Evans repeatedly and vigorously, was not borne out by any objective evidence at all.

It was no surprise that the somewhat fanciful account of the offender was rejected by the jury, and, as I have said, I accept the evidence of the victim beyond reasonable doubt and I accept Touty's evidence that it was the offender who initiated the visit and the offender armed himself, in anticipation of a confrontation with the victim.

The wound itself did not require treatment by suturing, rather it was treated with glue; it was a two centimetre obliquely oriented wound, just higher than the nipple at the left armpit but it did track down to the ribs where it stopped. It went in about six or seven centimetres which I remarked is more by good luck than good management. It was on any view a significant wound and inflicted with a large and dangerous knife with a twenty centimetre blade. 

It is a fact this stabbing took place as a planned venture, designed to extract marijuana from the victim. It occurred in circumstances involving a violent invasion of the victim's home by a man armed with a large knife. On any view it is a serious example of offences of this type. The offender was intoxicated at the time of the offence. There is nothing in my view that diminishes the objective gravity of the offence.""

6The applicant asserts the judge erred by assessing the offence to be ""within the mid-range of objective gravity"" noting that ""the mid-range is said not to be any narrow band."" The judge said ""It seems to me that having found it is in the mid-range of objective seriousness the only reason to depart from the standard non-parole period would be a finding of special circumstances. I propose to find special circumstances.""

7The argument advanced by the applicant is that the judge departed from the standard non-parole period only to the limited extent necessary to give effect to the finding of special circumstances. It is pointed out that the sentencing occurred prior to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 and the law applied by the judge was according to the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168.

8In Muldrock v The Queen at [25] the Court said:

""The court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the midrange of objective seriousness.""

9To this extent then what the sentencing judge did in assessing sentence was not required of him although what he did was in accord with authority binding on him at the time. 

10On the other hand the sentencing judge was still required to have regard to the standard non-parole period as well as the maximum penalty when imposing sentence. In Muldrock (supra) at [27] the Court said:

""Section 54B(2) and (3) oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence. In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period.""

11The decision of the High Court in Muldrock (supra) does not mean that a sentencing judge should not assess the seriousness of the offence in the way judges have always done that - Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288, Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240. In a case where there is a standard non-parole period that includes by reference to a notional case where the seriousness of the offence is mid-range.

12The Crown concedes that the approach he adopted was not in accord with the current law. This Court must now make its own assessment of how the offending is to be properly characterised - Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 254 CLR 259.

13Even if the sentencing judge embarked on an unnecessary process in assessing sentence the question for this Court is whether the sentence imposed is inappropriate and whether a less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed in accordance with s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

14The offence itself was undoubtedly serious in that it was planned to take a knife to confront the victim. It is also clear there was a deliberate stabbing of the victim to his body in a position where considerable damage could have been done. On the other hand the wounding was not extensive and was dealt with by glue to close the wound. There is no suggestion of ongoing problems from the wound.

15The sentencing judge noted the antecedents of the applicant included an assault in 1983, a malicious wounding in 1992, an assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 1992, a possess shortened firearm in 1994 and a common assault in 2000. It was noted there was a significant gap between the common assault in 2000 and the commission of these offences in 2009. 

16It was noted he was adopted as an infant and raised by his adoptive parents. He rebelled at the age of 12 when he discovered he was adopted. He was diagnosed with ADHD and medicated. At the age of 14 he was evicted from the family home and lived in a halfway house. He was in a relationship between 1981 and 1998 and has four children aged 20, 17, 13 and 10. For three weeks prior to the offence he was living with friends because of an apprehended violence order taken out against him by a neighbour. He has been on a disability support pension since 1996. The Probation report indicates he has been a cannabis user since the age of 16 and he has also used heroin and amphetamines. His consumption of alcohol is described as problematic and contributed to the commission of this offence. The sentencing judge found he had guarded prospects of rehabilitation.

17Bearing in mind the objective and subjective factors as found by the judge and with due regard to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, in my view the appropriate course to take is to impose a sentence less than that imposed in the first instance, maintaining a finding of special circumstances. 

18I propose the following orders:

(1)Grant leave to appeal.

(2)Allow the appeal and quash the sentence and non-parole period imposed in the District Court.

(3)Impose a sentence of a non-parole period of four years and six months to date from 29 June 2010 to expire 28 December 2014 with a balance of term of two years and six months. 

19HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Blanch J and for the reasons stated by his Honour.

2759185,R v Jarrett [2012] NSWCCA 81,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: I agree with Blanch J. 

2BLANCH J: The Crown appeals pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a decision of his Honour Judge Black in the District Court at Lismore on 31 October 2011.

3The respondent appeared for trial on an indictment alleging that between 29 June 2007 and 1 July 2007 he committed two offences of indecent assault contrary to s61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 and two offences of sexual intercourse with a child under 16 contrary to s61J Crimes Act 1900.

4The Crown case was that the complainant, a 12 year old girl, stayed over at the home of her friend who was the daughter of the respondent. She said that her friend went to bed and the respondent then indecently assaulted her and then had penile vaginal intercourse with her. There was some evidence of complaint to a girlfriend in 2007 and also to a boyfriend. The complainant was not interviewed by police until 29 January 2009.

5At trial the Crown sought to lead evidence of admissions made by the respondent to hospital staff and to Mr Greg Telford, an employee of the Department of Community Services, after he presented himself to the Emergency Department of Lismore Base Hospital.

6The first piece of evidence sought to be led was a statement from Dr Petroff, a consultant psychiatrist who identified a form filled in by him on 2 October 2007. That form noted a confession by the respondent that he "",... sexually abused his daughter's 13 year old friend some months ago..."" and noted the girl had abused him and he was terrified of going to gaol and was threatening to kill himself if discharged. The doctor ticked a box saying the respondent ""is a mentally disordered person"" and directed he be kept in casualty and treated.

7The second piece of evidence was a statement from Denis Casey, a clinical nurse at the hospital and he identified the medical notes he made relating to the respondent and said they accurately reflected what the respondent said to him. Those notes reveal the respondent was lying in bed sobbing and said he had ""interfered with a 13 year old girl."" The girl rang him and said she ""had had enough."" He was terrified she would tell someone and he would ""lose his kids and go to jail."" The nurse noted he was not mentally ill but acutely stressed.

8The third statement was from Dr Chris Donatsch who was the psychiatric registrar at the hospital at the relevant time. He identified hospital notes he made at the time and said they were true. Those notes begin ""Self presented to E Dept with suicidal ideation. Claims he had a sexual relationship with a 13 y.o. girl 2 months ago. Feels remorseful, terrified of consequences ..."".

9The fourth statement was from Greg Telford who was an employee of the Department of Community Services in 2007. He said that between 2 October and 10 October 2007 he was asked by the hospital to come and talk to the respondent. He went to the hospital and told the respondent:

""I know what you're here for. I have to tell you straight up that prior to talking to me, that should you mention the young girl's name, I am a mandatory reporter and I will have to notify the authorities.""

10The following exchange occurred between the witness and the respondent:

Respondent: ""Yeah that's ok"".
Witness: ""Is it true that you had sex with the young girl?""
Respondent: ""Yeah and I've got to admit I wasn't the first.""
Witness: ""Regardless she is still a minor.""
Respondent: ""I want to take responsibility for my behaviour.""

11After objection was taken to the admission of the evidence the trial judge refused to admit the evidence from these four witnesses because it would be unfair within the meaning of that term in s90 of the Evidence Act 1995. He gave as the reason for doing this that at the time the admissions were made Dr Petroff had diagnosed the respondent as mentally disordered and quoted the definition in s15 of the Mental Health Act 2007 as follows:

""A person, whether or not the person is suffering from mental illness, is a mentally disordered person if the person's behaviour for the time being, is so irrational as to justify a conclusion on reasonable grounds that temporary care, treatment or control of the person is necessary (a) for the person's own protection from serious physical harm; or (b) for the protection of others from serious physical harm.""

12The trial judge also noted that to admit the evidence might prolong any trial because of arguments as to how reliable the confessions were.

13Because this is a Crown appeal pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Crown must first establish that the rejection of the evidence ""...eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case."" Here the case against the respondent in the absence of the confessions was the evidence of the complainant and some evidence of complaint. The evidence of the confessions was undoubtedly the strongest part of the Crown case and the rejection of that evidence did substantially weaken the Crown case. In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWLR 228 at [37] Spigelman CJ said:

""Even a case which is otherwise likely, even very likely, to succeed, may still be 'substantially weakened' if evidence of cogency or force is withheld.""

14Here the Crown case in the absence of the admissions may or may not succeed and the Crown is entitled to challenge the rejection of the evidence. 

15The rejection of the evidence by the trial judge was based on s90 of the Evidence Act 1995 which allows the rejection of evidence. Section 90(b) states ""having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence."" In Em v The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 67; [2007] HCA 46 Gummow and Hayne JJ noted that while the section requires that regard be had to the circumstances in which the admissions were made, it is the use of the evidence at the trial which is to be characterised as ""unfair"": at [107].

16Although the trial judge did not refer in his reasons for rejecting the evidence to the case of R v Medcalfe [2002] ACTSC 83 it was a case submitted to the judge as relevant because of the exercise of the power to reject confession evidence under s90 based on the mental state of the accused. That was a completely different case because the accused had earlier been found unfit to plead and there was psychiatric material detailing his mental condition. It was also a case where the confession was as a result of police questioning and the judge in the ACT Supreme Court formed the view as a result of the medical evidence the accused did not understand the caution and was giving answers he thought would please.

17In this case there was no evidence of the mental state of the respondent at the time of the admissions. A bare assertion that he was mentally disordered was not sufficient to conclude it would be unfair to admit the evidence. The doctor was not called to give evidence and it is plain from the hospital notes that the only basis for concluding the respondent was mentally disordered was his concern he might go to gaol as a result of committing the offences and was threatening to commit suicide.

18The onus of establishing unfairness under s90 lies on an accused as it did at common law, see Em v The Queen supra at [63]. Here that onus was not discharged. The admissions made were apparently spontaneous and the consideration that their admission might prolong a trial because of arguments about reliability was an irrelevant consideration.

19I propose:

(1)The Crown appeal be allowed.

(2)The order rejecting the confessions be set aside.

(3)The case be remitted to the District Court at Lismore for trial.

20HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Blanch J.

		16 August 2013",2012-05-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759189,R v Joshua Veitch [2012] NSWDC 174,"Judgment 
Introduction

1HIS HONOUR: The learned Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales proposes to have the accused, Joshua Veitch, arraigned on three charges set out in the indictment filed yesterday dated 7 May 2012. The three allegations are: firstly, that the accused on 18 May 2011 at Leichhardt in the State of New South Wales did assault KS thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to her. The second count in the indictment alleges that on 18 May 2011 at Leichhardt in the State of New South Wales he did have sexual intercourse with KS without her consent, knowing she not consenting thereto, in circumstances of aggravation; in that he, the said Joshua Veitch, did immediately before the offence intentionally or recklessly inflict actual bodily harm upon her. In the alternative to count 2 the Crown pleads that the accused on 18 May 2011 at Leichhardt in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with KS, without her consent, knowing she was not consenting thereto.

2Before the empanelment of the jury a number of issues were raised relating to the issue of a subpoena by the legal representatives of the accused which required determination of the Court before the trial could proceed. The ""complainant"" identified in the indictment and to whom I will refer to as the complainant throughout these reasons, is legally represented in relation to these matters. In relation to the conduct of the proceedings, although within the terms of ss 295 to 306 Criminal Procedure Act (""CPA"") 1986 there are particular provisions in relation to ""Notice"" and the like, no issue is taken in relation to those matters.

3The issues that I was required to consider in a general summary were firstly, an application by the complainant to set aside the subpoena issued on behalf of the accused; secondly, an issue raised by learned counsel for the accused as to whether the material contained within the subpoenaed material was covered by the sexual assault communications privilege as (a) ""protected confidence""; thirdly, I had to determine, assuming that I rejected the previous applications, whether I should grant leave under the division for access to be granted to some or all of the documents that have been produced under subpoena in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 6 Pt 5 Div 2 CPA and particularly s 299D.

4The subpoena to produce was issued, as I would understand it, on 30 March 2012, returnable on 19 April 2012 to the Proper Officer, Health Information and Records Service for the Western Sydney Mental Health District, (Deleted Hospital). The documents produced to the Court in MFI 1 and the subject of the various applications are produced by the New South Wales Western Sydney Local Health District. On my examination of them they purport to be in their totality records of the Cumberland Hospital and officers of that hospital, administrative, medical and nursing. The subpoena sought:

Setting aside the subpoena

5Counsel for the complainant sought to set aside the subpoena on the general bases that it was a subpoena that served ""no legitimate forensic purpose"", was unacceptably wide and was in its form and its purpose tantamount to a ""fishing expedition"" on behalf of the accused, to summarise the points that she raised. I declined yesterday to set aside the subpoena save for restricting the period covered by the subpoena from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2007. Putting aside all the myriad of reasons for doing that as a matter of law and on the evidence available to me, the significance of the date 1 January 2000 concerns itself with some history given by the complainant, which is in the public domain, of a head injury occurring approximately ten years before the events giving rise to the charges in the indictment, which of course was 18 May 2011.

6I concluded that this subpoena was ""no fishing expedition"". I should, in summary, explain both for the purposes of justifying that finding and to put in context other aspects of this matter, some of the material upon which I rely. 

7I have a statement of the complainant dated 24 May 2011, which, I am informed, sets out the allegations against the accused and sets out the context in which those allegations arise. As I understand the statement, and I stand to be corrected, the particular allegations giving rise to the charges may be found between paras 13 and 20 of the statement. There may be some material in adjoining paragraphs which is also directly relevant to the events of 18 May, but essentially the allegations are contained in those paragraphs.

8In the context of providing information about her background and in the context of explaining the association with the accused who was known to her and with whom she had had a relationship over some period of time before the relevant events, the complainant volunteered to the police at para 5:

[Deleted in accordance with non publication order]

9In the document under the heading ""Patient Medical History"" (Exhibit D) relating to the complainant which I understand is produced from the Crown brief, the patient medical history provided on about 19 May 2011 refers to the alleged assault brought against the accused and references to a sexual assault. It also states this:

[Deleted in accordance with non publication order]

10A urine sample apparently was taken from the complainant in relation to the police investigation of this matter. Exhibit G, a certificate of analysis, shows screening tests provided no detected presence of amphetamines, opiates, cannabinoids, methadone, cocaine or barbiturates, but found detected benzodiazepines. It specifically identifies Nordiazepam, Oxazepam and Temazepam as detected. Two other medications, Doxylamine and Venlafaxine were also detected. The Crown has volunteered from the Bar table that one of those medications is an antihistamine, the other is an antidepressant. I am also informed from the Bar table so far as it goes that the benzodiazepines that have been detected are in effect a variance of the same type of medication.

11The complainant in her statement to the police informed the police, particularly at para 21, that after the events that give rise to the allegations with which I am concerned, she contacted a ""close friend"" of hers called DF. She said that she went to the Leichhardt Medical Centre and saw a Dr AG with a person called DP and gave some details of the medical treatment she received and her understanding of the results of that medical treatment.

12As a consequence no doubt of the information volunteered by the complainant, the police interviewed DF and he gave a statement on 11 June 2011. 

13He said at para 4 of the statement:

[Deleted in accordance with non publication order]

14Later on in his statement he gives details of representations he says were made to her by the complainant that may in the criminal trial be available for a hearsay evidence purpose, pursuant to s 66 Evidence Act 1995, setting out details of the allegations the complainant made about the conduct of the accused. The complainant, in the course of explaining what happened, told Mr F that she was ""extremely scared and frightened"". Mr F in his statement had volunteered, ""(When KS is in that state she just shuts down)"".

15Mr P was a person who came to know the complainant as a friend of the accused, as I understand his statement. He knew the accused approximately two years before the relevant events, having met the accused when he was participating in a drug rehabilitation program. According to his statement, he first met the complainant in February 2011 through the accused, in circumstances where he understood the complainant was the accused's girlfriend at that time. He said in his statement, at para 6, that he often talked with the complainant and stated:

[Deleted in accordance with non publication order]

16There was other information, of course, within the statement, including what one might have thought was the essential purpose of obtaining the statement, that is, the details of representations that Mr P claims were made to him by the complainant shortly after the events giving rise to the charges. 

17I should point out in passing, as I was proposing to do when I referred to the charges in the indictment, that as the matter unfolded, although counsel for the accused was rather coy about volunteering information that might assist me to understand what the issues were in the trial, I understand for the purposes of this decision that issues for determination at the trial will include issues of consent in the general sense. I was not aided by any greater specificity in relation to that matter. Also, matters concerning the circumstances and/or manner in which the complainant was injured, if injured at all, by the accused will be raised.

18In the course of the submissions that were put in relation to the issue of setting aside the subpoena, I was not assisted by any particular authorities. There was little discussion on legal issues in relation to this matter, beyond referring to time honoured phrases that have found their way through the authorities. I have had regard overnight to seminal authorities such as the Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564, particularly at pp 573 to 575, R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14, particularly at pp 16 to 18, and to a limited extent, bearing in mind it was concerned in its terms with important issues of public interest immunity and the like, Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404.

19In the context of the material in the public domain and the issues arising, as I understand them, given particularly information volunteered by the complainant and contemporary records of medical history provided by the complainant, and, of course, noting representations the complainant had made to third parties, there can be no doubt that, for the purposes of the issue of the subpoena, it was ""on the cards"" that material that potentially was relevant to the proceedings, or would be relevant to proceedings, particularly in relation to the medical condition or mental state of the complainant, would arise from the subpoenaed material.

20The records of the (Deleted) Hospital, subpoenaed by the accused, could and would, in their terms, relate to the capacity of the complainant for rational or irrational conduct at particular times, her capacity in certain circumstances to be deluded or to hallucinate, and also to provide information about medications used by the complainant and their reaction upon her, amongst other salient matters. I do not think there is a need, in the context of the way the matter was argued before me, to dilate upon the reasoning of Hunt J, for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Saleam, but I particularly note pp 17A and 17G through to 18D and 18F and G. There are some other remarks at p 19 of that judgment that are apposite to the consideration that I have taken of the matter. In any event, it was clear to my mind that the application to set aside the subpoena should fail. 

Protected confidence or not?

21The next issue that arose was an application to exclude consideration of the terms of Chapter 6 Pt 5, Div 2 of the CPA. This Division contains ss 296 to 306. The basis of the application was that the material produced under subpoena could not be regarded as a ""protected confidence"". I am mindful, for the purposes of this application, the difficulties that counsel had, both for the complainant and the accused, and to some extent the Crown, although the Crown has really been a bystander to relevant events, given the lack of access to the material. On the other hand, of course the complainant, as I would have understood it, would have been entitled to write an authority to have the material provided to her, or to her legal representatives.

22In summary, the argument put to the Court was that the information anticipated within the subpoenaed material was not a ""protected confidence"", having regard to the character of the condition that was treated, the treatment that was expected to be given, the period of time over which the relevant treatment would have been provided, that is, up until 2007, and the fact, as a contextual matter, that the material sought was in relation to the medical conditions of the complainant absent claims of sexual assault. With regard to the issue of what is a protected confidence under the CPA, the interpretation provision refers to definitions for the principal protected confider, who in this case is the complainant, the relevant definition of sexual assault, which obviously applies in this particular matter, and the character of a document recording a protected confidence.

23Section 296 provides - 

""(1) In this Division: 

""protected confidence"" means a counselling communication that is made by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence. 

(2) A counselling communication is a protected confidence for the purposes of this Division even if it: 

(a) was made before the acts constituting the relevant sexual assault offence occurred or are alleged to have occurred, or 

(b) was not made in connection with a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence or any condition arising from a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence. 

(3) For the purposes of this section, a communication may be made in confidence even if it is made in the presence of a third party if the third party is present to facilitate communication or to otherwise further the counselling process. 

(4) In this section: 

""counselling communication"" means a communication: 

(a) made in confidence by a person (the ""counselled person"") to another person (the ""counsellor"") who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered, or 

(b) made in confidence to or about the counselled person by the counsellor in the course of that counselling, or 

(c) made in confidence about the counselled person by a counsellor or a parent, carer or other supportive person who is present to facilitate communication between the counselled person and the counsellor or to otherwise further the counselling process, or 

(d) made in confidence by or to the counsellor, by or to another counsellor or by or to a person who is counselling, or has at any time counselled, the person. 

(5) For the purposes of this section, a person ""counsels"" another person if: 

(a) the person has undertaken training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm, and 

(b) the person: 

(i) listens to and gives verbal or other support or encouragement to the other person, or 

(ii) advises, gives therapy to or treats the other person, 

whether or not for fee or reward"". 

24It is also worth noting s 298 of the Act, which states that except with the leave of the Court a person cannot compel, whether by subpoena or any other procedure, any other person to produce a document recording a protected confidence in connection with any criminal proceedings and of course, leave is required to produce such a document, to provide access, and in due course, if relevant to the issues in the trial, permit evidence to be adduced which may disclose such a protected confidence. In relation to this matter it goes without saying, as s 299A makes clear, that the complainant is a party to these applications and may protect her interests to prevent the production of documents or access to documents as the case may be.

25I also note the terms of s 299B, which is, according to the publishers of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in the ""Butterworth's Practice"", appears under the heading, ""Determining if there is a protected confidence"". It notes that the Court may consider the relevant document or evidence that is claimed to be the subject of the Act, and particularly a claim that it is a protected confidence. 

26It states:

""A Court must not make available or disclose to a party, other than a protected confider, any document or evidence to which this section applies (or the contents of any such document) unless:

(a) the Court determines that the document does not record a protected confidence or that the evidence would not disclose a protected confidence; or

(b) a party has been given leave under this division in relation to the document or evidence and making available or disclosing the document or evidence is consistent with that leave.""

27Section 299B(4) states that:

""A Court may make any orders if it thinks fit to facilitate its consideration of a document or evidence under this section.""

28I did not provide the documents to the parties for consideration of the issue of whether in fact there was a protected confidence or confidences contained within the documents subpoenaed. 

29As I indicated yesterday, having regard to the subpoenaed material, despite the fact that some documents would appear to be of a purely administrative matter and may, prima facie, not be a ""protected confidence"" (serving the purpose of delineating relevant medical and nursing notes, serving, in other words, a filing or administrative purpose or providing an administrative context for the documents which contained a protected confidence) the subpoenaed documents were relevantly covered by Pt 5, Div 2.

30In relation to the documents that are produced, I note that all the records were records made, as I understand the dates of the documents, at least five and a half to six years or more, before the acts giving rise to the charges to proffer in the indictment. All the records that were produced under subpoena were not made in connection with the particular sexual assault matters and/or are directly related to the charges with which I am concerned. The documents produced, however, included communications that were made in confidence by the ""counselled person""; to wit, the complainant (as defined) to a ""counsellor"".

31I am satisfied that each of the documents were made in confidence by a counsellor or recorded information provided by the counselled person to the counsellor in confidence. I am satisfied that all the relevant documents would otherwise have satisfied the terms of s 296(4). The terms of the entries reflect records made by a person who has undertaken, on the face of the material, training, study or experience; and it is clear from the recording that the records relate to information that arose from a person, so qualified, listening to and giving support or encouragement to the counselled person or advising or treating her. These are the matters of which I must be satisfied, under s 296, to determine that the material is a protected confidence.

32In light of these findings there is no need to analyse the construction of s 296 any further. It might be said that the terms of the section are very wide and go beyond what might, in literal way, be thought to be ""sexual assault counselling notes or confidences"". However the terms of the provision are to be applied, giving the words their ordinary meaning in the legislative context in which they appear. The submissions of counsel for the accused are devoid of any reference to authority to support particular interpretations advanced and leave me to no alternative other than to consider the provision as encompassing the material contained within the subpoenaed documents, bearing in mind the context earlier referred to of the legitimate forensic purpose and the terms of s 299D dealing with the separate issue of the circumstances in which leave may be granted to gain access and/or adduce evidence of the contents of the documents. 

Consideration of a grant of leave pursuant to s 299D

33This leaves, then, consideration of the terms of s 299D of the Act, in the context of the other provisions which inform consideration of it. In that regard, in the course of discussion I note the matters raised by learned counsel for the complainant in relation to ss 302 and 306. I am satisfied, in the circumstances of the matter, to rely upon the outcome of the discussion I had with learned counsel and the approach she took to those provisions in light of our discussions settling those issues. In any event, they do not require any further determination by me at this time given that discussion yesterday.

34s 299D CPA provides: 

""(1) The court cannot grant an application for leave under this Division unless the court is satisfied that: 

(a) the document or evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other documents or evidence produced or adduced or to be produced or adduced by the party seeking to produce or adduce the document or evidence, have substantial probative value, and 

(b) other documents or evidence concerning the matters to which the protected confidence relates are not available, and 

(c) the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidence and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of a document of substantial probative value. 

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of determining the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm, the court must take into account the following: 

(a) the need to encourage victims of sexual offences to seek counselling, 

(b) that the effectiveness of counselling is likely to be dependent on the maintenance of the confidentiality of the counselling relationship, 

(c) the public interest in ensuring that victims of sexual offences receive effective counselling, 

(d) that the disclosure of the protected confidence is likely to damage or undermine the relationship between the counsellor and the counselled person, 

(e) whether disclosure of the protected confidence is sought on the basis of a discriminatory belief or bias, 

(f) that the adducing of the evidence is likely to infringe a reasonable expectation of privacy. 

(3) For the purposes of determining an application for leave under this Division, the court may permit a confidential statement to be made to it by or on behalf of the principal protected confider by affidavit specifying the harm the confider is likely to suffer if the application for leave is granted. 

(4) A court must not disclose or make available to a party (other than the principal protected confider) any confidential statement made to the court under this section by or on behalf of the principal protected confider. 

(5) The court must state its reasons for granting or refusing to grant an application for leave under this Division. 

(6) If there is a jury, the court is to hear and determine any application for leave under this Division in the absence of the jury."" 

35Consideration of this section requires consideration of all the relevant evidence produced including of course the contents of the subpoenaed material, exhibits E and F, the confidential affidavits filed in relation to this matter and permitted so to be filed without crossexamination pursuant to the terms of s 299D(3) and of course s 299(4) of the Act which prevents disclosure of the material to any party other than of course the party swearing the affidavits. Other material that is relevant to a consideration of s 299D in this matter, of course, includes the statement of the complainant, the medical records that have been tendered from the Crown brief, and some of the other material that I have earlier referred to.

36To consider the issue of whether the leave sought for access be granted in the context of the test to be applied under 299D it is appropriate, perhaps, at this point to summarise the submissions that were made by the accused and the complainant's learned counsels. Firstly, on behalf of the accused it was submitted that the material contained within the subpoenaed material that would have substantial probative value, and would in submission satisfy the requirements in order to grant leave, would include material that focussed upon the history and/or diagnoses of the mental and mental states of the complainant, particularly material relating to mental health and mental states arising from matters such as:

(1)the breakdown of relationships;

(2)the effects of medication;

(3)the symptomology of disorders already disclosed in the material, such as bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.

37To summarise what was put on behalf of the accused: it was submitted that material reflecting upon the presence of delusions, hallucinations, proclivity for violence, inappropriate behaviour, would be material relevantly of substantive probative value. It was submitted that the use, abuse, and effects of a range of medications identified in the submissions of the accused would be of substantial probative value in the context of what was already known to be the medication either present in the complainant's system if could use that expression in the general sense from the urine test and admitted to or revealed by the complainant when she was medically examined after the alleged sexual assaults.

38It was submitted that medical histories and diagnoses of the effects of those medications and other related matters were capable of reflecting upon the behaviour of the complainant, which was inconsistent with the guilt of the accused as alleged by the Crown, based upon the contents of the complainant's statement; or which, alternatively, may point to the ""innocence"" of the accused. It is submitted on behalf of the accused, in the context of that rubric, that what is required to permit access to the documents under the legislation particularly s 299D(1) of the Act can be made out.

39In the course of submissions counsel for the accused made reference to the seriousness of the charges brought against the accused as a relevant factor to the balancing test if I might describe it as that set out in s 299D(1)(c) of the Act. This is a matter not specifically adverted to in the legislation. This situation might be compared with s 126B, Evidence Act 1995, to which I was referred by learned counsel for the accused. Whilst I have the greatest respect for the learned author, Mr Odgers SC, the bottom line is that what I was referred to in his helpful textbook, reflects what that provision expressly states concerning considerations relevant to the determination of matters under that section. That having been said, of course, it might be fairly said that the character of the allegation or its ""seriousness"" is implicitly to be considered by reference to the use of the ""public interest"" test in the balancing exercise, particularly militating in favour of a grant of leave pursuant to s 299D(1)(c) if appropriate. It has not been an important matter here.

40I note in the material sought to gain access to, applying the test of relevance as required under s 55 Evidence Act 1995, that there is obviously a great public interest in an accused having access to relevant material which would provide the basis for admissible evidence that could be considered in determining whether there was a reasonable doubt as to his guilt of a serious crime subject of course to considering the countervailing public interest reflected in the provision in protecting the confidentiality of protected confidences. Learned counsel for the accused, however, held up the ""standard nonparole period"" for at least one of the offences as some sort of totem pole for consideration under this section. In my view the standard nonparole period is completely irrelevant to this task.

41The complainant's submission centred upon, in this aspect of the proceedings, the material contained within the affidavits, exhibit E and exhibit F. The second affidavit was one, as I understand it, sworn yesterday. The first affidavit was available for her Honour Judge Flannery SC, who entertained this application to a considerable extent last week without reaching a decision, transferring the matter to the ultimate trial judge on the application of the parties.

42It was conceded in the submissions of learned counsel for the complainant that the second affidavit in its terms adds little to the substance of the matters relied upon as militating in favour of a refusal of leave. By reference particularly to paras 8 and 12 of exhibit E, it was essentially contended, to summarise learned counsel's submissions and hoping not to do any disservice to them, that the relevant harm upon the complainant in the context of the matters to be considered pursuant to s 299D would be:

(1)The effect of disclosure upon current treatment;

(2)The effect upon the complainant in obtaining future treatment for her conditions;

(3)The effect on the complainant of giving evidence.

43A reference was made to a particular paragraph in the affidavit sustaining that last matter. The claim of the complainant, with respect, is ""impenetrable"", but ultimately of little substantial probative value in the context of all the issues that I have had to consider in relation to this matter.

44I also note the general fears of the complainant which permeate both affidavits and were referred to in submission. Much of the material in the affidavits reflecting upon general fears, or specific fears, may be seen to be material reflecting concerns about giving evidence that might reasonably be seen as common in many cases involving alleged acts of violence including sexual assault, in circumstances where a complainant is required to give evidence of what must be highly traumatic events.

45On the other hand, the specific issue raised in relation to the subpoenaed material, that is material relating to her medical conditions, her mental health and medications she received and related issues, are matters that were volunteered by the complainant to the police in her original statement and which, on the material available to me, had been discussed freely by her, admittedly in private and not in a Court, with acquaintances such as Mr F and Mr P, apparently a friend of the accused. As I understand it, laying sub silento in the matter, the matters that arise out of the subpoenaed material are matters that have been discussed by the complainant with the accused.

46I have already pointed out that Mr P's knowledge of the complainant, his friendship with her, emanates from his much greater, longer relationship with the accused. 

47To get to the specifics, however, of the material that I have examined, a number of the matters adverted to in the affidavit evidence of the complainant, and reflected in the submissions, in reality fall away. There is nothing in the hospital notes relating to any counselling in the sense reflected in the legislation by Dr S after 2005. In fact, although the notes are somewhat illegible, Dr S's notes themselves are very distinctive in their handwriting and are perhaps the most legible notes of the lot, apart from some nursing notes which I am not permitting access to and cover a period from 2002 to 2005. In the context of the material that is in the public domain, it might be said as a general comment that his records and other records are entirely uncontroversial.

48The records that I will grant leave for access to be granted to the accused to examine have substantial probative value reflecting histories given by the complainant or diagnoses of the complainant sometimes in summarised form, although, largely not in the form of what could be called ""clinical notes"" in the narrow sense. I appreciate the notes that have been produced which run to 2005 and not beyond have some antiquity and it might be said they may diminish in probative value with greater age. However, in the context of the statement of the complainant and the medical history given by her in May 2011, the material to which I will grant leave for access provides a historical explanation of contemporary conditions to the events giving rise to the charges.

49Particularly by reference to the matters adverted to in s 299D(2) and noting of course the matters set out in subparas (a) to (f) are an inclusive list, the provision commencing with the words ""without limiting the matters the Court may take into account"" for the purposes of determining the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences, I note firstly, that none of the relevant ""counselling notes"" relate to any alleged sexual assault and certainly, by definition, to these specific allegations. Secondly, they are all historical records of medical treatment for a range of psychiatric and, for want of a better word, psychological conditions.

50As to the important issue of the reasonable expectation of privacy reflected in s 299D(2)(f) of the Act, I note that whilst this would be reasonably anticipated by the complainant, or any patient, it does not of itself, or in conjunction with the other matters to be taken into account, prevent a grant of leave noting the test in s 299D(1) and the legislative purpose of these provisions. 

51In relation to this issue of privacy I hasten to say, in conjunction with the concerns raised by the complainant in some of her affidavit evidence, I do not propose to permit access to all of the material that is produced. A number of reasons exist for this.

(1)There is a need for editing of the material which leave will be granted for access to be given to the accused's legal representative, to delete what within the material is clearly irrelevant or material of no substantive value;

(2)There are notes such as nursing notes, pathology results and pathology testing that appears on its face and in its terms either not to be of substantive probative value or not otherwise of being capable of satisfying the balancing tests that are required under s 299D(1);

(3)There is some material of a purely private nature that could not possibly be of any interest to any reasonable party concerned with these proceedings. This includes, as I foreshadowed, some matters of sexual history that in my view that could not possibly be admissible pursuant to s 293 CPA, particularly as some of them relate to events occurring seven, eight, nine, ten years before the relevant events giving rise to the charge;

(4)There is a great deal of repetition in the material and to that extent where I have felt that there is just pure repetition I have determined there is no need to grant leave for access to the accused of some of the material.

Conclusion

52Thus, for these reasons having had regard to all of the submissions and all of the relevant evidence that has been adduced and noting the terms of s 299D, I am satisfied that the material that I will grant leave for access to be given to the accused's legal representatives does have substantial probative value, that other documents relating to the matters to which the protected confidence relates are not available and that the public interest preserving the confidentiality of the protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in permitting access to the document or admitting into evidence information or the contents of the document in particular circumstances and is of substantial probative value (s 299D(1)(c)).

		05 October 2012",2012-05-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2759195,JM v R [2012] NSWCCA 83,"Judgment

1WHEALY JA: In this matter I have had the privilege of reading the draft decision of Simpson J. Regrettably, I have come to the conclusion that I am unable to agree with her Honour's careful decision in a number of areas, and as a consequence I am unable to agree with the re-sentence of the applicant as proposed by her Honour. I agree that this Court must re-sentence the applicant but, for my part, consider that the non-parole period ought be for a more substantial period than that selected by Simpson J.

2The particular areas in which I am unable to agree are these:

i)I do not agree that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive (Ground 2)

ii)I do not agree that the circumstances of this matter obliged or entitled the sentencing judge to find that there were special circumstances, within the meaning of s 19(3), s 19(4) and (4A) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) (Ground 2)

iii)while I accept that a sentencing Court may, in an appropriate case, take into account the nature of the custody to be served by a prisoner, I do not agree that this can be regarded as a factor properly to be taken into account in circumstances where that factor, either directly or indirectly, is used to avoid or, in any event, has the consequence of avoiding or overriding a statutory prohibition or mandate (Ground 3).

3I agree, however, with Simpson J's findings that there was no identifiable error in the sentencing remarks concerning the effect of the applicant's youth on the sentence selected (Ground 4). I also accept, for the reasons identified by her Honour, that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the lack of proportion between the sentence imposed on him and that imposed on ZBN, the other participant in the attack upon the victim. Whereas the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of four (in relation to Count 1 in the indictment), ZBN (who pleaded guilty to a charge of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm - s 35 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) - was sentenced to imprisonment for two years, with the sentence being entirely suspended on specified conditions.

The attack upon the victim

4The facts are fully set out in Simpson J's decision. Those facts show that this was an extremely violent instance of the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon the victim. The attack arose out of an argument at a party and from what was perceived by the applicant to be a racial slur. The applicant had consumed a large amount of alcohol and an ecstasy tablet. The evidence showed that the applicant, after he had been ordered to leave the party, told his friends he wanted ""to find the victim and get him"". Some time later that evening the opportunity presented itself. The victim, and another friend, were on their way home but were clearly apprehensive and fearful of retaliation. When they eventually encountered the applicant and his cohorts, the victim attempted to flee. Notwithstanding that he ran some little distance, he was shoulder charged and/or tackled by ZBN. This left him on the ground at the mercy of the applicant who proceeded to carry out his earlier threat. The victim was sixteen and a half years of age at the time and was much smaller than the applicant. While he was on the ground the applicant bashed his head into the bitumen and kicked and punched him in the head and torso. ZBN kicked the victim at least once.

5The consequences of this attack were disastrous for the victim, who has remained significantly impaired as a consequence of the attack. It is not anticipated that he will ever regain his pre-injury level of cognitive function. His ability to work, drive a motor vehicle and to mix socially has been significantly reduced on a permanent basis. His life has been ruined.

6It is clear that this was a deliberate and relatively sustained violent attack on a defenceless youth. Although the applicant expressed remorse at the hearing, he had initially blamed ""unknown persons"" for the assault on the victim, and implicated ZBN. He did not plead guilty until the day when his trial was to begin. The offence occurred upon a public street in Wagga.

Grounds of appeal

7I shall briefly comment on each of the grounds of appeal.

8I agree that the parity ground (Ground 1) has been made good. I agree with Simpson J that ZBN was plainly involved in the attack, had knocked the victim to the ground and kicked him while he was there. It is true that the agreed statement of facts at ZBN's sentencing referred to the fact that he, earlier in the evening had, in a rather desultory fashion, endeavoured to dissuade the present applicant from seeking out the victim for retaliation. It is also true that ZBN did not intend that the victim's head would be rammed into the ground as it was, and that his involvement in the injuries sustained by the victim was considerably less than that of the applicant. Nevertheless, I agree with Simpson J that the disparity between his sentence and that imposed on the applicant was, in all the circumstances, excessive, giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant.

9In relation to Ground 2, I do not think the sentence imposed on the applicant, viewed on its own, was manifestly excessive. There is no contradiction or inconsistency between this view and my earlier stated view that the disparity ground has been made good. It will often be the case that a sentence imposed on an offender is not itself manifestly excessive but, when account is had to the sentence imposed on a co-offender, the disparity itself will be seen as manifestly excessive.

10For the reasons given in outlining the nature of the attack on the victim, I conclude that a very significant sentence was warranted. The applicant's actions were deliberate, to a degree premeditated and had terrible consequences for the victim: R v Mitchell, R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296, at [27]. The present situation was an example of street violence at a very high level. The need to deter young men in company, often intoxicated, from indulging in violence of this kind in public streets can hardly be overstated. This Court has said on repeated occasions that such acts need to be addressed by sentences that carry a very significant degree of general deterrence: SJ v R [2011] NSWCCA 160. And this is so notwithstanding the youth of an offender: AI v R; R v SB and AI [2011] NSWCCA 95 per Hodgson JA at [69]; R v DGP [2009] NSWSC 1154 at [101]-[102]; MS2 v R [2005] NSWCCA 397 per Simpson J.

11The applicant relied on two aspects of the sentencing remarks in support of his argument that manifest excess had been demonstrated. The first was the finding that the objective gravity of the offence was below the mid-range of objective gravity ""but only just"". Simpson J reads the sentencing judge's decision in this area as indicating that the penalty imposed was one appropriate to a case where the standard non-parole period applied. I do not, for my part, read the sentencing judge's decision in that way. In my opinion, read fairly, her Honour was doing no more than endeavouring to state the level of objective seriousness of the applicant's offending. It is apparent from the whole of the remarks on sentence that her Honour was well aware that the standard non-parole system did not apply to the sentencing exercise she was undertaking. This appears not only from her remarks on sentence, but also from the submissions that were made to her by legal representatives for both the Crown and defence and her response to those submissions.

12A determination of where on the scale of criminality an offence lies must be regarded as an essential part of the sentencing process, whether or not the offence attracts a standard non-parole period: King v R [2011] NSWCCA 46. Nowhere in the remarks on sentence does her Honour indicate that she was undertaking a two-staged approach in determining the appropriate sentence. Her Honour simply determined where on the scale of criminality the offence lay, and this was something she was entitled to do, indeed, obliged to do.

13The second aspect of the sentencing relied on by the applicant was the treatment of the applicant's youth. Both Simpson J and I recognise that the principal offence here was at an extreme level of seriousness, particularly having regard to the consequences to the victim. Where we respectfully part company is in relation to whether the applicant's youth overbore this consideration. In my opinion, it did not. I have said enough earlier as to the nature of the crime and the need to reflect personal and general deterrence in this sentence. Notwithstanding the objects in s 6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, the present matter called for a stern sentence. In my opinion, her Honour appropriately took into account the applicant's youth, the effect of his intoxication, his plea of guilty and remorse, as well as his excellent prospects of rehabilitation and his proper observance of his strict bail conditions and nightly curfew since the time of his arrest. She also took into account the fact that he was unlikely to re-offend. In my opinion, notwithstanding that he was seventeen years and four months at the time of the offence, given the nature of the offence and the other matters to which I have referred, her Honour's sentence fell within a sound range of appropriate discretion. I would not find that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

14Ground 3 relates to the recommendation made by the sentencing judge in relation to the applicant's serving his sentence in a juvenile detention centre until he attained the age of twenty-one years and six months. I agree with Simpson J that the legislation required the making of an order rather than the giving of a recommendation, if it were open to make such an order.

15I also agree with Simpson J's careful and thorough analysis of the sections in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. The principal offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty was plainly ""a serious children's indictable offence"", as Simpson J noted. This meant that the applicant was ineligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after he had attained the age of eighteen, unless there were either special circumstances justifying his detention as a juvenile offender after that age or, in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period had been set, the non-parole period would end within six months after he had attained that age. 

16The conclusion reached (favourably to the applicant) by Simpson J was that the applicant's ADD condition (diagnosed by Dr Rowe) fell within the definition of ""disability"" where appearing in the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW). As Simpson J points out this definition is, relevantly, in the following terms:

""(e) a disorder, illness or disease that affects a person's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or that results in disturbed behaviour.""

Her Honour thought that there was no evidence that would have permitted a finding of special circumstances under s 19(4) (b) or (c). She concluded, however, that there was evidence sufficient to permit a finding under s 19(4)(a) (""the person is vulnerable on account of illness or disability"" within the meaning of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977).

17In fact, although the sentencing judge made no finding, there was evidence before her Honour that might have satisfied s 4(b). This was the evidence from Mr Andrew Adams, the assistant manager of the Juvenile Justice Community Service Office in Wagga. He gave evidence pointing out the availability of psychologists and psychiatrists capable of providing treatment in the Riverina Juvenile Justice Centre, particularly for Aborigines. By contrast, he said these services were not always available in the adult Junee Correctional Centre.

18Although an order may have been capable of being made based on special circumstances arising under s 4(b), I am by no means confident that the evidence before the sentencing court entitled her Honour to make an order for a finding of special circumstances under s 4(a). I am far from confident that Dr Rowe's ""diagnosis"" of attention deficit disorder necessarily satisfied the definition of ""disability"" in the Anti-Discrimination Act. Nor was there evidence of vulnerability on account of the applicant's ADD, whatever its level of severity may have been.

19This is so for two reasons. First, I do not read the evidence as suggesting that the applicant would be vulnerable in an adult prison. Secondly, there was no evidence of the level of the applicant's ADD. The thrust of Dr Rowe's report was that ADD, coupled with significant alcohol consumption, had the likelihood of delivering ""poor outcomes"" for someone such as the applicant. What was being suggested was that medication and anger counselling, etc, would improve his self-regulation, control, attention and consequential thinking habits. Moreover, I am by no means satisfied that this previously undiagnosed and untreated ADD condition necessarily met the definition in the anti-discrimination legislation. Dr Rowe principally relied on the condition, whatever its severity or lack of it, to minimise the applicant's culpability in the commission of the offence. He did not address the issue raised by s 19(4)(a).

20One further matter requires comment: there is, it appears, a possible tension between Simpson J's remarks in her draft decision and the remarks of Howie J in TG v R [2010] NSWCCA 28. 

21Simpson J makes two points. The first is that Howie J stated that ""it would be an error for the Court to select a sentence solely for the purposes of avoiding a period in adult custody"". Consequently, Simpson J has accordingly expressed the view that some limited weight can be given to the nature of the offender's custody in the present matter, although her Honour acknowledges that the sentence cannot be fashioned solely on the basis that such recognition is designed to avoid a period in adult custody.

22In one sense, it is not necessary for me to make any comment about this aspect of Simpson J's decision. That is because the re-sentencing exercise I favour will necessarily take the applicant's non-parole period well beyond the period of one year and nine months selected by Simpson J. The consequence of that will be that, so far as my decision is concerned, the applicant will be required, subject to the determinations of the correctional authorities, to spend a portion of his custodial time in an adult prison. Although it is not strictly necessary for me to say anything in those circumstances, I would simply add that there is a distinction, in my view, between taking into account conditions of custody such as protective custody when determining a sentence to be imposed and, on the other hand, imposing a sentence which has in contemplation a statute which prohibits a person from remaining in a juvenile detention centre unless the non-parole period is below a certain figure. In the latter situation, it would seem to me to be contrary to principle to select the shorter non-parole period even where that is merely one consideration and not the sole determinant: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 and TG v R per Howie J at [24]-[25]. At the very least, the impression will have been created that the sentence has been structured with an eye to avoiding the statutory outcome. This is not permissible: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17.

Conclusion

23As the foregoing reasons demonstrate, my conclusion is that Ground 1 (parity) has been established. Further, I agree that the Judge's purported recommendation under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act was not authorised by the legislation, although no consequences, in the circumstances, flow from this. I would find that the remaining three grounds of complaint have not been established.

24Success on the disparity ground leads me to conclude that, taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles, a lesser sentence ought to be passed for the purpose of s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

25However, it remains the case that a substantial sentence of imprisonment must be imposed on the applicant. In particular, the non-parole period selected must represent the minimum term of imprisonment which the applicant should serve for this offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704, at 716-717. Moreover, the non-parole period should reflect the seriousness of the offence, the criminality involved, deterrence, retribution and other matters such as the applicant's prospects for rehabilitation. I accept that the sentencing judge's finding of special circumstances should be maintained. I also take into account the impressive material tendered with respect to re-sentencing as well as the applicant's pre-sentence conduct. Like Simpson J, I conclude that the applicant has made good use of his time in custody and has achieved, so far as can be ascertained, such rehabilitation as is needed.

26I propose the following orders.

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)In respect of the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so, appeal allowed, sentence quashed.

(3)In lieu thereof, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for five years commencing on 14 October 2010 and concluding on 13 October 2015, with a non-parole period of three years concluding on 13 October 2013.

27SIMPSON J. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court at Wagga Wagga on 14 October 2010 following his pleas of guilty to two counts on an indictment. The first and more serious count is for an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so, which, pursuant to s 33(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. (Pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") a standard non-parole period of 7 years is prescribed, but, by reason of the applicant's plea of guilty - see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 - and by reason of his age - see Sentencing Procedure Act s 54D(3) - this does not apply to the present offence.) The second count was of affray, which, pursuant to s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act, carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.

28The applicant was 17 years and 4 months of age at the time of the commission of the offences, and was therefore a child within the meaning of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (""the Children (CP) Act""). By reason of the maximum penalty applicable to the first offence, however, which brought it within the definition in that Act of ""serious children's indictable offence"", he was required to be dealt with according to law: Children (CP) Act, s 17.

29On the first count, English DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 7 years, commencing on 14 October 2010 and expiring on 13 October 2017, with a non-parole period of 4 years, which will expire on 13 October 2014. On the second count she imposed a wholly concurrent fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months.

30In sentencing the applicant as she did, she allowed, in respect of the pleas of guilty and pursuant to the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, a reduction of 10% in the sentence she otherwise would have imposed. This was because the pleas were entered on the date fixed for trial and had therefore limited utilitarian value. Pursuant to s44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, her Honour found special circumstances justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence. The reduction she allowed was quite a significant one. On the statutory proportions, a head sentence of 7 years would involve a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months.

31She made a recommendation that, until the applicant attains the age of 21 years and 6 months, he be detained in the Riverina Juvenile Detention Centre. (The recommendation was purportedly made under s 19 of the Children (CP) Act. It was agreed that that section provides for a direction made by order and not a recommendation. In fact, the recommendation was deficient for other reasons, to which I will come.)

The facts

32The facts, which are set out in an agreed statement, disclose two extremely serious offences. Both arose out of a birthday party at a private residence in a suburb of Wagga Wagga that began on Saturday, 31 May 2008. (Given that all participants in the events were, at the time, under the age of 18, I will refer to all of them, including the victims, by initials.) MF-D (the victim of the first offence) and MP (the victim of the second offence) both attended the birthday party. Both had consumed alcohol, and both had used ecstasy.

33The applicant also attended the party, as did two co-offenders, DFA and ZBN. Late in the evening an altercation took place between MF-D and the applicant. MF-D took the applicant by the shirt, pushed him against a wall and said, ""I'm sick of your kind"". The applicant is of Aboriginal descent and took this to be a racial slur.

34At about 2.00 am the following morning MF-D and MP left the party, having made arrangements for a taxi to pick them up at a nearby location. It is likely that they left because asked to do so as a result of the earlier altercation between MF-D and the applicant. In any event, they walked a little distance, but thought they were being followed, and concealed themselves in a narrow laneway. They emerged from the laneway to see one person banging two bottles together and laughing, plus one group of four people and two others. MF-D ran between the two groups, and was followed by two men, one from each group. These were plainly the applicant and either ZBN or DFA.

35MF-D ran towards a car park, but was shoulder-charged or tackled by ZBN and was then assaulted by the applicant, who hit his head into the bitumen, and kicked and punched him in the torso. ZBN also kicked MF-D at least once.

36MP ran after MF-D and was tackled to the ground. A bottle was smashed over his head. He was kicked all over his body and head, by at least two, possibly three, people. (This was the offence of affray in which the applicant admitted his involvement. It is difficult to define precisely his participation. That, no doubt, is why the offence charged was of affray.) MP attempted to run away but was head-butted by DFA. He rose after a time and attempted to assist MF-D, who by this time was lying unconscious on the ground. 

37The injuries suffered by MP were a sore, lacerated wrist, cuts, swelling and bleeding to his face, a broken nose, and two front teeth completely dislodged. His wrist required sutures and his teeth required dental treatment. A poor prognosis for each of the teeth was given.

38MF-D, who was 16 ½ years of age at the time, suffered very serious injuries indeed, evidence of which was given by a medical report dated 13 October 2010. He had a significant head injury with right frontal inter-cranial haemorrhage and right fronto-temporal acute subdural haemorrhage associated with intra-cerebral haemorrhage. For about 10 days he was left in a medically induced coma with intubation. On 10 June 2008, because of improvement, he was transferred to the Liverpool Brain Injury Clinic. He suffered 17 days of post-traumatic amnesia and has no memory of the assault. He has experienced seizures and post-traumatic shock and anxiety. By October 2010, when an updated medical report was provided, his post-traumatic stress disorder had partly resolved, and his anxiety and hyper-vigilance had reduced. However, his social life was restricted and he avoided social occasions.

39In March 2010, he developed epileptic seizures for which he will, in the long term, require medication. His driver's licence has been suspended as a result. This has impacted on his capacity to obtain employment. Although some improvement in memory, cognition and information processing has been demonstrated, as at October 2010, he retained significant impairment. Return of cognitive function to pre-injury level was not anticipated.

40He provided a Victim Impact Statement, dated 11 October 2010. He said that he had lost his apprenticeship as a butcher, and he loses his licence for six months following each seizure, and he has lost some of the removalist work he had previously been able to obtain. He sometimes feels a little depressed. He has severely reduced his social life. He found that employers in trades find it more difficult to employ people with disability. He recognised that it would be difficult for him to finish a trade or find a new one. He concluded by saying:

""The rest of the problems I have from this I would rather keep to the family and close people.""

41The applicant was arrested on 4 June 2008 and interviewed. Initially, he blamed ""unknown persons"" for the assault on MF-D, but implicated ZBN. He was granted bail on that day and remained at liberty on bail, subject to relatively stringent conditions, until the date of sentence - two years and four months later. The bail conditions included ""a night curfew"".

The co-offenders

42DFA, who was 16 years of age at the time of the offence, appeared before the Children's Court in Wagga Wagga on 10 August 2010, where he admitted his guilt of an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, an offence against s 35 of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. The Children's Court magistrate imposed a control order for 6 months, which he suspended, conditional upon DFA being of good behaviour for that period.

43ZBN was committed for trial on three counts, one an offence against s 33(1), of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so, an alternative count of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm (under s 35 of the Crimes Act) and a third count, not in the alternative, of affray. On the day fixed for trial he entered a plea of guilty to the alternative count of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm upon MF-D. The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. That is the offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Significantly it does not come within the definition in the Children (CP) Act of ""serious children's indictable offence"". ZBN also came for sentence before English DCJ, almost two months after her Honour had sentenced the applicant. ZBN was also 17 at the date of the offence, but was some months older than the applicant. Pursuant to s 18 of the Children (CP) Act, her Honour determined that he also should be dealt with according to law, although, in his case, this was not required. Her Honour sentenced ZBN to imprisonment for 2 years, but, pursuant to s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, suspended execution of the sentence upon specified conditions. 

44In sentencing ZBN, English DCJ noted that he had entered a plea of guilty after his trial had commenced and some evidence had been taken. She also reduced his sentence by 10%, in recognition of the utilitarian value of the plea. (The trial had been fixed with an estimate of 10 days.)

45She recounted substantial evidence of very real rehabilitation, citing positive steps taken by ZBN to contribute to the community by engaging with Aboriginal youth and setting up an organisation to provide them with pro-social sporting and recreational activities to minimise their involvement in street violence and crime. She referred to evidence of extra curial punishment, in the form of retributive attacks upon the home and motor vehicles of ZBN's parents. She noted that hardship had been caused to ZBN's father, who was a serving police officer. She found that ZBN had not been intoxicated, and had in fact attempted, at one point, to dissuade the applicant from pursuing MF-D.

46She considered the question of parity, but expressly found that it ""does not arise"". This was because the applicant faced two charges, of malicious wounding and affray, and because, as a result of the applicant's actions, MF-D suffered a very substantial brain injury. She found that ZBN did not take part in the attack that caused the injury. She found that ZBN ""did not envisage for one moment"" that MF-D would suffer the kind of injury that he did, and that he was expecting a fistfight and not much more than that.

47Like the applicant, ZBN was 17 at the time of the offence, although a few months older, and had no prior criminal record. Her Honour found that he was ""truly remorseful and contrite"". She found that, on the scale of objective gravity, ZBN's offence fell ""towards the lower end"", because of his limited role. In so finding, she acknowledged the serious and substantial ongoing effect of the harm suffered by MF-D.

48It will be necessary to consider further the sentences imposed on the co-offenders.

The applicant's personal circumstances

49Evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances was put before her Honour by way of a report by the Office of Juvenile Justice and a neuro-psychological report, as well as oral evidence from the applicant, his grandmother, and the assistant manager of Juvenile Justice Community Services office in Wagga Wagga. 

50The applicant was born in February 1991 and was 17 years and 4 months as at the date of the offence. He had no criminal history. He was born in Sydney, but the family moved to Wagga Wagga when he was young. He has no knowledge of his father and was raised by his mother. By 2010, his mother was living with her three other children in Tumut. At that time the applicant was living with his grandmother in a suburb of Wagga Wagga, in order to attend a particular high school. At school he was a competent, even talented, sportsman, but was not so competent or enthusiastic academically. He also participated in a variety of programmes aimed at assisting in the transition from school to work, and in various vocational programmes. His grandmother described him as ""pleasant and co-operative"" in the house. 

51His grandmother is confined to a wheelchair, having had a leg amputated due to diabetes. The applicant was called upon to give her a considerable degree of assistance, which he did willingly. Also living in the house was an uncle, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.

52The two officers of the Office of Juvenile Justice who signed the report stated that the applicant had acknowledged that on the night of the offence he was intoxicated and had consumed ecstasy. In his evidence the applicant denied the assertion concerning ecstasy. However, he said that in compliance with his bail conditions he had not consumed alcohol or drugs since his arrest.

53The officers appear to have taken a favourable view of the applicant. They suggested that he would benefit from alcohol and other drugs programmes, in order to broaden his understanding of the negative effects of alcohol and illicit drug use and provide him with strategies to limit ""negative"" actions in the future. They said that he had demonstrated a willingness to ""skill himself"" to improve his chances of worthwhile employment in the construction industry, and that he had demonstrated a positive work ethic. They accepted that he was ""indeed very remorseful for his actions"" and had taken steps towards his own rehabilitation.

54The neuro-psychological report opened by referring to: 

""... a cluster of psychiatric symptoms, history, and cognitive impairment and weaknesses which can be described as an attention deficit disorder (ADD) and a prior clinically significant altered mental state known as severe alcohol intoxication ... .""

There is no evidence that the applicant had previously been diagnosed as suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder.

55The author of the report, Dr Rowe, expressed the view that, at the time of the offence, the applicant was:

""... affected by a severe alcohol intoxication together with a cognitive impairment associated with ADD, leading to increased impulsivity, impaired judgment and attention, and reduced emotional stability"". 

He repeated this, sometimes in different words, on a number of occasions throughout the report. He also said:

""Given that [the applicant's] character appears to be of a relatively naïve nature, lower intellectual ability and an openness to suggestibility, the potential incarceration of [the applicant] might lead to a more negative outcome rather than a good behaviour bond which forces him to participate in treatment and rehabilitation.""

56Dr Rowe recorded that the applicant told him that on the night of the offences, he had probably drunk 11 or 12 full strength beers, and that the perceived racial slur made him ""very wild"". He considered that had the applicant not been affected by such a high level of alcohol intoxication, or had not suffered from ADD, it was likely that he would not have committed the offence.

57He found the applicant to be within the low average range of verbal intellectual ability.

58In his evidence the applicant again expressed remorse and regret for his conduct. He said that the ""racial slur"" had:

"" ... made me upset and a bit wild"".

He said that he had been undertaking a TAFE course in horticulture and was enrolled with an employment agency. He said that, as a result of the offences, he had been expelled from an AFL football team with whom he played.

59In cross-examination he said that he had been aggressive on the night of the offence because he had been drinking and was ""a bit wild as well"". He said that he had not consumed any alcohol or drugs since the offence.

60The applicant's grandmother confirmed that she depended significantly upon the applicant. She was unable to count on assistance from her son because of his psychiatric condition.

The Remarks on Sentence

61In her Remarks on Sentence, English DCJ conventionally recounted the facts of the offence, and the evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances. She noted that, in the two and a half years since his arrest, he had complied with strict bail conditions, including the night curfew which severely limited his freedom. She accepted his evidence that he had not consumed any alcohol or illicit substances, and that the precipitant for his offence was what he perceived to be a racial slur.

62Her Honour perceived a difference between what the applicant said in evidence concerning the precipitant of the offence, and what he said on the same subject to Dr Rowe. In evidence, in chief, he said that the comment by MF-D ""I'm sick of your kind"" made him ""upset and a bit wild""; Dr Rowe recorded that the applicant told him that the ""racial slur"" made him ""very wild"", but this was in the context of his significant level of intoxication. 

63I interpolate here that, when regard is had to the evidence the applicant gave in cross-examination, it is clear that he was saying that his response to the offensive comment was alcohol related. Any difference between the responses given by the applicant is of no significance.

64The judge expressed doubts about some parts of Dr Rowe's report, finding that some of the opinions he expressed fell outside his area of expertise. One of the opinions she rejected expressly was that the applicant had a ""prior clinically significant altered mental state known as severe alcohol intoxication"". Another opinion she rejected was that the applicant had an increased level of impulsivity, impaired judgment and a reduced emotional stability due to his attention deficit disorder, and high level of alcohol intoxication. Her reason for this conclusion appears to lie in the two sentences that follow that conclusion. They are:

""He does not provide an opinion that the offender at the time was particularly immature for his age. At its highest his report refers to the offender being relatively naïve and of lower intellectual ability.""

It is plain that she accepted other opinions expressed by Dr Rowe.

65Having regard to the applicant's prior good character, she accepted that, had he not been intoxicated, the offence would probably not have occurred, but maintained that this could not be seen to have been related to a mental illness, which would ordinarily be expected to have resulted in a history of criminal activity.

66She went on to say:

""Be that as it may, he has committed a cowardly, violent act which has resulted in a substantial ongoing permanent cognitive impairment of another young man whose life now has been irreparably damaged.""

67She found a level of premeditation, and that the offence was:

"" ... an ongoing, particularly vicious assault upon the victim, not just one blow which felled him. The victim had been shoulder-charged and tackled by the co-accused [ZBN]. He was then assaulted by this offender. The offender hit the victim's head into the bitumen, kicked him and punched him a number of times. The victim was left lying unconscious on the ground and was heard to let out a long painful cry.""

68She nevertheless accepted as a mitigating factor that the applicant thought that he had been racially slurred but observed that that did not entitle him to seek retribution by a violent assault, leaving the victim permanently brain-damaged. That circumstance, therefore, had limited mitigating value, and operated as an explanation, not an excuse. She made a similar finding in relation to intoxication.

69Her Honour then dealt further with the applicant's youth. She said:

""The one final matter which needs consideration is the role that the offender's cognitive, emotional and psychological immaturity had to play in the commission of this offence. The law, with good reason, recognises youth and not just biological age. Where immaturity is a significant contributing factor the criminality will be less serious than if the same offence had been committed by an adult.""

70She cited a remark made by Sully J in R v Mastronardi [2000] NSWCCA 12; 111 A Crim R 306, that,

"" ... age is not a cloak of convenience behind which a juvenile can hide.""

She found that the applicant had acted ""in a most adult way"". She said:

""He took offence, he made plain his intention to pursue his victim and when he caught up with him he viciously assaulted him. He pursued a victim who was running away from him. It is also to be borne in mind that it was an offence committed in company which no doubt doubled the victim's fear at the time.""

She then held:

""It is difficult in the circumstances to make a finding that his youth and immaturity were not commensurate with his biological age. Indeed, the evidence would appear to be to the contrary, that is, that he was a well-adjusted young man who normally was a law abiding citizen and respectful to his elders. He was not someone who came from an abusive, dysfunctional background. He has had what appears to be a relatively stable upbringing and was encouraged to attend school and did so except for the last year when there appear to have been some difficulties academically.""

71She accepted, in the light of the Juvenile Justice report, that the applicant was ""truly remorseful and contrite"". She found that he had excellent prospects for rehabilitation and was highly unlikely to re-offend and that the offence was an aberration. Nevertheless, she noted that the objective seriousness of the offence was such that a full time custodial sentence was warranted. In this respect she considered that general deterrence had a significant role to play.

72She observed that she was faced with ""a difficult sentencing task"", having before her a young offender, of previously unblemished character, who had committed:

""... one of the most serious offences in the criminal calendar leaving his victim with substantial permanent ongoing brain damage.""

73She expressly rejected a submission made on behalf of the Crown that the offence fell above the mid-range of objective seriousness (a reference to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act). She found, instead, that it fell: 

""... just below the mid-range of objective seriousness although only just"".

74She turned her attention then to the offence of affray, and the victim MP. She noted the penalty imposed upon the co-offender DFA (ZBN then not having been sentenced). She found that, despite there being two victims and two charges, the offences clearly arose out of one course of criminal conduct and noted her intention of ordering that both sentences be served concurrently.

75She made the finding of special circumstances, permitting departure from the statutory regime between the non-parole period and the head sentence, to which I have referred above, and made the recommendation, also set out above, concerning the nature of the applicant's custody, and imposed the sentences, also set out in the opening paragraph of these reasons.

76It is convenient here to outline the effect of what was ordered and intended by her Honour.

77The applicant entered into custody on 14 October 2010. He was then 19 years and 8 months of age. He would serve his sentence, until he attained 21 years and 6 months (on 3 August 2012) in juvenile detention. He would serve the balance of his non-parole period (2 years and 2 months, expiring on 13 October 2014) in whatever adult facility the authorities determined.

The grounds of the application.

78Initially, two grounds of the application were pleaded. These were:

""1.The applicant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender, ZBN.

2.The sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.""

79At the hearing of the application, leave was granted to the applicant to add two additional grounds. These were:

""Ground 3:The sentencing judge erred in failing to make an order pursuant to s 19(3) of the Children (Criminal Proceeding) Act that the applicant serve his non-parole period in juvenile detention.

Ground 4.The sentencing judge erred did not properly assess [sic], in accordance with accepted principle, the extent to which the applicant's immaturity was a factor in the commission of the offence.""

Ground 1: Parity

80The written submission filed on behalf of the applicant contained a table identifying both distinctions and similarities between the cases of ZBN and the applicant. Similarities included:

their ages: both were 17 at the time of the offence[s], ZBN 20 at sentencing, the applicant 19;

both were of prior good character;
both entered pleas of guilty on the day fixed for trial, although ZBN did so after some witnesses had given evidence (the materials in this Court do not directly disclose the extent to which the trial had progressed, or which of the witnesses had given evidence);
both were found to have excellent prospects of rehabilitation;
both had complied over a lengthy period with strict bail conditions.

81Distinctions between the two included:


the applicant pleaded guilty to two counts, one of which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years; ZBN pleaded guilty to a single count, carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years;
ZBN had suffered a certain amount of extra-curial punishment, and family hardship (his father having been a police officer);
the offence committed by ZBN was at the lower end of objective gravity (for a s 35 offence); the offence committed by the applicant was ""just below the mid-range of objectively gravity"" (for a s 33 offence).

82Not mentioned in the table, but of paramount significance, is the role played by each of the offenders. In this respect, her Honour made important findings concerning ZBN's participation; also important was the finding that he had attempted to dissuade the applicant from the path he was pursuing.

Consideration

83The parity principle is not difficult to state. It can present significant practical dilemmas in its application. The principle was encapsulated in the judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301-2 as follows:

""The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen [[1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606], recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to 'a justifiable sense of grievance'. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.

Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.""


Their Honours went on to identify two circumstances of that case that called for a lesser sentence to be imposed one offender than the other.

84A number of the concepts included in that passage are here material. The first trio are ""relevant differences"", ""different degrees of culpability"", and ""different circumstances"".

85It is necessary to examine each of these in relation to the applicant and ZBN. (No parity ground of appeal is raised in respect of DFA.)

86The differences in the culpability of the two are significant. The agreed statement of facts shows that ZBN ""shoulder-charged or tackled"" MF-D, and kicked him at least once. It also showed that the applicant, taking advantage of MF-D's position on the ground as a result of the action taken by ZBN, hit his head into the bitumen and kicked him and punched him in the head and torso. The actions of the applicant were significantly more sustained and prolonged than those of ZBN. It is an inevitable conclusion that the most significant injuries caused to MF-D were caused by the actions of the applicant.

87Also relevant are differences in the charges to which the two pleaded guilty; the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge in which the mental element was intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and which therefore carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years; ZBN to an offence in which the mental element was recklessness (meaning that he envisaged the possibility of grievous bodily harm, but did not intend to cause such harm - Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93, at [78]), carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Those differences must necessarily be reflected in the sentence imposed.

88In sentencing ZBN, English DCJ expressly considered the issue of parity, but found that ""it does not arise"". She noted the offences in respect of which the applicant had been sentenced and said:

""As a result of the part he had to play in this attack on that night the victim suffered a very substantial ongoing brain injury. This offender [ZBN] did not take part in that attack upon the victim causing that injury. What this offender did was to facilitate that attack by shoulder-barging the victim causing him to fall to the ground, to then be set upon by [the applicant].""

It may be that in this passage, her Honour overlooked (or was not reminded of) that part of the agreed facts (presented in relation to the applicant) in which it was asserted that ZBN had kicked MF-D at least once (although the statement does not identify to which part of the body of MF-D ZBN aimed his kick).

89Her Honour did note that ZBN expected ""only a fist fight"", and that he had earlier attempted to dissuade the applicant from pursuing MF-D. She found his moral culpability to be far less than that of his co-offenders.

90Counsel for the applicant placed considerable reliance on the fact that it was ZBN who took the initial action that rendered MF-D helpless on the ground and highly vulnerable to the applicant's subsequent violence. Her Honour expressly had regard to that circumstance.

91However, it is quite plain from the facts agreed to by the applicant that his role in the offence was significantly greater than that of ZBN. The difference in the culpability of the two offenders was very substantial.

92So far as I can see, there is little in the evidence concerning the personal circumstances of the applicant, and that concerning the personal circumstances of ZBN, to differentiate between the two. Both were 17 at the time of the offence, although ZBN was older by about 3 ½ months. In respect of ZBN English DCJ made very favourable findings concerning his rehabilitation, but this did not markedly distinguish him from the applicant.

93The second aspect of the observations extracted from Postiglione of present materiality is the question of proportionality. Even when differences, either in culpability, or in personal circumstances, or both, justify disparity in sentencing, then, nevertheless, due proportion between the sentences is to be applied.

94In oral argument, counsel who appeared for the applicant emphasised the disparity: a differential of 5 years in the head sentences (no non-parole period was specified for ZBN); moreover, execution of ZBN's sentence was wholly suspended, so that he spent no time in custody. Counsel sought to explain the disparity by reference to the treatment given by the sentencing judge to the relative youth of the applicant. That, as indicated above, became a separate ground of the application.

95I have set out above the remarks made by her Honour with respect to the youth of the applicant; in sentencing ZBN, she made only passing reference to his youth, and did not allude to the principles concerning the sentencing of young offenders. It is therefore not apparent that her Honour unduly favoured ZBN in that regard.

96However, I have concluded that there is some merit in the ""proportionality"" aspect of this ground. Although substantially less culpable, ZBN was, nevertheless, involved in the attack, and did aim the first blow, and kicked MF-D. While some disparity was both justified, and required, I have concluded that the disparity in the sentence was excessive, giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant. In due course, it will be necessary to consider the consequences of that finding.

97It is now convenient to move to ground 4.

Ground 4: Youth

98I have set out above the remarks made her Honour with respect to the youth of the applicant. The principles concerning the relevance of youth in the sentencing process have been stated in various ways, not always consistently. The major inconsistency lies in the approaches taken to whether the gravity of the offence in question has a bearing on the application of leniency that might otherwise be extended to a young offender. A suitable starting point is the decision of this Court reported as ""GDP"" (1991) 53 A Crim R 112. The offence there in question was malicious damage to property. The offender was 15 years of age at the time of sentence. The report does not state his age at the time of the offences, but from the dates given it can be calculated that he was two months short of his fifteenth birthday. At first instance, a custodial penalty was imposed. The sentencing judge had said that the ordinary principles of sentencing applied in exactly the same way as they applied to adult offenders. Of this, Mathews J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA agreed, said:

""This is not so. Quite different principles apply in the sentencing of young offenders ...""

99Having found error in that, and in another, respect, her Honour went on, in the context of reconsidering the penalty to be imposed, to turn her attention to the correct principles. Having remarked that the offences committed were prevalent amongst young people in the metropolitan area, she said:

""If general deterrence were a substantial consideration in the sentencing of this applicant, then a custodial order would almost certainly be called for.""

100However, she then referred to the then relatively recent legislative guidelines contained in s 6 of the Children (CP) Act (to which I will come in more detail below). She referred to some earlier decisions in which it had been held, for example:

""... in the case of youthful offender ... considerations of punishment and of general deterrence of others may properly be largely discarded in favour of individualised treatment of the offender, directed to his rehabilitation."": R v Wilcox, unreported, 15 August 1979, per Yeldham J; ""

and:

""In the case of a young offender there can rarely be any conflict between his interest and the public's. The public have no greater interest than that he should become a good citizen."": R v Smith [1964] Crim LR 70, adopted by Hunt J in R v Bellavia, (unreported, 16 August 1980).""

101Those latter two statements can, in my opinion, now be seen as far too broad. Indeed, that was the view taken by Mathews J in 1991, in saying that considerations of general deterrence should not be ignored completely in the sentencing of young offenders, and citing as authority a decision in R v Broad (unreported, 30 March 1984) per Street CJ. Her Honour held that, even where, in the case of an adult, principles of retribution and general deterrence were important, rehabilitation must be the primary aim in relation to an offender as young as the offender there under consideration. I pause to observe that a 14 year old offender is a far cry from one who is 17 years and 4 months, as was the applicant as the time of this offence. 

102A somewhat different approach was taken only three months later in R v Pham and R v Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128. There the offences were of robbery in company, committed in private dwellings. One offender was on bail for a similar offence, the other serving a period of probation for, inter alia, an offence of break, enter and steal. The former was under 20 years of age, the latter under 18 years of age. The appeal was by the Director of Public Prosecutions.

103Lee CJ at CL, with whom Gleeson CJ and Hunt J (as he then was) agreed, said:

""It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court's function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision in Williscroft [1975] VR 292 at 299, where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that, notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment, ie, coercive action is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society. ...

... the general principle of sentencing was expressed in Dodd (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt JJ [sic], 4 March 1991) as being one which requires there to be a reasonable proportion between sentence and the gravity of the crime committed."" (italics added)

That was, however, a case in which the offender was 27 years of age and it is plain that the court considered that treating him as a young offender was scarcely appropriate. 

104A significant decision with respect to the treatment of youthful offenders in respect of very serious crimes is R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; 124 A Crim R 451. That offender had pleaded guilty to a count of murder, and one of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Both victims were police officers, although in plain clothes, and their status was accepted as not having been known to the offender. The offender was three months short of his nineteenth birthday at the time of the offences. The sentencing judge (Wood CJ at CL) said, in his Remarks on Sentence:

""76.The age of the prisoner is also a matter which needs to be taken into account in that there is a public interest, in the case of a young offender, in imposing a sentence that preserves a proper opportunity and encouragement for rehabilitation. The considerations of punishment and general deterrence, it has been accepted, should be regarded as subordinate to the need to foster the interests of rehabilitation in the case of a young offender ... however, the significance of this factor diminishes the nearer the offender is to adulthood ... as it does when the offender conducts himself like an adult and commits a particularly serious crime ... the present is a case where these principles apply to reduce, although not entirely to exclude, any leniency that can be extended on account of the prisoner's youth."" (italics added)

105On appeal, it was submitted that:

"" ... the youth factor was not to be diminished (merely) because of the seriousness of the crime"". 

Reliance was placed on observations quoted in GDP that 

'in sentencing young people ... the consideration of general deterrence is not as important as it would be in the case of sentencing an adult and considerations of rehabilitation should always be regarded as very important indeed' "".

106Of this, this Court (Powell JA, R S Hulme and Dowd JJ) said:

""24.The ... submission is supported by the passage we have quoted and by the fact that in none of the cases is it suggested that the weight to be given to the element of youth varies depending on the seriousness of the offence. Rather is the topic dealt with in materially the same way as it is in the case of lesser offences ... . Of course that is not to say that other factors such as deterrence or retribution may not have a relatively greater part to play in the more serious offences than they do in less serious ones."" (italics added)

(It is not entirely clear, but it seems to me that ""the passage we have quoted"" was the passage from GDP.) The Court explained the principle involved as lying:

""... in at least part of the rationale for making any allowance for youth, that is, the immaturity which is usually involved. Where that immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years.""

107I find it a little difficult to reconcile the proposition there stated with the decision in Pham. The decision in Pham was cited by Spigelman CJ in R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142; 54 NSWLR 300 at 74, when his Honour said:

""Armed robberies of the character involved in the present proceedings, committed by young persons, generally with an addiction problem, are so prevalent that the objective of general deterrence is entitled to significant weight in the process of sentencing for this offence, notwithstanding the youth of the typical offender ...""

108It seems to me that the weight of authority is that the seriousness of an offence is relevant to the emphasis that can be given to the youth of an offender. That does not mean that youth is not an important consideration; but retribution and deterrence cannot, in a case as serious as the present, give way entirely or even substantially to the interests of rehabilitation. It cannot be overlooked that MF-D will for the rest of his life suffer the consequences of the applicant's action. 

109Reference has been made to R v Mastronardi (see above) in which Sully J (with whom Grove J and I agreed) said:

""20.In my opinion it is timely to make plain, yet again, that youth, - whether it is real, or merely comparative, or defined with a generous elasticity, - is not a cloak of convenience behind which, relevantly, those who deliberately engage in armed robbery can shelter from the just consequences of their conduct.""

110There is no identifiable error in the sentencing remarks concerning the effect of the applicant's youth on the sentence selected. It remains to be seen whether the principles were appropriately reflected in the sentences imposed. That question is intertwined with the items raised under the next ground to be considered, Ground 3.





Ground 3: Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act s 19

111Both counsel agreed that the sentencing judge was in error in making a recommendation, as distinct from an order, that the applicant serve his sentence in a juvenile detention centre until he attains the age of 21 years and 6 months; they were united in urging that this Court substitute an order in those terms.

112The recommendation was purportedly made under s 19(3) of the Children (CP) Act, and, to the extent that that section is framed in terms of orders, but not recommendations, counsel are correct. The recommendation was also erroneous in specifying that the sentence be served in a juvenile detention centre: in 2004, subs (a) of s 19 was amended to provide for orders that the sentence be served ""as a juvenile offender"". This was, it seems, to preserve the potential of authorities to transfer, in an appropriate case, an offender to other forms of detention facilities.

113The ground has, however, exposed a different and more fundamental defect, not identified by counsel, in the approach taken by the sentencing judge. 

114Section 19 appears in Part 2, Div 4, of the Children (CP) Act. Section 19(1) provides:

""If the court sentences a person under 21 years of age to whom this Division applies to imprisonment in respect of an indictable offence, the court may, subject to this section, make an order directing that the whole or any part of the term of the sentence of imprisonment be served as a juvenile offender.""

Section 19(2) is in the following terms:

""A person is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 21 years, unless:

(a)in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has been set - the non-parole period will end within six months after the person has attained that age, or

(b)...""

115The non-parole period imposed upon the applicant will expire on 13 October 2014. The applicant will then be 23 years and 8 months of age: that is, the non-parole period will not end within six months after he has attained the age of 21 years. Section 19(2) excludes the operation of s 19(1) on the sentence imposed upon the applicant.

116Moreover, the more serious of the offences to which the applicant pleaded was, within the definition provided by s 3 of Children (CP) Act, ""a serious children's indictable offence"" because it is punishable by imprisonment for 25 years.

117Section 19(3) relevantly provides:

""A person who is sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious children's indictable offence is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 18 years, unless:

(a)the sentencing court is satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying detention of the person as a juvenile offender after that age, or

(b)in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has been set - the non-parole period will end within six months after the person has attained that age, or 

(c)...

This subsection is subject to subsection (2).""

In my opinion, it is clear that there was no power in English DCJ, and there is no power in this Court, to order that the sentence imposed (I emphasise the sentence imposed) be served as a juvenile offender. Because of subs (2), even a finding of special circumstances would not permit an order to be made that went beyond the applicant's 21st birthday.

118Subs 19(4) and (4A) are relevant. They are in the following terms:

""(4)A finding of special circumstances for the purpose of subsection ... (3) may be made on one or more of the following grounds, and not otherwise:

(a)that the person is vulnerable on account of illness or disability (within the meaning of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977), 

(b)that the only available educational, vocational training or therapeutic programs that are suitable to the person's needs are those available in detention centres,

(c)that, if the person were committed to a correctional centre, there would be an unacceptable risk of the person suffering physical or psychological harm, whether due to the nature of the person's offence, any assistance given by the person in the prosecution of other persons or otherwise.

(4A)In particular, a finding of special circumstances may not be made simply because of the person's youth or simply because the non-parole period of the person's sentence will expire while the person is still eligible to serve the sentence as a juvenile offender.""

In other words, more than mere youth is necessary to permit a finding of special circumstances.

119More is here present. At the time these reasons were prepared, the applicant was aged 20 years and 10 months. At the time of judgment he will be 21 years and three months. He has never previously been convicted of an offence and has never served any period in custody. Because of his naivety and suggestibility (as found by Dr Rowe) he is vulnerable, and will be particularly vulnerable in an adult prison. The effect of s 19 is that, if the sentence imposed is to stand, he would be transferred to an adult prison forthwith and would serve 2 years and 5 months in such a facility. (Two assumptions are inherent in the above: first, that the applicant has not already been transferred to adult custody; second, that he will be released at the expiration of his non-parole period.) That was a consideration not taken into account by the sentencing judge, because of the misunderstanding about the effect of s 19, but it is one that is, in my opinion, legitimate and relevant. The passage of time has not altered my reasoning.

120One difficulty is, because of her misunderstanding about the effect of s 19, the sentencing judge did not make findings appropriate to subs (4) and (4A). There was material that would have enabled her to do so. There was no evidence that would have permitted a finding of special circumstances under subs (4)(b) or (c). There was, however, evidence sufficient to permit a finding under subs (40)(a).

121""Disability"" (as used in subs (4)(a)) is defined in the Anti-Discrimination Act relevantly in the following terms:

""(e)a disorder, illness or disease that affects a person's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or that results in disturbed behaviour.""

It seems to me that Dr Rowe's diagnosis of Attention Deficit Disorder (which her Honour accepted) falls within this definition. 

122It would therefore have been open to the sentencing judge to have made a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of subs (3). Even that, however, would permit extension of the period the applicant can serve in the juvenile detention facility only to February 2012, when he will attain the age of 21 years.

123However, it is also my opinion that the constraint imposed by these subsections that makes it inevitable that the applicant will serve the major part of his non-parole period in an adult facility is a consideration relevant to the determination of the length of the non-parole period to be imposed. In saying this, I have not overlooked, and am indeed conscious of, subs (4A), which requires that more than mere youth is essential for a decision that would enable a juvenile offender who attains adulthood during the term of the sentence to serve that sentence as a juvenile offender. For the reasons I have already given, more than mere youth was here present.

124It is then necessary to consider whether it was an error for her Honour to fail to take into account the circumstance that the legislation precluded the course that she envisaged (even though it was plain that she was aware that some part of the sentence would be served in adult custody); and the more difficult question whether it would have been open to her to tailor the sentence to take account of, and avoid, that circumstance.

125I have concluded that the first part of the question ought to be answered affirmatively, that it was an error to fail to take into account that circumstance.

126In part, this view is based upon s 6 of the Children (CP) Act, which is relevantly in the following terms:

""A person or body that has functions under this Act is to exercise those functions having regard to the following principles:

(a)...

(b)that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions, but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,

(c)...

(d)...

(e)...

(f)that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community, so as to sustain family and community ties,

(g)that it is desirable that children who commit offences accept responsibility for their actions and, wherever possible, make reparations for their actions,

(h)that, subject to the other principles described above, consideration should be given to the effect of any crime on the victim.""

127A contrary view has been forcefully expressed. In TG v R [2010] NSWCCA 28 the court had under consideration an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon a 17 ½ year old (at the time of the offences) in respect of four counts of dangerous driving causing death. It was clearly put in this Court that the sentences ought to be restructured in such a way as to ensure that the offender did not serve any part of his sentence in an adult prison. Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed said:

""24.Certainly no reduction in the sentence could be justified for the reasons put forward by [counsel] for the applicant. The suggestion that a sentence should, or could, be constructed with a view to bringing about a certain type of custodial arrangement should be firmly rejected. It is rarely, if ever, appropriate for a sentencing court to take into account administrative arrangements or executive decisions in determining the sentence to be imposed upon an offender. More importantly it would be quite wrong for a judge to seek to avoid a statutory prescription upon where a juvenile offender is to serve a sentence by reducing the sentence to avoid the administrative decision that a juvenile upon reaching the age of 21 is to be transferred to an adult prison.

25.This Court has stated consistently that the proper approach is to determine the appropriate sentence and then consider what, if any, options exist as to how that sentence is to be served. That approach was clearly stated in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. ... It would be unprincipled and an error of discretion for the court to reduce a sentence solely in an attempt to avoid a juvenile offender spending a period in custody in an adult facility."" (italics and bold added)

128It may be that the italicised sentence in [24] is stated rather too broadly. It is well established, for example, that the fact that an offender will serve his/her sentence in protective custody is a significantly relevant factor in the determination of the sentence to be imposed: see, for example, AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46; 198 CLR 111; R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [176] - [177]. The rationale for this approach is that a sentence served in protective custody is seen to be served under more onerous conditions.

129In recent times, the fact that a sentence will be served under protection has not automatically resulted in a reduction in sentence. That is because it can no longer be assumed that the sentence will be served under more onerous conditions. Where it is established, or accepted, that the conditions of the imprisonment will be more harsh than might otherwise be expected, a sentencing judge is entitled, and even expected, to reduce the sentence that might otherwise have been imposed.

130Here, I would be prepared to accept that a sentence to be served by a young man, with no prior experience in the criminal justice system, in an adult gaol, will operate more harshly upon him that a sentence to be served in a Juvenile Justice facility.

131That does, in my opinion, allow some moderation of the sentence for that reason. It cannot, however, be allowed to be the sole (see TG at [25]) determinant of the sentence to be imposed.

132For the reasons given above, I am satisfied that error has been shown under this ground, but it is not error that can be corrected as proposed by counsel. I will discuss below how correction can be achieved.

133The second part of the question (can the court tailor the sentence specifically for the purpose of imposing a sentence that will involve no time in adult custody) has to be answered with very considerably more caution. As Howie J said in TG, it would be an error for the court to select a sentence solely for the purpose of avoiding a period in adult custody. Whatever sentence is imposed, wherever it is to be served, must meet the prime sentencing objective of recognising the objective gravity of the crime. If that is achieved, however, I am of the view, consistently with the approach taken in respect of sentences served in protective custody, that some, although limited, weight can be given to the nature of the offender's custody.

134In reaching this view, I am conscious of the observations of the court (of which I was a member) in R v MD, BM, NA, JT [2005] NSWCCA 342 at [49] - [50], [54] - [56]. That is why I have expressed the caution I have.

Ground 2: manifest excess?

135The submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant under this ground focused upon two aspects of the sentencing. The first was the finding made by the sentencing judge that the objective gravity of the offence was below the mid-range of objective gravity ""but only just"". It was pointed out that, where the standard non-parole period does not apply, as in this case, such a finding is superfluous. However, the submission went on to contend that the finding led her Honour into error, because she then imposed a penalty appropriate to a case where the standard non-parole period applied as a guideline, and the offence fell within the mid-range.

136In my opinion there is some substance in this submission. Her Honour should not have allowed herself to be deflected into a consideration of the (irrelevant) standard non-parole period. That conclusion is fortified by the recent decision of the High Court in Muldrock v the Queen [2011] HCA 39, especially at [17] - [18].

137It is also of note that her Honour made no reference to s 6 of the Children (CP) Act.

138The second aspect of the sentencing of which criticism was directed was the treatment of the applicant's youth. I have already dealt with this under ground 1, but it is, of course, relevant to ground 2 as well.

139There is no doubt that, in this case, her Honour was confronted with a most difficult sentencing task. On the one hand, the principal offence could only be said to have been at an extreme level of seriousness, particularly having regard to the consequences to the victim. Were the applicant an adult, he could hardly have complained about the sentence. On the other hand, the principles applicable to the youth of the applicant had also to be taken into account. An additional factor, not identified by the sentencing judge, is that to which I have referred under ground 3, above. The nature of the applicant's custody is relevant. Even if this Court, on the limited material available, were to find special circumstances under s 19(3) of the Children (CP) Act, the applicant would still serve a minimum of 2 years and 5 months in adult custody. There was no evidence before the District Court, or before this Court, of the custodial options available to offenders such as the applicant.

140In my opinion the sentence imposed was one that might be expected to have been imposed upon an adult offender. Moreover, although her Honour referred (briefly) to the evidence of the applicant's exemplary conduct during almost two and a half years on bail, it seems to me that that is not reflected in the sentence. This was not a case in which rehabilitation assumed major significance, because, apart from this aberrant offence, the applicant had no criminal background or conduct against which to be rehabilitated. He was not to be penalised for that; the objects of sentencing laid out in s 6 of the Children (CP) Act called for greater attention to be given to his potential to be a contributing member of society.

141Notwithstanding the objective gravity of the offence, I have concluded that this ground also is made out.

142It will therefore be necessary to set aside the sentence and re-sentence the applicant.

143Against that possibility, the court received two affidavits, one affirmed by the applicant on 15 November 2011, and a second affirmed by his solicitor on the same date. The applicant recorded the circumstances of his custody. He said that he was initially held at the Riverina Juvenile Justice Centre, but in September 2011 was transferred to the Frank Baxter Juvenile Justice Centre, which the court was told is at Kariong on the central coast of NSW. He said he has been ""doing really well"" in custody, and gets along with all ""my inmates"". He has not had any internal charges or any trouble while in custody. He has been seeing a psychologist. He has had some medical problems. He has completed all courses available to him. In a paragraph I find somewhat disturbing, he said:

""7.I have completed all courses that have been offered to me at Riverina JJ and Frank Baxter JJ. I was going to school at Riverina JJ and Frank Baxter JJ I am attending school on days when people have pulled out. My name is on the waiting list to attend school permanently at Frank Baxter JJ.""

144The affidavit of the applicant's solicitor annexed documentary evidence of the various programmes undertaken, and reports of his conduct. On 21 September 2011, it was recorded that:

""[The applicant] is always a pleasure to have on any available programs and activities. [The applicant's] behaviour and personality has been consistently good.""

In another, a report of semester one of 2011 (presumably from Riverina) it was reported that:

""[The applicant] has been working diligently in his OTEN distance education studies. Last term he completed a certificate 1 in access to work and training, and is currently completing a certificate 1 in hospitality [the applicant] is able to complete his modules independently and also asks for assistance when needed. It is a credit to [the applicant] that he has been self-motivated to complete these studies to further his education.""

All reports were to similar effect. In another comment, dated 12 September 2011, it was said:

""[The applicant's] PLP [it is not clear what this means] indicates that he is a polite well-mannered student who is achieving well at school. His behaviour at school has been excellent and it is pleasing to see that he has the ability to work independently towards his TAFE studies.""

It is unnecessary to take further time restating the common theme.

145In the circumstances I have concluded that error has been shown and that it will be necessary to re-sentence the applicant. In determining what that sentence should be, I have particular regard to the highly impressive material tendered with respect to re-sentencing, as well as his pre-sentence conduct. The applicant has made good use of his time in custody, and has achieved such rehabilitation as is needed.

146For the purposes of s 19 of the Children (CP) Act, I would find special circumstances under subs (3), they being the applicant's vulnerability by reason of disability (Attention Deficit Disorder). I would therefore make an order directing that the whole of the non-parole period be served as a juvenile offender.

147 I would, in the interests of general deterrence, denunciation and retribution, maintain a lengthy head sentence. I would adopt the finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. I would not interfere with the sentence imposed in respect of the s 93C offence. I propose the following orders:

1.Leave to appeal granted;

2In respect of the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so, appeal allowed, sentence quashed;

3.In lieu thereof, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months, commencing on 14 October 2010, and concluding on 13 April 2016, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months, concluding on 14 July 2012;

4.Direct that the whole of the non-parole period be served as a juvenile offender.

148HOEBEN J: In this matter I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of Whealy JA and Simpson J. The facts are fully set out in the reasons of Simpson J.

149I agree for the reasons their Honours have set out, that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the lack of proportion between the sentence imposed on him and that imposed on ZBN, the other participant in the attack upon the victim (Ground 1). Accordingly, this Court must re-sentence the applicant.

150In relation to the ground of appeal asserting manifest excess in the sentence imposed, I agree with Whealy JA that this ground of appeal (Ground 2) should be rejected.

151I agree that the ground of appeal asserting a failure on the part of the sentencing judge to have adequate regard to the applicant's youth (Ground 4) should be rejected.

152In relation to the ground of appeal based on the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (Ground 3), I respectfully agree with Simpson J's analysis of the Act. I note that Whealy JA also agrees with this analysis. In that regard, Simpson J concluded that the applicant was ineligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after he had attained the age of 18 unless there were either special circumstances justifying his detention as a juvenile offender after that age or, in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period had been set, the non-parole period would end within six months after he had attained that age. Even where special circumstances were established, s19(2) of the Act would not permit an order to be made that went beyond the applicant's twenty first birthday.

153Where Whealy JA and Simpson J differ is in the application of ss19(4) and (4A). Those sections provide:

""(4) A finding of special circumstances for the purpose of subs ... (3) may be made on one or more of the following grounds, and not otherwise:

(a)That the person is vulnerable on account of illness or disability (within the meaning of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977),

(b)That the only available educational, vocational training or therapeutic programs that are suitable to the person's needs are those available in detention centres,

(c)That, if the person were committed to a correctional centre, there would be an unacceptable risk of the person suffering physical or psychological harm, whether due to the nature of the person's offence, any assistance given by the person in the prosecution of other persons or otherwise.

(4A)In particular, a finding of special circumstances may not be made simply because of a person's youth or simply because the non-parole period of the person's sentence will expire while the person is still eligible to serve a sentence as a juvenile offender.""

154Simpson J concluded that there was evidence before the sentencing judge such as would satisfy subs (4)(a) and that the sentencing judge erred in not taking that evidence into account. Whealy JA disagrees. On this issue, I agree with Whealy JA and am not satisfied that it was open to the sentencing judge to make a finding under subs (4)(a).

155In relation to the re-sentencing of the applicant, I agree with the sentence proposed by Whealy JA for the reasons his Honour has set out.

156While not strictly necessary, given my agreement with Whealy JA as to the re-sentencing of the applicant, I should say something about the possible tension between the remarks of Simpson J in her draft reasons and those of Howie J in TG v R [2010] NSWCCA 28 at [24] - [25]. On that issue I agree with the remarks of Whealy JA at [21] - [22] of his reasons.

157It follows that I agree with the orders proposed by Whealy JA.

2759199,"R v MASCALL, MASCALL and SEWELL [2012] NSWDC 176","SENTENCE

Introduction

1Paul and Lesley Mascall have been married for approaching 50 years. They have three children and six grandchildren. They have lived in Mona Vale for over 40 years and own their own home. Paul Mascall has spent almost all his working life in the air-conditioning business. He has had a very successful career. So has Lesley Mascall, as an administrative assistant in many companies over the years. She's found time to undertake voluntary work in the community for over 40 years. 

2And yet this couple, along with Paul Sewell, who was engaged in business with them, are now facing sentencing for serious offences against the Commonwealth Crimes Act. 

3How did this come about? It came about because they wanted to get access to profits generated by their business without having to pay income tax. They sought to relieve themselves of the legal obligation shared by all income earning Australians to pay tax on their earnings. Most people would probably welcome the chance not to pay income tax; it would make a substantial part of their income available for spending as they pleased. But most people acknowledge the obvious need for the government to levy income tax. It can provide essential services to us all as well as support those who have little or no income to be taxed. 

4In these remarks, I will first set out the charges and penalties that Paul and Lesley Mascall and Paul Sewell face. I will formally convict them of the crimes. Then I must give some more detail about the crimes they committed. Next, I will say something about their personal circumstances. Then I must refer to the principles of law that will guide me in sentencing them and then to the arguments for them and for the prosecution. Finally, I will sentence them. 

Charges, penalties and convictions

5The charges Paul and Lesley Mascall face are the same charges. Each of them has been charged with an offence against s 29D and s 86(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The charge is that between 1 July 1997 and about 23 May 2001 they conspired with each other and Lynette Liles to defraud the Commonwealth. Each of them has pleaded guilty to that charge. The second charge each of them faces is an offence against s 135.4(3) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). That charges that between about 24 May 2001 and 31 July 2004 they conspired with each and Lynette Liles to dishonestly cause a loss to the Commonwealth. 

6In addition, under s 16BA of the Crimes Act, each of them has admitted two other offences and wish those other offences to be taken into account by me in passing sentence on them in respect of the charges which I have already read out. Each of them has pleaded guilty to a further offence against s 29D and s 86(1) of the Crimes Act that between about 1 July 1997 and about 23 May 2001 they conspired with each other and Lynette Liles to defraud the Commonwealth. In addition, each of them has admitted their guilt to an offence against s 135.4(3) of the Criminal Code Act that between about 24 May 2001 and 31 July 2004 they conspired with each other and Lynette Liles to dishonestly cause a loss to the Commonwealth. 

7For reasons that will become apparent the offences that I am sentencing them for are relevant to the 'Air Solutions conspiracy' and the offences which I will take into account are related to the 'Varitech conspiracy'.

8The maximum penalty for the offences against s 29D and s 86(1) of the Crimes Act is 20 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the offences against s 135.4(3) of the Criminal Code Act is 10 years imprisonment. There is obviously a discrepancy between those two penalties and the higher Courts have indicated that, in effect, I regard the maximum for both offences as 10 years imprisonment and I do so. 

9I formally convict Lesley and Paul Mascall of each of the offence against s 29D and s 86(1) of the Crimes Act relating to the Air Solutions conspiracy, which I have read out, and the offences against s 135.4(3) of the Criminal Code Act related to the Air Solutions conspiracy, which I have read out. 

10Paul Sewell has pleaded guilty to one offence against s 29D of the Crimes Act, which charges that between about 16 December 2000 and 22 December 2000 he defrauded the Commonwealth, in that in his personal income tax return for the year ended 30 June 2000 he failed to include an amount of $23,754 as income, thereby dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage. He has also pleaded guilty to one other offence. That is an offence against s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act that between about 13 November 2001 and about 20 November 2003 he did, by a deception, dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from another person, namely the Commissioner of Taxation. That charge relates to the failure to include amounts of income in three income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 2001, 2002 and 2003. The respective amounts, corresponding to those years, are $10,450, $6,213 and $15,000. The charge included an allegation that he thereby dishonestly obtained a financial advantage.

11I formally convict Paul Sewell of both of those charges. 

12By way of explanation, the criminal activity of all of the offenders spanned a period during which the Commonwealth criminal law was amended. That explains why some of the charges are laid under the Crimes Act and some of the charges are laid under the Criminal Code Act, the relevant part of which became effective on 24 May 2011. 

The criminal activity

13Now I must give a little more detail about the criminal activity which these offenders engaged in and which led to the charges. 

14What is called the 'Air Solutions conspiracy' is conveniently and concisely summarised in the statement of agreed facts contained in exhibit A. Over pages 3 and 4 the following is recorded - 

""Between about 1 July 1997 and about 31 July 2005, a tax evasion scheme was operated by some of the directors of Air Solutions."" 

HIS HONOUR: I mention here the reference to Air Solutions is to Air Solutions International Pty Limited. I return to quoting from exhibit A, 

""Air Solutions directors were Paul Mascall, Lesley Mascall, Hamish James McLean, Paul Singleton Sewell and Christopher Chalinor. Each director was also a shareholder of Air Solutions. Lynette Kathleen Liles was Air Solutions' accountant. She was the promoter of the tax evasion scheme and assisted Paul and Lesley Mascall to incorporate a company in Vanuatu and put the scheme into effect. The scheme involved the following steps:

- money was transferred out of Air Solutions, purportedly for payment of expenses incurred, to a bank account in Vanuatu named 'ZAX International Corporation', which was controlled by Paul and Lesley Mascall;

- false expenses claims were made in Air Solutions' company accounts, thereby reducing Air Solutions' taxable income and evading the payment at company income tax;

- money removed from Air Solutions was returned to that company's shareholders, Paul Mascall, Lesley Mascall, Hi-Tech Property Services Pty Ltd, McLean and Sewell in proportion to their shareholdings;

- the money received by the shareholders was not declared income in the company income tax return of Hi-Tech, or the personal income tax returns of McLean and Sewell; and

- the money received by Paul and Lesley Mascall either as a result of their shareholding in Hi-Tech, or as the persons who exercised control of the Vanuatu bank accounts, was not declared in their personal income tax returns. 

Between June 1998 and April 2003, $689,684 was sent from Air Solutions to ZAX. Between June 2000 and May 2003, $630,000 was distributed from the ZAX bank account to the shareholders of Air Solutions. The shareholders then repatriated their funds to Australia by transfers to bank accounts in Australia or by withdrawal of funds from automatic teller machines in Australia.""

15I should add that Hi-Tech Property Services Pty Limited was controlled by Paul and Lesley Mascall, who used it as their investment company. Hi-Tech was, at all relevant times, the majority shareholder in Air Solutions. 

16There was a second course of criminal behaviour, which is the subject of the charges on the schedule for Paul and Lesley Mascall and which is called the 'Varitech conspiracy'. Varitech is a reference to a company called Varitech Pty Limited. I take this summary from pages 34 to 35 of the agreed statement of facts in exhibit A - 

""Paul Mascall and Lesley Mascall, after receiving advice from Liles, commenced a tax evasion scheme involving Varitech. The scheme was similar to that operated through Air Solutions. However, as Varitech was a smaller company with less profit, there were only 6 distributions of Varitech's profits via Vanuatu to its shareholders. 

Varitech Pty Limited was incorporated on 3 July 1995. Varitech's directors at incorporation were Paul William Earnest Mascall and Iven Lockhart Muir. Lesley Ann Mascall and Caroline Bernadette Muir were appointed directors on 7 September 1999. 

Varitech issued 2 shares. One share was jointly held by Muir and Caroline Muir. The other share was held by Hi-Tech Property Services Pty Ltd. 

Varitech's business was the supply of specialised air conditioning equipment with Paul Mascall responsible for distribution in New South Wales and Muir responsible for distribution in Victoria. 

Lesley Mascall was the bookkeeper for Varitech and was responsible for maintaining Varitech's accounts. She provided information regarding Varitech's accounts to Veale & Co, who prepared the yearly financial accounts and income tax returns for Varitech. 

Paul and Lesley Mascall's personal income returns were prepared by Lynette Kathleen Liles. 

A total of $210,000 was transferred from Varitech to ZAX and to Pacific Hurricane in six transfers between 13 June 2000 and 31 March 2004. 

Between 16 June 2011 and May 2004, Iven and Caroline Muir received six transfers of funds from Vanuatu totalling $104,612. 

During the same period, $105,144.96 was retained in Vanuatu in bank accounts over which Paul and Lesley Mascall had control.""

Personal circumstances 

17Mr A J Payne SC and Ms P M Wass, who appeared in the sentence proceedings for Mr and Mrs Mascall and Mr Sewell, helpfully set out in their written submissions (which be came MFI 4) information personal to their clients which, along with the details of the crimes, is important for a judge to take into account in sentencing offenders. Once again it is convenient to quote from pages 9 to 11 of those written submissions - 

""Paul Mascall is 71 and was born on 18 September 1940 in London. He is an only child. He and his parents emigrated in 1952 to Sydney. He attended North Sydney Boys High School and obtained the Leaving Certificate. 

He studied engineering (as his father had done). He went to Sydney Technical College and obtained a Mechanical Engineering Certificate. With further study, this was later converted to a Diploma. Paul Mascall has for approximately 10 years been the Treasurer of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. 

He has always worked. He undertook a number of drafting jobs with Star Machinery and later Van Gelder, where he worked as a Senior Draftsman. Later in sales engineering work at R Werner & Co (later Email Air), where he worked on cooling towers in the 1960s. He then worked with Carrier Air Conditioning. Later, he returned to Email Air in a more senior role. In the early 1970s he returned to Carrier and worked in the NSW Division as the Senior Sales Engineer and later as the NSW Sales Manager. In about 1977 - 1978 Paul was offered the role of Area Manager in Hong Kong. Lesley and Paul Mascall lived in Hong Kong for about 2 years. Paul and Lesley then returned to Australia and Paul worked for Carrier as National Sales Manager. He worked in that role for about 2-3 years until the early 1980s. In early to mid 1980s he was employed by F Muller as Marketing Manager. He then left to set up a small distribution business, Australian Air Filters and built it to a successful business. In the late 1980s he was asked to join Talbot Street & Associates as a Partner, a service company, servicing airconditioning plants. 

Paul Mascall then started Hi-Tech Property Services and he built the company up from 1992 to 1996 with airconditioning products. A product he sold was marketed and produced by Dunn Air Conditioning (a national company). From 1992 to 1996, Paul ran Dunn Air Conditioning (NSW) Pty Limited and then built the business. In 1996, Robert Dunn sold his share in the company and the company was renamed Air Solutions. At that time Sewell and McLean, and later Chalinor, bought into the company. 

In 1992 he undertook at Macquarie University a Diploma in Business. He later transferred and completed his MBA in about 1992. 

He works diligently in his church. 

Lesley and Paul Mascall met in about 1958. They married in 1965. They have 3 children: Sheridan (born 1966), Peta (born 1968) and Nicholas (born 1972). They have 6 grandchildren. 

In 1968 they moved to Mona Vale, where they currently reside. They own their own home. 

The Mascalls met Liles (then McPhee) in the 1980s. A mutual colleague introduced them and recommended her. For the next few decades, until this matter, she was their accountant. The Mascalls had no problems with the ATO in the many years prior to this matter and they trusted her implicitly as a friend and adviser.""

18In respect of Lesley Mascall the submissions say this - 

""Lesley Mascall was born in Waverley, Sydney on 30 May 1943. She is 68 years of age. 

She attended Waverley Primary School, later Huntingtower School in Mt Waverley and finally Roseville Girls School. She left school at 15. 

That year she met Paul Mascall. She attended Hales Secretarial College in Sydney. She has always worked in an administrative/secretarial position and her past employers includes, JFK & Co Chartered Accountants, Scott Outboard Motors, H Poole & Co, Jacaranda Press and Weldon Publishing. 

She has performed voluntary work in the community for about 40 years. She has worked as a Sunday School teacher and in a community bookshop. She supports six children via World Vision. She is a member of Kiva, where she lends money to people in developing communities. She lends to six people at any one time. She also gives willingly to many charities from time to time. She works as a silversmith and artisan. In addition, she works in her Church community with counselling services.""

19In respect of Mr Sewell, the submissions say the following - 

""Mr Sewell was born on 11 May 1955 in Canterbury. He is 56 years of age. He lived in Condell Park until he was 8 and later moved to Loftus. 

He left school after year 10 and joined the Royal Australian Navy at the age of 15 as an engine room maintenance mechanic. He performed those duties for about 7 years. 

Sewell then went to Adelaide and worked as an air conditioning mechanic for about 2 years. 

In about 1979, he worked at Alexandria Budge-Ellis Coop Limited (a division of Dairy Farmers) as a production planner, allocating workshop jobs and later in sales, selling cooling towers. He did this for about 7 years. Sewell then worked for Summit Refrigeration Products as a sales and manufacturing supervisor for about 12 months. In about 1986 he worked for Newarra Air Conditioning in Bankstown as a salesman. 

In July 1992 he joined Dunn Air Conditioning (Pty Ltd), later Air Solutions. 

Sewell is not married, having divorced in about 1987. He has no children. 

He has been living with his current partner for the last 20 years. They reside in a rented house at Mortlake. He is a regular donor to charities, particularly for cancer as both he and his partner's parents died of cancer."" 

20In addition, there has been provided to me in the form of exhibit 1, a folder of material regarding each of the offenders. There is in each case a psychological report, a medical report and a probation and parole report. Those reports, compared to what a judge often reads in sentencing cases, are relatively unremarkable. 

21What is remarkable and more significant are the character references. Each of the offenders is obviously very highly regarded within the community. 

22Descriptions for Mr Mascall include ""honest and hard working"", ""professional and diligent"" and ""completely trustworthy."" One person said that there was ""zero chance of him reoffending"" and that the offences were ""totally out of character for him."" His business and private life were conducted with integrity.

23In respect of Lesley Mascall, descriptions of her refer to a person who has progressed to ""greater compassion, caring and interested in others"", and the offences have been described as ""completely against her character and nature and completely contrary to anything I had previously known about her."" She is described in terms of ""honest and in no way greedy."" She is described as a ""trustworthy and honourable person."" 

24In respect of Mr Sewell, references about him describe him as a person who is ""always ready and willing to help"" and that ""he would avoid allowing himself to be placed in a similar position any time in the future."" He is described as ""honest and diligent"" and ""well-respected within his community."" He is regarded as ""most helpful and supportive"" and ""very professional."" He is also described as ""competent and ethical."" 

25It is important to record that I have read those references and I will take them into account when I come to sentence each of the offenders.

Guiding principles of law

26I now come to referring to the principles of law that will guide me in sentencing each of the offenders. I have had considerable assistance from senior counsel and counsel for the offenders as well as from Mr D Lee of counsel who appeared in the sentence proceedings for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.

27A number of the authorities referred to concerned similar crimes in that they were about offenders who were engaged in tax evasion through Vanuatu. One of those cases was determined by the High Court. It was Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, (2010) 242 CLR 520.

28An important consideration in sentencing federal offenders is consistency. At page 527 ([18]) of Hili and Jones French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ said the following - 

""Consistency in sentencing federal offenders is achieved by the proper application of the relevant statutory provisions, having proper regard not just to what has been done in other cases but why it was done, and by the work of the intermediate courts of appeal."" 

Their Honours went on to say at page 536 ([50]) - 

""The first and paramount means of achieving consistency in federal sentencing is to apply the relevant statutory provisions."" 

Their Honours had earlier said at 528 ([24]) - 

""Chief among the principles stated in Div 2 is that provided by s 16A(1): that ""[i]n determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence."" 

29Their Honours also described at 540 ([63]) the offending behaviour in that case which also is an apt description in many ways of offending behaviour in this case - 

""The applicants' offending was sustained over a long time. It was planned, deliberate and deceitful, requiring for its implementation the telling of many lies. The applicants acted out of personal greed. The amount of tax evaded was not small. Detection of offending of this kind is not easy. Serious tax fraud, which this was, is offending that affects the whole community. As was pointed out in R v Ruha (2010), 198 A Crim R 430 at 443 ([45]), the sentences imposed had to have both a deterrent and a punitive effect, and those effects had to be reflected in the head sentences and the recognisance release orders that were made."" 

30There are a number of decisions of the intermediate courts of appeal - namely, the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal and Court of Appeal as well as the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal - to which I have been referred and which contain some statements of principle. 

31In Regina v Morris (1992) 61 A Crim R 233, a decision of Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, the Court (comprising Phillips CJ, Crockett and Southwell JJ) said the following over pages 238-239 - 

""In our opinion the critical consideration is that taxpayers cannot be permitted to defraud the revenue in the belief that detection can lead to no more than a requirement merely to make financial reparation and to pay a monetary penalty so as to enable the offender to 'purchase' immunity from prosecution under the criminal law."" 

At 240 their Honours said in a passage which has been referred to and relied upon over the years since, the following - 

""It is clear that in recent years the trend has been towards the imposition of custodial sentences even upon first offenders (which most of such offenders seem to be) in the absence of substantial mitigating circumstances."" 

32A few years later the Victorian Court of Appeal in Regina v Nguyen and Phan (1996) 86 A Crim R 521, Brooking JA with whom Winneke P and Callaway JA said at 525 the following - 

""The seriousness of the offence of defrauding the Commonwealth of a large sum of money by not declaring assessable income has in the past, perhaps, not always been sufficiently reflected in the sentence passed. Those who is systematically defraud the Revenue of a large sum over a substantial period must in general expect a substantial custodial sentence. The deterrent and punitive effect of that sentence should not be unduly diminished by allowing release from custody at an unduly early stage."" 

33I should have added - when I was referring to the passage from [63] of the High Court's judgment in Hili and Jones - that I acknowledge that the amount of tax evaded in that case was more than the amount of tax evaded in this case. 

34One thing which is clear from the passages which I have quoted is the emphasis which the intermediate courts of appeal place on the principle of general deterrence so far as these kinds of offences are concerned. 

35The other decision which has been drawn to my attention is the recent decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Boughen and Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17. Simpson J delivered the judgment of the Court and Hislop and Latham JJ agreed. Once again, the fraud on the revenue in that case involved companies based in Vanuatu. Simpson J at [8] described the scheme in terms which appropriately apply to this case. Her Honour said - 

""The accountant introduced the respondents to a scheme that was no more and no less than a relatively simple income tax evasion scheme."" 

Her Honour quoted at [67] from a decision again of the Victorian Court of Appeal in DPP (Cth) v Goldberg [2001] VSCA 107 at [51]. Her Honour quoted a passage from Vincent JA's judgment where his Honour had said - 

""The maintenance and integrity of the revenue collection systems, upon which the administration of government and the provision of a wide range of necessary services to the community are dependant, is vitally important to the proper functioning of our society."" 

Simpson J in the following paragraph referred to another passage from Vincent JA's judgment where his Honour cited with approval remarks of the sentencing judge in Goldberg. Those remarks were as follows - 

""Tax evasion is not a game, or a victimless crime. It is a form of corruption and is, therefore, insidious. In the case of brazen tax evasion, honest citizens begin to doubt their own value and are tempted to do what they see others do with apparent impunity. At the very least, they are left the legitimate sense of grievance, which is itself divisive. Tax evasion is not simply a matter of failing to pay one's debt to the government. It is theft, and tax evaders are thieves."" 

36Once again in Boughen and Cameron I acknowledge that the amounts involved in tax evasion were greater than the amounts involved in this case. Nevertheless, it is important to note that at [93] Simpson J referred to two features of the offence in that case which her Honour said ""strongly suggest more, rather than less, severe sentences. These are the period of time - seven years - over which they continued, and the amounts involved."" The period of time in this case, so far as Mr and Mrs Mascall are concerned, is about the same. 

37At [96] her Honour addressed the question of apparent disparity between sentences imposed upon apparently well-to-do respectable citizens and sentences imposed upon other members of the community who depend upon welfare services and perpetrate fraud upon the social security system. I quote - 

""There is undoubtedly a pathos about the prospect of two middle aged men, of prior good, even exemplary, character, each with some health issues, who have expressed remorse for their conduct, being sentenced to imprisonment. That pathos cannot be permitted to overshadow the objective seriousness of the offences: two middle aged men, intelligent, professionally successful, financially secure, prosperous, over a seven year period defrauded the Australian community of very significant sums of money, leaving others, less financially able to do so, to bear the burden of financing the many services government provides. The community cannot afford to be squeamish about discharging their duty, however personally painful it may sometimes be. To fail to sentence middle class offenders commensurately with social security offenders risks bringing the administration of justice into disrepute as perpetrating class bias."" 

Arguments

38The offenders' counsel and counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions correctly addressed the statutory regime which applies to me in sentencing for federal offences. That scheme is contained, as the High Court said, in Div 2 of Part 1B of the Crimes Act, in particular s 16A. In particular, as the High Court says, I must put emphasis on s 16A(1) which requires me to ""impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"". 

39I must take into account in accordance with s 16A(2)(a), also ""the nature and the circumstances of offence."" The offenders' senior counsel, in oral submissions, emphasised the leading role of the accountant. He accepted that Mr Mascall is ""the next most culpable."" But Mr Payne SC argued that there was ""very little differentiation of any substance"" between his client Lesley Mascall and Mr McLean. 

40Mr McLean, it is important to record, has already been sentenced by his Honour Judge Freeman, a former judge of this Court. Mr McLean was involved in the same fraud. Mr McLean faced one offence of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception from the Commissioner of Taxation against section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act. It carried a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. The amount involved in Mr McLean's case was about $66,500. He had pleaded guilty. He, too, was a director of Air Solutions. He was for some time also the managing director of Air Solutions. He was prosecuted for failing to declare the distributions which he received for income tax returns covering the years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. His Honour sentenced Mr McLean to 3 years imprisonment. But his Honour directed that Mr McLean be released forthwith upon entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for 3 years. 

41Mr Payne SC put much emphasis upon the principle of parity and the relevance of the sentence imposed upon Mr McLean to the sentences which I will need to impose upon Mr Sewell in particular, and also on Mrs Mascall.

42Mr Payne SC and Ms Wass in their written submissions referred to correspondence from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions dated 3 November 2011 which contained the following concessions - 

""(1) The Crown considers Mr Sewell's culpability for the offences is less than that of Mr McLean; 

(2) The Crown does not intend to appeal the sentence given to Mr McLean; and 

(3) The reason Mr Sewell faces two charges is a result of the commencement of chapter 7 of the Criminal Code Act (Cth) on 24 May 2011. But for the change in legislation, Mr Sewell would have been offered the ability to plead guilty to one substantive offence, as was the case with Mr McLean.""

Hence Mr Payne SC's submission that there was ""little differentiation of any substance"" between Ms Mascall and Mr McLean. 

43However, Mr Payne SC also realistically acknowledged that the offending behaviour of Lesley Mascall is more serious because it extended over a longer period of time. Her offending extended over some 7 years, whereas Mr McLean's extended over some 4 years. In addition, as a result of her greater shareholding Mrs Mascall obtained a greater sum of money. The amount of money involved, so far as Mrs Mascall was concerned, resulted in a tax shortfall for her personally of $166,000, whereas Mr McLean's tax shortfall was about $100,000 less than that. In addition Mrs Mascall accompanied Mr Mascall to Vanuatu to make arrangements for various procedures that had to be set up over there. 

44On the other hand, of course, as Mr Payne SC pointed out, Mr McLean was Managing Director of Air Solutions and involved in its day-to-day financial affairs. He also provided false information to the Australian Taxation Office. However, another factor which I will come to - and which is important to take into account in Lesley Mascall's case - is that I am taking into account in sentencing her the offences related to the 'Varitech conspiracy'. 

45I take into account under s 16A(2)(c) the fact that the offending behaviour formed part of a course of conduct consisting of a serious of similar acts of the same character. That I take into account in respect to all three offenders. As was correctly described by Mr Lee, in his written submissions, the offending behaviour was ""lengthy, persistent and calculated"". 

46Under s 16A(2)(e) I must take into account ""any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence"". The loss to the revenue in respect of Mr Paul Mascall was over $174,000 and, as I have said, just over $166,000 in respect of Lesley Mascall. For Air Solutions the loss was just over $450,000 and for Varitech the loss was nearly $65,000. In Mr Sewell's case the loss was over $25,000. It must be borne in mind that the Mascalls own 62 per cent of Air Solutions and 50 per cent of Varitech. All tax penalties and interest have been paid by Air Solutions and by Varitech. All tax penalties and interest have been paid by Mr Sewell. A deed of settlement has been entered into between the Mascalls and the Australian Taxation Office so far as their personal income tax is concerned and I sentence them upon the basis that that in effect means that it has been repaid. I acknowledge, as Mr Payne SC pointed out, that interest and penalty charges include a significant punitive element. 

47These steps also show a good deal of contrition and remorse, which is relevant to s 16A(2)(f). All of the offenders are remorseful and prepared to facilitate the course of justice, which is obvious by their pleas of guilty, which I take into account. On the one hand these pleas of guilty were entered into in the face of a very strong prosecution case. They were, to some extent in my opinion, acknowledging the inevitable. On the other hand, as Mr Payne SC argues, the legal proposition regarding liability for the tax was arguable and ""an extremely long and complicated trial would have been pursued"". I would be prepared to discount the sentences which I would otherwise impose by 20 per cent for each offender because of their pleas of guilty. 

48I also take into account, in general terms, the fact that all of the offenders cooperated with the authorities in the investigation of the offences. The cooperation was quite active. They retained an experienced accountant, whose report I have read and taken into account and which was part of exhibit 1. The accountant was Mr Dennis Robertson. He was retained ""to rectify their taxation affairs, not knowing whether or not they would be charged with any offences"". They offered to assist in the prosecution of Ms Liles, however their evidence was not needed. So far as that assistance is concerned the authorities suggest that it is the practical value and the actual benefit which is more important to give weight to. 

49All three of the offenders, as I have already said, are persons of good character and I have taken into account a significant number of character references, which have been provided. None of them has a criminal record. 

50I agree that there is no reason why each of the offenders would not have excellent prospects of rehabilitation. 

51It is very important that I take into account the deterrent effect of sentencing of others who may consider such crimes. However, I do not think the offenders in this case require much personal deterrence. I doubt whether any of them would consider entering into such schemes in the future. 

52Although the sentences will obviously have an impact on the offenders' families, I will take that into account as a general subjective factor rather than a specific mitigating factor because the extent of the hardship will be no greater to other families of other offenders who have committed other crimes. 

53I should make some reference to Mr Payne SC's reliance on what he described as nine factors, which he said were very important for me to take into account. Many of them I have already referred to. The nine factors were: parity, the amount of tax and shares in Air Solutions, the cooperation with the Australian Taxation Office, the repayment of the tax and the fact that penalties have been paid, the delay in prosecution, the pleas of guilty, the offers of assistance and various other factors including the offenders' age and the fact that they had relied upon their tax adviser. 

54The amount of the tax short fall was roughly about a third of that in Boughen and Cameron. All of the offenders have offered what is obviously a sincere apology. I take into account their cooperation and I take into account that the Mascalls corrected, on the advice of Mr Robertson, an error by the Australian Taxation Office which resulted in them paying an additional $100,000 in reparation. That shows the obvious contrition. 

55I do take into account that there has been a good amount of delay in the charges coming to this stage of the sentencing. The conduct the subject of the charges was completed by 30 June 2005. A tax audit was completed by December 2006. Amended assessments were issued in mid 2007. The offenders were not charged until December 2008 and they appeared in the Local Court early the following year. They entered their pleas in November 2011. I have taken into account what Mr Payne SC and Ms Wass have said in their written submissions about the delay. There has been a significant delay, although I also take into account that in a case such as this there is a need for a good deal of preparation so far as the authorities are concerned. The trial would have been complex and that is one reason why I will discount the sentences I would otherwise impose by some 20 per cent. 

56I also take into account the fact that all of them relied upon the advice given by the tax agent, Ms Liles, in entering into this scheme. 

57So far as parity is concerned, I regard Lesley Mascall as being in a more serious category than Mr McLean. This is because the period of her offending was longer and the tax shortfall was greater. In addition, of course, - which is not directly related to parity - I am taking into account an additional offence in sentencing her. 

58Finally, before turning to sentencing the offenders I must deal with a submission made by Mr Payne SC regarding the question of whether I take into account the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal's decision in a guideline judgment concerning additional offences under the New South Wales sentencing regime. The decision is called Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518, (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. 

59Mr Payne SC and Ms Wass referred to a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Nguyen and Phan (1996) 86 A Crim R 521 which they argued held ""without elaboration, that when taking into account on sentence offences under s 16BA Crimes Act, it is necessary for a sentencing court to comply with the general principles applicable to the New South Wales regime for taking offences into account."" Counsel ""respectfully submitted that this finding is unsound, having regard to the High Court's decision in Hili and Jones. That is, s 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) is not engaged in s 16BA sentencing of a federal offender."" They argue that ""care should be taken"" in applying ""the exposition of principles"" in the New South Wales guideline judgment. 

60There is, in my opinion, some force in that submission. The High Court had said in Hili and Jones at 527 ([21]), ""to the extent to which Part 1B of the Crimes Act otherwise provides, State and Territory laws in relation to the sentencing of offenders are not picked up"". Part 1B does ""otherwise provide"" by s 16BA. But that is because of what Gummow and Hayden JJ had said in Putlan v The Queen (2004) HCA 8; 218 CLR 174 at 189 ([41]), referring to the Judiciary Act - 

""[Section] 68(1) was to be read in the sense it would have if, as a matter of express statement rather than implication, there was a qualification for provision otherwise made from time to time by the laws of the Commonwealth. That understanding should be accepted.""

61However, on the other hand, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal - which binds me - regards its own guideline judgment as applying in sentencing federal offences. That is apparent from Nguyen and Phan, which was referred to by the offenders' counsel and also in R v Dennison [2011] NSWCCA 114, which was decided after the High Court's decision in Hili and Jones. 

62In my opinion, a comparison of the two statutory regimes demonstrates that they are substantially similar. Therefore, in my opinion, the reasoning - including the references to the rationale in taking into account other offences (which appears at [62] - [64] of Attorney General's Application) and to the elements to which weight is to be given (which is referred to at [42]) - is applicable. I therefore propose to take into account the guideline judgment in Attorney General's Application in sentencing these offenders. 

63I also bear in mind what the High Court has said about fixing a non-parole period for federal offences by reference to what the High Court in Powell v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623; [1974] HCA 26, Deakin v The Queen (1984) 58 ALJR 367; [1984] HCA 31 and Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525; [1990] HCA 18. 

Sentences

64I now come to imposing sentences on the offenders. In respect of Mr Paul Mascall I would regard an overall sentence - covering both offences and taking into account the other offences - of 5 years imprisonment as being appropriate. I would discount that by 20 per cent so that the appropriate sentence, in my opinion, would be 4 years imprisonment. I would set a non-parole period of 2 years imprisonment. 

65For Lesley Mascall I would regard an overall sentence of 3 years and 9 months as being appropriate. I would discount that by 20 per cent so that I would regard a sentence of 3 years imprisonment as the appropriate sentence. I do not regard it as appropriate that Lesley Mascall be released forthwith and I regard an appropriate non-parole period for her as being 15 months imprisonment. 

66For Paul Sewell, I regard an appropriate sentence as being 3 years imprisonment. I would discount that by 20 per cent to 28 months or 2 years imprisonment. In due course, because of the principle of parity and the concessions made the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions I will direct his release forthwith. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Williams and Ms Wass, I will formally sentence the offenders in a moment and I have indicated what the sentences will be. It seems to me that what I would do for Mr Paul Mascall - his overall sentence is 4 years - is to sentence him to 2 consecutive periods of 2 years and 2 consecutive non-parole periods of 1 year. Similarly with Mrs Mascall, 2 consecutive periods of 1½ years and 2 consecutive periods of 7 months and 8 months. Is that going to work? Do you ask for non-parole periods? 

WILLIAMS: The effect of the head sentence for a non-parole period must exceed 3 years. Your Honour has split them down the middle so it would be a recognisance release order that your Honour would have to make. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, recognisance release orders. 

WILLIAMS: There is one further matter.

HIS HONOUR: So far as you are concerned, Mr Williams, doing it that way 2 plus 2, 1 plus 1 with a recognisance release orders. 

WILLIAMS: There will be one recognisance release order. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes and I can do that, can I, one recognisance release order for the two? 

WILLIAMS: For the two head sentences that's so. 

HIS HONOUR: I will do the same for Mrs Lesley Mascall. I will direct Mr Sewell's release forthwith. There is only one crime for him forthwith. Three years under a recognisance release order for him? 

WILLIAMS: I understand your Honour that-

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, his sentence is 2 years under a recognisance release order.

WILLIAMS: Yes, technically speaking, your Honour, given that there are 2 charges in respect of Mr Sewell.

HIS HONOUR: You are quite right. You are right, I am sorry. That needs to be 1 plus 1. 

WILLIAMS: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: A recognisance release order forthwith.

WILLIAMS: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Wass, have you got anything to add?

WASS: I don't wish to be heard on that.

HIS HONOUR: What's the section, Mr Williams for the recognisance release order.

WILLIAMS: Section 20(1)(b). I have a proforma order if that would assist. It is a fill in the blanks type of thing.

HIS HONOUR: I would rather do it from the statute. Subsection 1(b), what sort of security or is it without security? 

WILLIAMS: A notional amount of $1000 or $500.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Without surety, I think.

WILLIAMS: That's acceptable, your Honour

HIS HONOUR: By recognizance?

WILLIAMS: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. 

67Mr Paul Mascall, stand up, please, sir. In respect of the offence under s 29D of the Crimes Act of conspiring with Lesley Mascall and Lynette Liles to defraud the Commonwealth and taking into account the other offence under the same provision of conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth, I sentence you to 2 years imprisonment to commence today and to conclude on 10 May 2014. In respect of the offence against s 135.4 of the Criminal Code Act, that you conspired with each other and Lynette Liles to dishonestly cause a loss to the Commonwealth, taking into account the other offence under the same section, I sentence you to 2 years imprisonment to commence on 11 May 2014 and to expire on 10 May 2016. Under s 20(1) of the Crimes Act upon you giving security in the sum of $500 without surety and by recognizance I direct by this order that you be released after serving 2 years of imprisonment and that your release be on 10 May 2014.

68Mrs Mascall, in respect of the offence under s 29D and s 86 of the Crimes Act, that you conspired with Paul Mascall and Lynette Liles to defraud the Commonwealth, taking into account another offence under the same provision, I sentence you to 1 year and 6 months imprisonment to commence today 11 May 2012 and to expire on 10 November 2013. In respect of the offence under s 135.4 of the Criminal Code Act, that you with Paul Mascall, conspired with Lynette Liles to dishonestly cause a loss to the Commonwealth and taking into account the other offence against the same provision, I sentence you to 1 year and 6 months imprisonment to commence on 11 November 2013 and to expire on 10 May 2015. Under s 20(1) of the Crimes Act, I direct by order that you be released upon giving security of $500 by recognizance and without surety after you have served a period of 15 months imprisonment and that you be released on 10 November 2013.

69Mr Sewell, in respect of the offence against s 29D of the Crimes Act, that you defrauded the Commonwealth, I sentence you to 1 year imprisonment to commence today 11 May 2012 and to expire on 10 May 2013. In respect of the offence against s 134.2 of the Criminal Code Act, that by a deception you dishonestly obtained an advantage from the Commissioner of Taxation, I sentence you to 1 year imprisonment to commence on 11 May 2013 and to expire on 10 May 2014. Under s 20(1), I direct by order that you be released upon giving security in the sum of $500 without surety by recognizance forthwith.

HIS HONOUR: In a moment I will discharge my obligation to explain the sentences to the offenders. Mr Williams and Ms Wass, I will ask you first, whether I have the figures correct, the mathematics, so to speak. I don't say that lightly because what I am doing is imposing periods of years, so it needs to be right and the second thing is whether there are any factual legal errors that might be dealt with now rather than at a later time, if that is possible. Mr Williams?

WILLIAMS: Your Honour, the technical aspects of the sentence are fine. 

HIS HONOUR: Mathematics work out, so far as you're concerned? 

WILLIAMS: Yes, thank you. There was a further matter that I wish to raise with your Honour. In relation to Mr Sewell, the Crown seeks a fingerprint order pursuant to s 3ZL of the Crimes Act. The reason that is requested is that these proceedings were commenced by way of court attendance notice. None the offenders were processed through a police station, none of their fingerprints are on record at this stage. Obviously it is only applicable to Mr Sewell that I will seek the order. My submission is that it is appropriate to do so. It is a serious offence and it should be properly recorded on his history and a further reason for the taking of the fingerprints your Honour is that in effect ensures the integrity of the police database of criminal histories. If there is duplicate names, the database can be sure that the offence that Mr Sewell is convicted of today is attached to the right profile. That is my submission. 

WASS: Your Honour, an order under s 3ZL is discretionary. In my submission in cases such as these they are awarded in two circumstances; one, where no issue is taken and very often done by consent, but also where, for example, in social security matters there are problems such as false names, also done in cases, Commonwealth matters such as passport matters where, again, false names are used and there's some issue about the use of a name. In this circumstance it does not arise. The full name and date of birth would suffice for records and taking of fingerprints adds a further imposition on Mr Sewell which is not warranted in all the circumstances of this case. 

HIS HONOUR: Have your other clients? 

WASS: They will, I think, be fingerprinted because they go into custody but they have not been otherwise, had their fingerprints taken. In my submission, the integrity of the database is not a valid submission where often in tax matters and tax offences they're dealt with in the Local Court, the fingerprints are never taken and in my submission it is simply not appropriate in your Honour's discretion to order that in this case. 

HIS HONOUR: I won't make the order. 

70I decline to make the order sought. 

HIS HONOUR: What else? Ms Wass, the mathematics, the beginnings and ends? 

WASS: They seem fine, and to the extent I have been able to absorb your Honour's reasons as we sit here, I don't have anything I wish to raise. 

HIS HONOUR: Just in case there was some obvious thing I made a mistake in, that could be corrected here. 

WASS: No, there wasn't, to me as I stand here. 

WILLIAMS: Nothing further, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay. I have signed MFI 1 and 2 which are the forms under s16BA. They will go on the respective court file. 

WASS: Your Honour, I apologise, I had written 15. I can't add, it seems. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, the sums were wrong. I intended to sentence Mrs Mascall to 15 months as the period in the form of release and wrongly specified 10 November 2013 and that should have been 10 August; does that sound right? 

WASS: It does.

71So, Mrs Mascall, the direction in your case that you be released on 10 August 2013, that is after 15 months, not 18 months; so it is 15 months. Release date 10 August 2013. 

HIS HONOUR: I don't think there are any other formalities? 

WASS: One matter, Mr Sewell obviously needs to sign his recognizance release order. 

HIS HONOUR: I gather he goes to the Downing Centre to do that. My associate has the paperwork. I will mention the other matter, go off the Bench, review the orders, sign them and my associate will scan them and send them to the Registry or fax them, one or the other, so they'll be there when he goes down. Thank you. Mrs Mascall can be taken down.

		08 October 2012",2012-05-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2759222,"Hudson v Director-General, Department of Environment Climate Change and Water [2012] NSWCCA 92","Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: By a summons filed on 26 February 2008 the appellant was charged with an offence under s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (""the Act"") in that he authorised the carrying out of clearing of native vegetation other than in accordance with a development consent granted in accordance with the Act, or a property vegetation plan. The particulars to the summons indicated that the place of the offence was a property, ""Yarrol"", in the Moree Plains Local Government Area. It indicated that the native vegetation cleared (to use its common name) included Coolibah, Belah and River Cooba trees.

2By a summons filed on 24 June 2008, the appellant was charged with a contravention of s 36(4) of the Act in that, without reasonable excuse, he failed to comply with a notice issued under s 36(2) of the Act to the extent he was capable of complying with it. Section 36 of the Act empowers the respondent to seek information about a possible contravention of the Act and obliges a person to supply the requested information. A failure to supply such information without reasonable excuse is an offence under s 36(4) of the Act.

3Following a hearing before Lloyd J, the appellant was convicted of each offence. He was fined $400,000 for the offence against s 12 and $8,000 in respect of the offence against s 36(4). He was also ordered to pay the prosecutor's costs.

The reasons of the primary judge

4Having regard to the nature of the issues raised on appeal, it is not necessary to deal with the primary judge's reasons in any great detail. So far as the contravention of s 12 was concerned, he found that clearing occurred, that the clearing was of native vegetation, that there was no development consent or property vegetation plan and that Mr Hudson authorised the clearing. He noted that none of the evidence presented by the prosecutor on these issues was challenged by the person who represented the appellant, a Mr Walters, who was not a qualified lawyer. The primary judge rejected a submission by Mr Walters that the Act was ""null and void"" (an argument not pursued on this appeal) and also rejected a number of other defences brought forward by the appellant. 

5The first of these defences was that the clearing was permitted under s 22 of the Act being for routine agricultural management activities. In that regard the primary judge accepted the undisputed evidence of a Mr Beaman, a compliance investigator employed by the Department of Environment and Climate Change, that only 14 hectares of the land needed to be cleared for routine agricultural management activities. Mr Beaman's evidence was unchallenged.

6The primary judge also rejected the defence that the clearing was part of the permissible activity of removing the noxious week lippia. He noted that the removal of noxious weeds under the Noxious Weeds Act 1993 fell within the definition of routine agricultural management activities. However, he pointed to s 22(2)(a) of the Act which provided that clearing for routine agricultural management activities does not authorise any clearing of native vegetation if it exceeds the minimum extent necessary for the carrying out of the activity. The primary judge accepted that lippia was a noxious weed but referred to the fact that the Moree Plains Shire Council, a ""local control authority"" for the purpose of s 35 of the Noxious Weeds Act, produced a weed management plan for lippia which provided a range of control measures but expressly limited mechanical control unless done under the direct written instructions of the local control authority. His Honour found that the clearing was not done pursuant to such instructions and therefore did not amount to routine agricultural management activity. He also found beyond reasonable doubt that the clearing exceeded the minimum extent necessary for the carrying out of the activity. In this regard he expressed a view, first, that the appellant's contention that the extent of his clearing was necessary to cut tap roots by using a ""cutter bar"" was contrary to the evidence of a Mr Keenan, who was employed to do the clearing and stated he did not use a cutter bar. Secondly, he said there was no evidence to suggest that the massive number of mature trees felled was necessary to cut the tap roots of the lippia. Third, he referred to the fact that only short term control could be achieved by mechanical methods and that herbicides could be used to reduce lippia without harming competitive grasses. Finally, he referred to the fact that long term management of lippia is best obtained through an integrated approach involving herbicides, pasture improvement and grazing management. In that regard he relied on a publication produced by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries.

7The trial judge also rejected a defence raised by the appellant that the clearing activities had been consented to by Ms Elizabeth Savage, a catchment officer with the Border Rivers-Gwydir Catchment Management Authority. In this regard he referred to two letters of Ms Savage which stated that trees over ten years old had to be retained on the land. In that context he rejected the contention that Ms Savage authorised the clearing.

8No additional defences were raised in relation to the offence under s 36. The primary judge stated that to the extent the same defences raised in relation to s 12 were relied on, they were rejected for the same reasons.

9So far as sentencing was concerned, the primary judge stated uncontroversially the factors which he should take into account in imposing sentence. He said that the objective gravity of the offence was reflected in the maximum penalty. He concluded that the seriousness of the offence was affected by the extent to which it may have been done deliberately and stated that the reasons for committing the offence could be taken into account in measuring its objective seriousness. He noted that Mr Hudson did not give evidence and rejected the submission of Mr Walters that the purpose of the clearing was to remove lippia. He found that the purpose was to make more land available for agriculture. In those circumstances he concluded that the offence was within the high range of objective seriousness and the extent of the clearing meant the harm caused was substantial. He stated this was a factor of aggravation.

10So far as individual deterrence was concerned, his Honour expressed satisfaction that since Mr Hudson ignored the advice of Ms Savage and proceeded to do precisely what he was told not to do, that unless deterred by a substantial fine, he was likely to reoffend. He noted that apart from the fact that Mr Hudson was not known to have any record of previous convictions, there were no other mitigating factors, pointing out that nothing was known of Mr Hudson's personal circumstances. He stated, however, that he would take into account the fact that Mr Hudson was a first offender.

11His Honour recognised that s 6(a) of the Fines Act 1996 required him to take into account such information regarding the means of the defendant as was reasonably and practically available to the Court. However, he pointed out that no such information was put before the Court.

12In those circumstances, he imposed the fine referred to above.

The nature of the appeal

13Proceedings brought against the appellant were proceedings in Class 5 under the Land and Environment Court Act 1979. Section 56 of that Act provides that except as provided by the Criminal Appeal Act in relation to proceedings in Class 5, 6 or 7 of the Court's jurisdiction, a decision of the Land and Environment Court should be final and conclusive. Section 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act provides for appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal against conviction, sentence or (subject to leave) an order for costs made against a person by the Supreme Court in the exercise of summary jurisdiction. Section 5AA(4) of that Act deals with the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal on such an appeal. It provides as follows:

""5AA(4)The Court of Criminal Appeal, in proceedings before it on an appeal under this section, may confirm the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction or may order that the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction be vacated and make any determination that the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction could have made on the evidence heard on appeal.""

14Section 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act extends the operation of s 5AA to convictions by the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction.

15It is convenient to set out the grounds of appeal in full:

""Conviction

1.That the prosecution proceedings in respect of Summons 50014/2008 and 50035/2008 ('the Proceedings') were each a nullity in that each prosecution proceeded contrary to law and/or were maintained in contravention of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 (the 'ACT'), section 63.

2.A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the incompetence of the Appellant's legal representative, including, inter alia, in that he:

A.Failed to object to any evidence led by the Prosecutor including unsworn evidence.

B.Failed to cross-examine any Crown witnesses in circumstances where his instructions contradicted those witnesses, and the evidence of such witnesses was prejudicial to the defence.

C.Advanced a defence at law which he was aware or should have been aware had negligible chances of success.

D.Was not competent to act or appear for the Appellants in the proceedings as agent or otherwise.

E.Failed to call evidence and/or make any submissions on behalf of the Appellant on Sentence thereby denying the Court of evidence of relevant considerations on sentence, including, inter alia;

1.That the Appellant did not have a record of any previous convictions (s.21(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW);

2.That the Appellant was a person of good character (s.21(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW);

3.That the Appellant had conducted the Clearing for the purpose of removing the noxious weed Lippia (Affidavit of Kevin Humphries MLA affirmed 14 December 2007, paragraphs 7, 16; TOI of Daniel Keenan dated 1 November 2007, p11 and 28).

4.That the Appellant had expressed to the Crown Witness Mr Kevin Humphries MLA that he was willing to make restitution for any wrong done by him (Affidavit of Kevin Humphries MLA affirmed 14 December 2007, paragraph 16).

5.Evidence from Daniel Keenan to the effect that the clearing of Lippia was not possible on the Property because of an inability to get 'spray riggers' in there (TOI of Daniel Keenan dated 1 November 2007, page 28), notwithstanding that Mr Walters was aware of the crowns position as to the necessary means to remove Lippia;

6.the capacity of the Appellant to pay any fine imposed in circumstances where the Appellant was exposed to a potential fine of $1,100,000 being a relevant consideration pursuant to section 6 of the Fines Act 1996 (NSW);

7.The extra-curial punishment suffered by the Appellant in the nature of large amounts of negative media publicity arising out of the alleged events, in circumstances where authorities establish that such a consideration is relevant to sentence - Vincent Gerard Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; Laws (No 2) (2000) 116 A Crim R 70.

F.Failed to present effectively or competently the Appellant's instructions at trial and/or to advance a coherent legal defence in accordance with those instructions.

G.Failed to call any evidence in support of the defence that the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (NSW), section 12 is invalid and being a law of the state made in furtherance of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State to acquire property or to evade the constitutional guarantee in respect of Yarrol in the Constitution of Australia Act 1901 (Cth), section 51 (xxxi).

3.The Court erred, by one or more of its judicial officers, or by one or more of its Registrars in the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction in relation to the prosecution of the Appellant in that the Appellant did not receive a fair trial, and/or that the Court failed to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to prevent an abuse of process resulting in an unfair trial of the Appellant.

The Appellant gives notice that he will seek the leave of the Court to lead evidence in respect of Grounds 2B and 2F in the Appeal.

Sentence

4.The Court erred in relation to sentence in the following ways:

A.By failing to consider the capacity of the Appellant to pay any fine pursuant to section 6 of the FINES ACT 1996 (NSW);

B.By imputing a Motive to the Appellant, namely that the clearing was done for the purpose of increasing the land available for Agricultural use in circumstances where;

i.The Appellant's representative had advanced an alternative motive (namely that the clearing had been undertaken by consent of the CMA and for the purposes of clearing the noxious weed Lippia); and

ii.There was insufficient evidence before the Court for a finding of a motive that aggravated the sentence, in circumstances where such finding had to be made beyond reasonable doubt.

iii.There was evidence before the Court that the Defendant had performed the clearing under the belief the clearing had been approved by the CMA.

5.The sentence was manifestly excessive.""

16A number of things may be noted about these grounds. First, although the incompetence of the applicant's legal representative is not expressly relied on in relation to the sentence appeal, it is self-evident that some of the matters in ground 2E relate to the sentence appeal as well as the conviction appeal. (See, for example, ground 2E(1), (2), (4), (5), (6) and (7).) Second, ground 2G was not the subject of any submissions on the appeal. Third, ground 3 which on its face is difficult to comprehend was also not the subject of any submissions during the course of the appeal.

The course of the proceedings

17Because of the nature of the appeal and the application to lead fresh evidence, it is important to have regard to the conduct of the proceedings. 

18On 4 July 2008, the proceedings were listed for mention before Jagot J. The appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. He also indicated that he wanted Mr Walters to act on his behalf. Her Honour determined not to go to the details of who could be an agent and appear at that stage but permitted Mr Walters to address the Court.

19Her Honour on a number of occasions during the course of the hearing on that day suggested that the appellant may wish to get legal advice.

20The matter was next listed before Lloyd J on 21 November 2008. During the course of the hearing on that day, Mr Walters indicated that he put in ""an application for a writ of mandamus and prohibition into the Federal Court"" in relation to that matter. Further, he asked Lloyd J the following question:

""One thing if I could ask your Honour is this a criminal prosecution where you will have the power of a Supreme Court judge at common law and equity or will it be a prosecution subject to the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of the Land Court?""

21Lloyd J somewhat unsurprisingly indicated he did not know what the question meant.

22The trial commenced on 1 December 2008. At the outset Mr Walters asked the following question:

""So we are actually in the criminal court of New South Wales?""

23The trial judge indicated that the case was being heard in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales exercising criminal jurisdiction. Immediately after this interchange the trial judge asked the appellant whether he was content for Mr Walters to represent him indicating to him that the charges were serious criminal charges which exposed him (the appellant) to a possible penalty of $1 million. The appellant responded he was aware of that but did not wish to make any further submissions.

24Thereafter the whole of the prosecution case was admitted without objection and without cross-examination. The parties then proceeded to address. I have read Mr Walters' address and with respect it was in the main irrelevant and indicated no real appreciation of the nature of the issues the subject of the charges.

The appeal

25A Notice of Appeal was filed on 2 September 2009.

26On 9 November 2010 an application was made to adduce fresh evidence on the appeal, accompanied by an affidavit of Louise Marie Cassar, a solicitor in the employ of the solicitors for the appellant, identifying the documents sought to be tendered. The documents the subject of this application apparently related to the constitutional issue which I have indicated was not pressed. Accordingly, there is no need to deal with these documents further.

27On 3 March 2011 a further application was made to adduce fresh evidence on the appeal, namely the transcript evidence provided at the committal hearing in R (Cth) v Hudson by Ms Elizabeth Savage, Mr Daniel Keenan and Mr George Boland and further documents produced under subpoena at that committal hearing. 

28The application was also supported by an affidavit of Ms Cassar. She deposed that the issues in the committal proceedings were similar to those raised in the proceedings the subject of the appeal and that on the evidence of the witnesses called by the prosecution in the committal proceedings, there existed an arguable basis that the appellant should have been acquitted.

29On 9 May 2011 a further application was made in similar terms. The affidavit in support exhibited a folder of documents being exhibits of the three witnesses in the committal proceedings. 

30On 16 May 2011 a further application was made to adduce fresh evidence, namely the documents produced under subpoena at the committal hearing of the Commonwealth proceedings.

31In addition, the appeal book contained an affidavit of the appellant which together with annexures comprised some 70 pages. Although no motion was filed to adduce this evidence on the appeal, counsel for the appellant indicated during the course of argument that he wished to rely on this affidavit in support of the allegation that there was a miscarriage of justice.

32Although the material the subject of the application to adduce fresh evidence (apart from the affidavit of Mr Hudson) comprised three relatively large lever arch folders of documents together with a folder of transcripts of the committal hearing, only limited reference was made to it. I indicated during the hearing that to the extent that the documents were relied upon on the appeal, the parties should conduct their argument on the basis that they were admitted and a decision as to their admissibility would be given in the course of this judgment.

The appellant's submissions

33In his written amended submissions dated 11 March 2010 the appellant referred to what were described as background facts designed to support a submission that the respondent had consented to the clearing. The material as referred to by the appellant may be summarised as follows:

(a)At the time of the incidents the subject of the charges Ms Savage was employed as Catchment Co-ordinator (Riverina Ecosystems) with the Border Rivers - Gwydir Catchment Management Authority. In her affidavit of 25 January 2008, Ms Savage exhibited a map which she said reflected discussions in relation to vegetation on the property and the clearing. 

(b)Ms Savage brought copies of what was described as ""an authorisation"", ""a second copy of the PVP"" (a property vegetation plan) and the map referred to in (a) above, to a meeting with the appellant on 13 February 2006, and left them with the appellant. However, Ms Savage's affidavit of 25 January 2008, on which the appellant relies, does not show that Ms Savage said that she left the property vegetation plan with the appellant.

(c)The appellant asserts, referring to a transcript of the interview of Mr Daniel Keenan on 18 December 2007, annexed to the affidavit of Mr Jason Bentley sworn on 25 February 2008 and filed in the proceedings, that the appellant told Mr Keenan that he had spoken to Ms Savage on the evening before, and during that conversation Ms Savage said words to him, the appellant, to the effect: ""You'll be fine. I've spoken to [Mr Keenan] and he knows what he's doing. You know what you're doing, you'll be fine"". The reference given by the appellant to the transcript of interview does not contain any such material. Rather, on the page of the transcript referred to , Mr Keenan stated that he determined the areas to work according to a ""Case Number"" map he had been given. He said that at the time he received the map Mr Hudson also gave him a file full of information that came from Ms Savage, ""it had her business card and all in it"". He said that the appellant told him he had asked Ms Savage if she would like to come out when they were there, but that he, Mr Keenan, never saw her on site. Subsequently in his evidence he identified a yellow manila folder which he said was the folder that he was given. However, it appears from the affidavit of Mr Hudson on which reliance is sought to be placed and the transcript of the evidence of Ms Savage in the committal proceedings to which I have referred, that a conversation of the nature suggested did take place.

(d)The appellant also referred to statements of Mr Keenan in his interview with Mr Bentley to the effect that Mr Hudson told him (Mr Keenan) that Ms Savage did not want particular areas touched.

(e)The appellant placed particular reliance on an interview Ms Savage had had with a compliance investigator, a Mr Stephen Beaman, on 16 May 2007, annexed to the affidavit of Mr Beaman sworn on 25 February 2008, in which the following questions and answers were given:

""Q:My question is: given the obvious environmental values -

A:Yes.

Q:- or however else you want to state it --

A:Yes.

Q:-- there on Yarrol, and given Mr Hudson's - the impression you've given is that Mr Hudson was very concerned about undertaking this clearing. That seems to be evidenced by the number of times you've gone out there and given advice, and the length of time he's taken to consider it - can you tell me why there isn't a PVP there, which basically gives the landholder assurance, or almost insurance that he can go ahead and do the works set out on a PVP, and then very clearly defend the work he's done.

Why have you, it appears, given him advice to use the Ramsar available in the legislation, rather than a PVP, which it would seem to me to give him much more security?

A:The PVP, because of the - because the Coolabah Woodland was identified by Silvertson, and because of the presence of the elderly Coolabahs in the landscape, is an automatic red light.

Q:So you are saying that under a PVP you wouldn't have been able to clear here?

A:That's right. Even though its invasive native species - okay. There's an invasive native species list for this area. However, because of the presence of the large Coolabahs, PVP developer issues a red light for landscape.

Q:So in your role with the CMA, were you aware that he would have got a red light which indicates you can't clear?

A:That's right. I took the PVP developer to his place, ran it and showed him the red light, so that was it.

Q:So we are here now speaking to you about alleged breaches of the Act. The PVP developer indicated a red light indicating not to clear.

A:That's right.

Q:He has now gone ahead and cleared, apparently with your advice?

A:Yes.

Q:Were you at all hesitant to advise him to clear after the red light came up?

A:Because he was - because a red light comes up doesn't mean that you can't use your Ramsar. People need to know what Ramsar they can use.""

It should be noted that this passage does not suggest that there was a property vegetation plan in existence which permitted the clearing to take place.

34The reference to Ramsar is a reference to routine agricultural management activities which are dealt with in s 11 of the Act.

35The appellant referred to a number of conversations he had after the clearing in which he asserted he had permission to clear. These assertions would seem to be of little evidentiary weight.

36The appellant, after referring to the conduct of the trial to which I have referred above, made the following submissions in relation to the particular grounds of appeal.

37Ground 1 - The appellant submitted that s 63(1) of the Land and Environment Court Act provided the only basis on which a non-qualified lawyer could appear in the Land and Environment Court. He submitted that as the right of appearance of a non-qualified agent provided for in that section did not extend to proceedings in Class 5, Mr Walters was not entitled to appear.

38The appellant submitted that there was no residual discretion in the Court to permit a non-qualified agent to appear in Class 5 proceedings. He supported this argument by cases which indicated the approach of the Court that it was only in exceptional cases that persons without legal qualifications were permitted to represent litigants in court: Schagen v The Queen (1993) 8 WAR 410 at 412; Scotts Head Development Pty Limited v Pallisar Pty Limited (Court of Appeal, 6 September 1994, unreported) per Mahoney AP; Damjanovic v Maley [2002] NSWCA 230; (2002) 55 NSWLR 149 at [86]. He emphasised what was said by Mahoney AP in Scotts Head supra, that the reasons for this restriction were based on considerations central to the proper administration of justice and the protection of parties and litigation.

39The appellant emphasised the right of an accused person to a fair trial according to law and submitted, relying on what was said by Kirby P in R v Birlut (1995) 39 NSWLR 1 at 5, that the judge's consent to the appellant being represented by an unqualified person was a procedural requirement that was so significant that it struck ""at the heart of the jurisdiction of the court"".

40At the hearing counsel for the appellant accepted that a court had power to control its own proceedings but suggested that this power was limited by the provisions of s 63 of the Land and Environment Court Act. He submitted that the jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court in Class 5 proceedings was subject to a condition that the accused could only appear in person or by a qualified legal representative and if that condition was not fulfilled the proceedings were a nullity.

41Alternatively, it was submitted that if s 63 did not preclude a court granting leave for a person to be represented by an unqualified person, the judge erred in exercising his discretion in this particular case as there were no exceptional circumstances which required it.

42Ground 2 - The appellant relied on the well-known passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685 to the effect that while generally an accused person will be bound by the way his or her case was conducted by counsel, there may be cases in which something occurs as a result of the ""flagrant incompetence"" of counsel which will be recognised as involving or causing a miscarriage of justice. See also Clee v R [2009] NSWCCA 18 at [27]. He submitted that Mr Walters did not object to any of the evidence led by the prosecution, including sworn evidence, did not seek to cross-examine, and advanced a defence which plainly had no prospects of success, namely that the owner of freehold had a right with which the State could not interfere to clear such vegetation as the owner pleased. He pointed out that this defence sought to be advanced by Mr Walters had been rejected on two occasions by the Queensland Court of Appeal: Burns v State of Queensland & Croton [2007] QCA 240; Watts v Ellis [2007] QCA 234. He also relied on Mr Walters' failure to call any evidence on his behalf on sentence.

43Importantly, he contended that Mr Walters failed to effectively or competently act in accordance with his instructions at the trial and to advance a coherent legal defence in accordance with those instructions. He contended that Mr Walters had received instructions that Ms Savage had authorised a clearing on behalf of the respondent or, alternatively, that he, the appellant, had an honest and reasonable belief of the same. He relied on the material to which I have referred above in support of his arguments, together with an extract from a record of interview with a Mr Boland which was tendered in the proceedings as an exhibit to an affidavit of Jason Robert Bentley sworn on 23 May 2008, in which he, Mr Boland, said that the appellant had told him that the clearing was done under the direction of Ms Savage, and that he, Mr Boland, had received previous advice from Ms Savage that it was necessary to plough lippia in order to remove it. On that basis the appellant contended that the clearing had been performed by him under the direction and by agreement with Ms Savage who was authorised to permit it, or that he had made an honest and reasonable mistake of fact, namely, the documents provided to him by Ms Savage at a meeting in January 2006 were a development consent or property vegetation plan permitting the clearing to take place.

44In supplementary submissions filed by the appellant, he relied on the following evidence of Ms Savage at the committal hearing of September 2010:

(a)That Mr Hudson wanted to know exactly the importance of the vegetation and that in her view he was relying on information given to him by her in carrying out the clearing.

(b)That Mr Hudson adopted a collaborative approach seeking a good outcome.

45The appellant also referred to the evidence of Ms Savage at the committal proceedings in which she agreed she advised the appellant to undertake clearing on areas previously cleared and retain an uncleared buffer zone. Her evidence at the committal proceedings was she had suggested a 200 metre buffer zone around the water, and that this would address the issues raised by her. He referred to the fact that Ms Savage had agreed that he was entitled to remove regrowth.

46The appellant also referred to the fact that Ms Savage gave evidence at the committal proceedings that Mr Hudson had entered into a management conservation contract and that she confirmed that the work done from 12 February 2007 which she observed during a walk through conformed to the work she approved in her discussions with Mr Hudson.

47The appellant also sought to put reliance on the evidence of Mr Keenan, the contractor who did the clearing work. He referred to the fact that Mr Keenan in his evidence in chief at the committal hearing stated that he received information from Ms Savage in a manila folder which contained information on the control of lippia weed and the dimensions of the clearing of the fence line. He pointed out that that was consistent with the evidence of Ms Savage at the committal hearing that she provided a manila folder marked ""To the Contractor"" to the appellant which contained information such as pamphlets about native vegetation and definitions and included a mosaic map. Copies of these documents, which became exhibits in the committal proceedings, formed part of the additional material which the appellant sought to tender at the hearing.

48At the hearing counsel for the appellant contended, first, that there was in fact a permit in existence which permitted the clearing to take place. Second, that the appellant, had he been properly represented, would have been entitled to rely on the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. He initially identified the honest and reasonable mistake of fact three ways. First, a mistake as to the existence of a permit. Second, a mistaken belief that the clearing conformed to the authorisation that Ms Savage gave to the contractor. Third, a mistaken belief that the exception as to regrowth provided in s 19 of the Act applied, and that ""Hudson had no reason to believe, nor did Savage nor Keenan, that they'd transgressed that factual question"". 

49Counsel for the appellant identified the permit as comprising, first, a document entitled ""Map 1: 'Yarrol' Boundary & Paddocks Continuing Use PVP"". This document was an annexure to Ms Savage's affidavit sworn 3 April 2008, relied on by the respondent in these proceedings at first instance. Counsel for the appellant stated that this formed only part of the permit. He said the balance of the permit was contained in documents behind Tab 17 in Exhibit LMC 1 to the affidavit of Ms Cassar of 9 May 2011 filed in support of the application of 9 May to adduce further evidence. The documents, which were exhibits in the committal proceedings, comprised a document headed ""Draft Continuing Use Property Vegetation Plan"" which was stated to commence from the date ""at which it is signed by a delegate of the Minister"". It was not so signed. The next document was a document entitled ""Site Value/Plot Data Sheet"" which contained a PVP number 311. The final document was a management agreement between the appellant and his wife and the Border Rivers Gwydir Catchment Management Authority which related to certain clearing. It was acknowledged by counsel for the appellant that this document was not signed until the clearing, the subject of the proceedings, had in fact concluded. 

50In that context the appellant placed particular reliance on evidence given by Ms Savage at the committal proceedings to the following effect:

""Q.Now, in the course of the inspection that you had with Mr Hudson on 9 January 2006, which you described to his Honour earlier with particular reference to the Lippia infestation, you also provided to Mr Hudson at or about that time, it have been a little bit later, copies of the documents that I have now shown to you?

A.Yes, yes.

Q.If I can just take you to exhibit 14 first, please, do you see that in the reference box in the bottom right-hand side it has the number '4' and then the word 'paddocks', and the number '1' and then the word 'PVP'; do you see that?

A.Mm-hmm.

Q.Now, as I understand it, that is part of your codification built into your system at that time identifying paddocks and then PVP, meaning PVP areas?

A.Yes.

Q.So if we can just look at the case number, exhibit 14, Mr Hudson had previously provided you with an identification of the paddocks. You had then consulted your information and identified various areas of concern in relation to clearing activity, and then you had marked the map with various paddock numbers or area numbers; is that right?

A.That's right, yes.

Q.So, for example, at the house area you've marked that area '4d'?

A.Yes.

Q.And then you see in this copy of exhibit 14 somebody has written in bold upper case the words 'Horse PK'?

A.Yes.

Q.That's Mr Hudson's writing, isn't it?

A.Yes, it is.

Q.Meaning horse paddock?

A.Yes.

Q.And then the next paddock or the next area down, we see it's marked '4KL & M', and it's described by Mr Hudson as 'Billy's paddock'; do you see that?

A.Yes.

Q.But you have identified three areas of interest and concern to you in relation to attention of vegetation, and I won't take you to those, but that's the general gist of it; is that right?

A.Certainly, yes.

Q.And if we can then come down. We cross the channel, the freshwater channel, going south, and then through a gate you come to the dip paddock; do you see that?

A.Yes.

Q.To the left-hand side there's the devisor paddock?

A.Yes.

Q.Then there are gates, three gates along the fence between those two paddocks, and the next large paddock, which is the channel paddock, the subject of this matter; is that right?

A.Yes, yes.

Q.Again Mr Hudson has identified the gates by a square with a cross and the names of the paddocks in the handwriting to which you've referred?

A.Yes.

Q.Then is it fair to say that at this time, that is on or about 9 January 2006, you identified for him some of the issues that would need to be addressed in relation to clearing and your handwriting appears on this document in that regard?

A.Yes, it does, yes.

Q.And the words 'Voluntary 200 metre buffer zone', with a squiggly line going through the middle of the channel paddock, is a reference, is it not, to the suggestion that you'd made to Mr Hudson that he adopt that advice of yours to address the bird questions you had raised in your letter of 9 December 2004?

A.Yes.

QIt was your view, wasn't it, that if the buffer zone was put in place by Hudson, that it would address the issues that you had raised in the letter?

A.Yes.""

51The document referred to in that passage of cross-examination as Exhibit 14 was the document at Tab 2 of Exhibit LMC 1 to the affidavit of Ms Cassar of 9 May 2011. It was the document entitled ""Map 1: 'Yarrol' Boundary & Paddocks Continuing use PVP"" to which I have referred earlier.

52The appellant also referred to the evidence of Mr Keenan at the committal hearing to the effect that he believed that all trees he cleared were regrowth trees, saying that this was also a mistake of fact. This was put in support of the third way he put this defence (see par [48] above).

53In support of the proposition that the mistakes to which he referred were mistakes of fact, senior counsel said the position was analogous to that considered by Reeves J in the Federal Court in Mei Ying Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 2) [2008] FCA 1485; (2008) 251 ALR 135 where the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was upheld in circumstances where a fisherman believed that his navigational position was outside the area for which a fishing licence was required.

54In supplementary submissions directed to the question of whether the principles in cases such as R v Birks supra applied where the accused was not represented by a qualified lawyer but rather an unqualified person, the appellant relied on a number of cases which emphasised the importance of ensuring an accused person received a fair trial and in particular referred to MacPherson v R [1981] HCA 46; (1981) 147 CLR 512 and Frawley v R (1993) 69 A Crim R 208 where new trials were ordered in circumstances where the Court considered that an unrepresented accused did not receive a fair trial.

55Ground 3 - The appellant essentially relied on his submissions in relation to ground 2 above.

The submissions of the respondent

56The respondent pointed out that the combined operation of s 5AA and s 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act meant that an appeal is of the same nature as that for which s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act provides. She submitted that in these circumstances, the appellant must demonstrate error on the part of the Land and Environment Court.

57The respondent submitted that s 63 of the Land and Environment Court Act conferred an as of right entitlement to lay representation in proceedings in Classes 1-4: Milne v Minister for Planning [2006] NSWLEC 745 at [14]. She submitted that the section could not be construed as depriving the Land and Environment Court of a discretion to allow lay persons from appearing in Class 5 proceedings, having regard to the context and purpose of the relevant legislation. She submitted that to the extent that the trial judge exercised a discretion to allow Mr Walters to appear, there was nothing to suggest his discretion miscarried. The Director General sought to distinguish the present case from cases where a trial has miscarried due to the incompetence of counsel. She referred to the fact that the recognition and regulation of legal practitioners as officers of the court give rise to a presumption that they possess specialist skills and that an accused is entitled to assume a practitioner possesses those skills when instructing him or her to act on the implied understanding that he or she is to have complete control over the way the case is conducted: see TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124 at 147 [74]; Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; (1992) 177 CLR 292. 

58In that context the respondent emphasised that although the Land and Environment Court was a statutory court it had by implication such powers as were incidental and necessary to the exercise of its jurisdiction which powers include an inherent right to allow a person (not being a lawyer) to conduct a case on behalf of a party where it is desirable to do so in the interests of justice. She submitted that s 63 did not oust this jurisdiction. In his oral submissions, the Solicitor-General who appeared on behalf of the respondent in the present case, submitted that the fact that the Land and Environment Court had the power to regulate its own proceedings including permitting an unqualified person to appear, was supported by the decision of this Court in Damjanovic v Marley supra at [33] and by the decision of the Privy Council in O'Toole v Scott (1965) AC 939.

59The respondent submitted that having regard to the role that legal practitioners play, it is hardly surprising that flagrant incompetence on their part in a trial can give rise to a miscarriage of justice. She submitted initially that none of those considerations arose in the case of lay representation. However, in supplementary submissions filed at the direction of the Court she accepted that whether or not the appellant was legally represented the primary judge was under an obligation to ensure he received a fair trial in which the rules of procedure and the laws of evidence were properly followed: McPherson v The Queen supra; R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91. She accepted the statement made by Gleeson CJ in R v Frawley supra at 212 that in the circumstances of the present case the Court must consider whether there was a miscarriage of justice but it does so in a context in which the fact that the appellant was unrepresented was a result of his own conduct. 

60The respondent also submitted there was no miscarriage of justice in the present case. She submitted that neither particular criticism made by the appellant nor any of the additional material demonstrated that there was such a miscarriage. She submitted by reference to the affidavit of Mr Hudson that the highest the case on honest and reasonable mistake could arise was that he was authorised to clear the land within the boundaries of a map provided to him by Ms Savage. She submitted that that was not a mistake of fact. She also submitted that such a belief could not reasonably be held having regard to the letter from Ms Savage to Mr Hudson of 9 December 2004 and her letter to Mr and Mrs Hudson of 13 February 2006 

The appellant's submissions in reply

61Counsel for the appellant in reply acknowledged that the relevant belief held by the appellant was the one set out in par [26] of his affidavit. He reformulated the belief which he stated was held by the appellant in the following terms:

""What Mr Hudson believed was having regard to the map which had been marked up specifying that the trees, the corridors to be left which were left and specifying the paddocks which were to be used in a PVP the four paddocks, the continuing use PVP and the management agreement in relation to clearing parts of the land for the benefit of the local CMA - what was called the 'birdie track' for which Mr Hudson was paid by the CMA - that he had a what's called a continuing use PVP or an authority or consent to clear those areas which in fact were cleared. And that the conversation with Ms Savage the night before the clearing commenced, which everybody agrees occurred, was evidence of that consent independently of the documents that were handed to Mr Hudson and given to the clearer in a folder marked 'to the contractor' with her card in it.""

62In support of the proposition that the mistake was a mistake of fact not a mistake of law he relied on the decision of the High Court in Brickworks Limited v The Council of The Shire of Warringah (1963) 108 CLR 568.

Consideration

Ground 1

63Section 63(1) of the Land and Environment Court Act in terms entitles a litigant as of right to appear by an authorised agent in proceedings in the Court except in proceedings in Classes 5,6 or 7. It does not in terms prohibit the Court granting leave for an agent to appear in proceedings in those Classes. The purpose of the subsection was self-evidently to give persons with expertise in the areas within the jurisdiction of the Court, town planners and the like, the right to appear whilst not extending that right to the criminal and quasi-criminal matters generally covered by Classes 5, 6 and 7.

64In my opinion this section does not by necessary implication prohibit the Court from giving leave to a person being represented by an unqualified person in Class 5 proceedings. Even though the Court is a statutory Court it has the power to control its own proceedings. In Damjanovic v Maley supra, an appeal from a decision by a District Court (a statutory court) judge to refuse leave to commit an unqualified person to represent a plaintiff, Stein JA, with whom Mason P and Sheller JA agreed, made the following remarks (at [33]):

""[33]According to Halsbury's Laws of Australia a court has an inherent right, in regulating its own proceedings, to allow a person (not being a lawyer) to conduct a case on behalf of a party where it is desirable to do so in the interests of the administration of justice.""

See also O'Toole v Scott supra.

65Section 63(1) is to be construed having regard to its object and purpose: Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [91]; R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; (2005) 64 NSWLR 10 at [44]-[45]. I have set out the object and purpose above. The object, in my opinion, was not to impose a limitation on the powers of the Court to regulate its own proceedings.

66The contrary argument is not advanced by the provisions of s 63(2) which requires leave of the Court for an unqualified person to represent a litigant in Class 8 proceedings. Section 63(2) was inserted in the Land and Environment Court Act at the same time as the Land and Environment Court was given jurisdiction in Class 8 proceedings (see the Courts and Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Act 2008). The view is evidently taken by the legislature that unqualified persons should not appear in any matters arising under the Mining Act 1992 without leave. It does not seem to me that the insertion of s 63(2) to give effect to this intention leads to the conclusion that it was otherwise the intention of the legislature to remove the power of the Court in proceedings in Classes 5, 6 and 7 to permit unqualified persons to appear with leave.

67Even if this was not correct it would not follow the proceedings were a nullity. The relevant question is whether an act done in breach of the provision is invalid: Project Blue Sky supra at [93]; R v Janceski supra at [46]. It does not seem to me that there is anything to suggest that the legislature intended that the consequence of permitting an unqualified person to appear was that the proceedings would be a nullity. Any difficulty which arose as a consequence of representation by an unqualified person, if it involved an error of law or miscarriage of justice, could be dealt with on appeal. There does not seem to me to be any reasons to suggest that the legislative intention was to the contrary. 

68Nor do I think that the primary judge erred as a matter of discretion in permitting Mr Walters to appear. In circumstances where no objection was taken by either party there does not seem to me to be any room to say that the discretion miscarried. Even if there was an erroneous exercise of discretion that would not nullify the proceedings. It follows that ground 1 is not made out.

Grounds 2 and 3

69The respondent did not seriously contest that the conduct of the case by Mr Walters was incompetent. It only has to be stated that he focused on issues which were plainly unarguable. Irrespective of whether there are differences in consideration of the question in a context of incompetent legal representation or incompetent self-representation or representation by an unqualified person, the ultimate question is whether what occurred at the trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice. In the present case, at least so far as the conviction was concerned, there does not seem to me to have been any such miscarriage. It was put first that it should have been contended that there was a permit in existence. I have set out in par [49] above what was said to constitute the permit. With respect it could not be said on any view that the documents referred to in that paragraph, whether considered alone or together, could be said to constitute a permit. If by the expression 'permit' it was intended to convey there was a development consent granted in accordance with the Act, it is clear that there was not if only because there is nothing to suggest that the relevant consent authority, the Minister, had granted consent as required by s 13 of the Act.

70It is equally clear that there was no property vegetation plan within the meaning of s 12(1)(b). Such a plan only has effect if approved by the Minister (s 27(1)). There is nothing to suggest that the Minister had approved any such plan. Further, there is no evidence to suggest the Minister had delegated his approval function under s 48(2) of the Act. Even if it could be inferred that he had, the draft plan relied upon was stated to commence from the date it was signed by a delegate of the Minister. There is no evidence that it was ever signed.

71It follows that to the extent Mr Walters failed to contend that a permit was in existence, there was no miscarriage of justice.

72It is also alleged that there was a miscarriage of justice in that Mr Walters failed to adduce evidence or make submissions going to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. That defence is available to a person prosecuted for a contravention of s 12 of the Act: Director General of the Department of Land and Water Conservation v Greentree [2002] NSWLEC 102 at [90], on appeal [2003] NSWCCA 31; (2003) 140 A Crim R 25 at [67]-[71]. However, the mistake must be a mistake of fact not a mistake of law: He Kew Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 534-535, 582; Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30; (2004) 218 CLR 493 at [10], [46]. In the latter paragraph McHugh J made the following remarks which are apposite to this case:

""[46]Thus, it is no defence to a criminal charge that the defendant believed that his or her actions were not regulated by law or that his or her actions satisfied the provisions of a law. Such beliefs are mistakes of law, not mistakes of fact. In Von Lieven v Stewart, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales held that the belief by a promoter of a scheme operated by a company that the scheme 'neither involved an offer to the public nor a prescribed interest' and accordingly did not contravene the Companies (New South Wales) Code or the Securities Industry (New South Wales) Code was a mistake of law, not fact. It provided no defence to charges of breaching provisions of those Codes. Clarke JA said that, once the defendant knows all the facts which constitute the elements of the offence, a mistake as to their legal effect is not a defence to a criminal charge. Handley JA (with whom Mahoney JA agreed) said: 

'[A] belief or assumption that the acts in question are lawful either because they are unregulated, or because the requirements of the law have been satisfied, cannot excuse in cases such as this. ... The only excuse is the existence of an actual or positive belief, based on reasonable grounds, in the existence of some fact or facts which, if true, would make the act in question innocent.'""

73McHugh J also emphasised (at [53]-[54]) that it was immaterial that the error was induced by erroneous advice by a government official.

74In par [26] of the affidavit of the appellant which was sought to be relied upon, he stated his belief as follows:

""As a result of the conversations that I had previously had with Ms Savage since 2003, and the conversations had between Ms Savage and I referred to in paragraphs 11 to 24 above, I held a belief that I had been authorised by the CMA, and the Minister, to clear the land within the boundaries of the authorisation as outlined in the map provided to me by Ms Savage.""

75I have indicated earlier how this belief was reformulated on the appeal (par [61]).

76Irrespective of whether regard is had to the belief deposed to by the appellant or to the belief as reformulated, it seems to me that to the extent there was a mistake it was a mistake of law, either that the documents received from Ms Savage constituted sufficient authorisation to enable the clearing to take place, or that Ms Savage had authority to consent to the clearing. Either error is a mistake of law. The position is indistinguishable from that considered by the High Court in Ostrowski supra and the decision of this Court in Von Lieven v Stewart (1990) 21 NSWLR 52 cited with approval by McHugh J in Ostrowski.

77Counsel for the appellant placed particular reliance on two decisions, the decision of the Federal Court in Mei Ying Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 2) supra and the decision of the High Court in Brickworks Limited v The Council of the Shire of Warringah supra. Neither of these two cases assists the appellant. The first involved a mistake by a fisherman as to his navigational position. The mistake led him to the conclusion that he was not within Australian waters. There was no issue that had the belief held by the fisherman been correct he would not have been in Australian waters. The mistake in that case was a mistake as to his navigational position, not a mistaken belief that he was authorised to fish in Australian waters or a mistaken belief as to their territorial limits. Had the mistake been of the latter category it would have constituted a mistake of law. It provides no assistance in the present case, where the relevant belief is a belief that a person was authorised to carry out a particular act.

78The decision of the High Court in Brickworks supra provides no assistance. The issue in Brickworks was whether the respondent Council had failed to discharge the onus of proving that it had not consented to a particular development. The majority held it had not (see at 577, 589). The decision has no relevance to the issue in the present case. It follows that the failure of Mr Walters to adduce evidence and rely on the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact did not cause a miscarriage of justice.

79In these circumstances ground 2 of the Notice of Appeal is not made out. It was not suggested that ground 3 raised any different issues, so it also cannot succeed.

80In the result, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

The appeal against sentence

The course of the hearing

81Following conclusion of submissions on the question of contravention, it was agreed between the parties that submissions would be made on sentence so there would be no need for a separate hearing if the primary judge found that the contraventions had been made out.

82Mr Walters' initial submission on sentence was to the following effect:

""Your Honour, I've asked it to be totally dismissed with no penalties and that's it. If you find penalties well there's nothing. That is your decision and yours alone.""

83Following those remarks his Honour indicated he would hear from counsel for the present respondent.

84Counsel for the present respondent then addressed the Court, followed by Mr Walters on behalf of the appellant. Mr Walters' address was short and because it graphically illustrates his total inability to grasp the nature of the case and the issues raised on sentence it should be set out in full:

""All I can say is your Honour that my learned friend just said a criminal matter, not a quasi criminal matter. To have a criminal proceedings in this court, Mr Hudson - and I refer to the correspondence from Ms Hicks where she said 'this is a criminal ... in the land'. How can you have a criminal proceedings brought by the state for property which they are supposed to have an interest in, which they don't, for a criminal offence. All criminal offences revolve around the ownership of the property. Why do we have a problem with euthanasia. It doesn't matter if you're two seconds off it, your personal property it starts with your life. No one can decide to remove it.

The charge is murder, a malice of forethought, mens rea and actus reus. If you're two second off the end of your breath. Mr Hudson owns his property at common law and equity, this State has no interest in it. It was sold of the Crown and he paid for it. That is why when the Act says the Crown in that capacity, this legislative government, or the executive government has the Crown in a different capacity, therefore subject to the Statutory Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act, that if he had signed agreement, if he had and it was registered on his title deed they then had an interest in the property. And if they had on that title deed and in the interest, and in the civil law where you sign it to breach it, and everything revolves around common law, our right to move. My right to get on an aeroplane tomorrow and go to far north Queensland without having to get a permit to enter Queensland.""

85There then followed a short interchange between the primary judge and Mr Walters. Mr Walters concluded by making the following remarks:

""If you do say you are going to convict him you record the conviction with no penalty and no fine. And if it goes the other way, they pay his relevant costs to the relevant legal people, and his travel, nothing else.""

86Following those remarks the hearing on sentence concluded.

87I have summarised the primary judge's remarks on sentence above (see pars [9]-[11]).

The parties' submissions

88The appellant submitted that the primary judge erred in failing to consider the capacity of the appellant to pay any fine pursuant to s 6 of the Fines Act 1996 (NSW). In fact this submission is incorrect as absent any submission to the contrary, the trial judge took the view that the appellant had the capacity to pay any fine. The appellant's real complaint is that Mr Walters failed to make any submissions on the issue. 

89The appellant also submitted that there was no basis for the trial judge for inferring that the purpose of the clearing was to increase the land available for agricultural use. He submitted that the Court should not have drawn the inference unless it was satisfied that the matter had been proved beyond reasonable doubt and that there was insufficient evidence to enable this inference to be drawn. Reliance was placed in that context on certain statements made by the appellant as to his purpose of clearing after the clearing had taken place and on the discussions which the appellant had had with Ms Savage to which I have earlier referred.

90The appellant finally submitted that the penalty was manifestly excessive relying on a series of what was said to be comparable cases.

91Further, as I have indicated earlier ground 2E of the notice of appeal alleges that a miscarriage of justice in the sentencing procedure occurred as a result of the incompetence of Mr Walters. 

92The respondent submitted that for the appeal against sentence to succeed it was necessary to demonstrate error. She submitted that there was no error in the trial judge inferring the appellant was able to pay any fine absent any submission to the contrary. She contended that it was open to the primary judge, absent any acceptable evidence, to conclude that the clearing was done for the purpose of making more land available for agriculture, pointing out that a desire to clear the land of lippia was consistent with this purpose. So far as the appellant's submissions that the sentence was manifestly excessive were concerned, she pointed to the danger of relying on cases involving different factual scenarios and different penalties.

93In supplementary submissions, as previously noted, the respondent acknowledged that whether or not the appellant was legally represented at the trial, the primary judge was under an obligation to ensure he received a fair trial in which the rules of procedure and the laws of evidence were properly followed. She submitted that the proper approach was to view the trial as though the appellant had represented himself and that the primary judge was in those circumstances required to provide some assistance to the appellant. She submitted that the particular obligations of a trial judge in the context of a hearing on sentence where a convicted person is unrepresented were addressed in Cooling v Steel (1971) 2 SASR 249 and Wood v Marsh (2003) 139 A Crim R 475 at [35]-[40] (483-485). The respondent further accepted that if the Court were to conclude that the primary judge ought to have provided a greater explanation to the appellant of the sentencing process and his rights thereto and that as a result the appellant had been deprived of an opportunity to adduce evidence of his belief that the clearing was authorised, that evidence might have had an impact on the sentence imposed.

Consideration

94I have set out above Mr Walters' submissions on sentence. They were plainly inept and should have confirmed to the trial judge what was probably already apparent to him from the conduct of the trial, namely, that Mr Walters was quite incapable of representing the appellant.

95The primary judge in those circumstances was obliged, in my opinion, to take steps to ensure that the sentencing procedure was conducted fairly. Whether or not he should have revoked Mr Walters' leave to appear at that stage, he should at least had ensured that the appellant knew that he was exposed to significant pecuniary penalties and of his right to make submissions and to adduce evidence in mitigation of the penalty: see Cooling v Steel supra; Wood v Marsh supra. The primary judge made no such attempt.

96In my opinion, the respondent was correct in stating that the appellant was in the same position as an unrepresented litigant. In these circumstances the primary judge was under an obligation to ensure that the trial including the proceedings so far as they related to sentence, was conducted fairly: Macpherson v The Queen supra at 546; R v Zorad supra at 108; R v Frawley supra at 212.

97The result of such failure was that the appellant was not made aware of the opportunity to put before the Court matters of mitigation including his belief that he was entitled to clear the land and the evidence which gave rise to the belief summarised in pars [33], [44]-[47] and [50]-[52] above. These matters were capable of having significant impact on the penalty to be imposed.

98In my opinion, therefore, the trial judge erred in failing to ensure that that part of the proceedings which dealt with the question of sentence was conducted fairly and the accused thereby lost the opportunity of putting before the Court matters which could have impacted on the penalty imposed. In these circumstances the penalties imposed should be set aside.

99As I have taken the view that the primary judge fell into error in the manner I have identified and that there was a real prospect that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice, there is no need in this case to consider the interrelationship of s 5(1), s 5AA and s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act: see Gilmour v Environment Protection Authority [2002] NSWCCA 399; (2002) 55 NSWLR 593 at [15]-[27]; Kirk Group Holdings Pty Limited v WorkCover Authority of NSW [2006] NSWCA 172; (2006) 66 NSWLR 151 at [73]-[75], [118]-[127]. It is not necessary in this case to go beyond s 5AA and s 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act to determine the issues in this appeal.

100There remains the question of the future conduct of the proceedings. The parties agreed that if this Court was of the view that the sentence should be quashed, it was not possible for it to resentence the appellant. That is correct. A great deal of the evidence sought to be tendered was inadmissible in form. Whilst the respondent did not oppose the admission on this ground alone, so far as it went to the question of miscarriage of justice, it does not mean it would be admissible on any sentencing hearing. Further, the respondent will be entitled to test the evidence given by Mr Hudson at any sentencing hearing.

101In these circumstances the question arose whether there is power to remit the sentencing proceedings to the Land and Environment Court. Each party contended there was such power, the appellant basing it on what he described as the Court's inherent jurisdiction, the respondent on s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

102Section 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act gives a court power to remit a matter or issue to a court of trial. A court of trial is not defined but would mean the court in which the proceedings were determined at first instance. The question of the appropriate sentence on conviction would fall within the meaning of the expression ""matter or issue"". In these circumstances, the Court has power to remit the question of sentence to the Land and Environment Court and should do so.

The additional evidence sought to be tendered

103As will be apparent from what I have written above some but not all of the additional evidence sought to be tendered by the appellant goes to the issue of miscarriage of justice and should be admitted. Leave to admit the balance of the evidence should be refused. That approach is consistent with what was said by Gleeson CJ in R v Frawley supra at 212 that in the case of a litigant unrepresented at trial this Court should treat the subject of fresh or new evidence in a more flexible manner than might otherwise be the case. However, as I indicated above the question of the admissibility of that evidence on any sentencing hearing will be a matter for the sentencing judge.

104In these circumstances I would make the following orders:

1Grant leave to the appellant to tender the following material:

(a)The affidavit of John Ross Hudson sworn on 9 March 2010;

(b)The transcript evidence provided at the committal hearing in R (Commonwealth) v John Ross Hudson by Elizabeth Savage, Daniel Keenan and George Boland;

2Reject the tender of all other fresh or new evidence sought to be relied on by the appellant at the hearing.

3Dismiss the appeal so far as it relates to conviction.

4Quash the penalties imposed by Lloyd J on 11 Feb 2009.

5Remit the proceedings to the Land and Environment Court for the purpose of determining the appropriate penalty to be imposed on the appellant.

105WHEALY JA: I agree with Bathurst CJ

106McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

		15 May 2012",2012-05-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759243,TWL v R (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 93,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  By order made on 16 February 2012 this Court quashed the appellant's conviction for the manslaughter of Mr Jamie Purdon on 20 February 2009.  By judgment of 5 April 2012, the Court gave its reasons for making that order and, for reasons that it stated, made an order that the appellant be retried.
2Within 14 days of that judgment, the appellant applied pursuant to r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules for the setting aside of the order for his retrial.  He submitted, first, the Court had not dealt fully with his ground of appeal that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence and, secondly, that if the Court completed its consideration of that ground of appeal it should, and would, conclude that the order for retrial should be set aside and a verdict of acquittal of the appellant entered.
3The application appears to proceed upon the assumption that when I dealt with this ground of appeal in my judgment of 5 April 2012 I did no more than conclude that as a matter of law there was evidence capable of sustaining the jury's verdict of guilty (see SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [20], second sentence).  This assumption is erroneous.  As is apparent from my discussion in the judgment of the evidence that was given at the trial, I made a full and independent assessment of it.  This led me to conclude that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged ([66]).  This conclusion was to the same effect as that reached by Grove AJ (with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J) in Almeddine v R [2012] NSWCCA 63 where his Honour stated, after receiving the evidence, that ""I do not conclude that it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"" (at [63]; and see SKA at [14]).
4Moreover, my conclusion fulfilled the requirement stated in SKA at [21] that the Court of Criminal Appeal ""determine whether the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged"".
5I declined however to take the additional step of answering the further question posed in SKA of ""whether on the evidence the Court was satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the offences"" (at [59]-[60]; SKA at [20]).  I indicated that I did that because it was inappropriate for me to form and express a view, based upon what I had found to be a flawed trial process, as to whether at the trial the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged ([60]).  I remain of that view.  
6For this Court to answer that question in the affirmative would be unfair to the appellant, given that he did not have a fair opportunity to defend the Crown's case and the correct directions were not provided to the jury.  My view, expressed after an independent assessment of the evidence, that it was open to the jury on the evidence before it to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the offence was sufficient to disentitle the appellant to an acquittal.  It would have brought the administration of justice into disrepute for this Court to have expressed the view that the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged when the appellant was to stand trial again and have the benefit of the presumption of innocence at that further trial.
7For these reasons I propose that the appellant's application be dismissed.
8RA HULME J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.
9GARLING J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2759244,Geddes v R [2012] NSWCCA 94,"Judgment

1WHEALY JA: Aaron Geddes, (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge at the Sydney District Court on 11 February 2011.

2On 23 August 2010 when the matter was listed for trial, the applicant pleaded guilty to four charges, namely:

Count 1: on 20 October 2008, accessory after the fact to robbery in company contrary to ss 97(1)/349 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (maximum penalty 14 years' imprisonment).

Count 2: on 5 November 2008, accessory after the fact to armed robbery contrary to ss 97(2)/349 Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 14 years' imprisonment).

Count 3: between 4 November 2008 and 11 December 2008, recklessly possessing proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(3) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 10 years' imprisonment).

Count 4: on 10 December 2008, robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97(2) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 25 years' imprisonment).

3There was no applicable standard non-parole period.

4Her Honour was also asked to take into account in respect of Count 4 a Form 1 containing four offences of attempt steal motor vehicle and one offence of steal motor vehicle. 

5On 11 February 2011 the applicant was sentenced as follows:

Count 1: imprisonment for a fixed term of 15 months to commence from 10 December 2008 and to expire on 9 March 2010.

Count 2: imprisonment for a fixed term of 20 months to commence from 10 December 2009 and to expire on 9 August 2011.

Count 3: imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 months to commence from 10 December 2009 and to expire on 9 February 2010.

Count 4: a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years to commence from 10 December 2010 and to expire on 9 December 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months to expire on 9 March 2015.

6The total effective sentence was one of imprisonment for 6 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 4 years. The non-parole period represented 64% of the total term. 

7Her Honour allowed a 15% discount on account of the applicant's pleas of guilty and made a finding of special circumstances.

Proceedings on sentence

8In relation to counts 1 and 2, there was a dispute in relation to the factual basis upon which the applicant was to be sentenced. As these matters were critical to the principal ground of appeal, I shall set out the content of the disputed matters in some detail. In addition, I shall mention the circumstances underlying counts 3 and 4.

The non-contested facts may be summarised as follows:

9Count 1: At about 12.30am on 20 October, Kirk Crossley stole a motor vehicle from the driveway of a house in Lemon Tree Passage. Shortly thereafter he returned to his home at Medowie and met with Nash Cobb. Crossley and Cobb discussed committing a break and enter offence at the Tomago Bowling Club where they intended to steal an Automatic Teller Machine. At about 2.30am they drove to the Club and conducted surveillance of the premises. However at about 5.20am they were disturbed and they left and drove off.

10As Crossley and Cobb passed the Heatherbrae Pie Shop they agreed to rob those premises instead. At about 5.45am Cobb drove into the car park of the premises. Cobb and Crossley exited the vehicle and then entered the shop. They were wearing dark clothing and disguises. Crossley was armed with a screwdriver. 

11Inside the shop the two offenders confronted staff and demanded money. Cobb armed himself with a kitchen knife and demanded the contents of the safe. The two offenders exited the shop having stolen $21,299. They decamped in the stolen vehicle.

12Immediately after the robbery Crossley telephoned the applicant and informed him that they had committed a robbery at Heatherbrae Pies. Crossley asked the applicant to monitor a scanner which was able to intercept the police radio frequency thereby enabling him to monitor the reaction and movements of police responding to the robbery. 

13Count 2: At about 10.55pm on 5 November 2008 Crossley and two unknown offenders drove to the Hexham Bowling Club in a stolen unregistered motor vehicle. The three offenders entered the club wearing dark clothing and disguises covering their faces. One of the offenders was armed with a shortened single barrel shot gun and another with a long-handled screw driver. A staff member was forced at gunpoint to open the safe. The offenders stole $48,000 during the robbery and then fled in the stolen motor vehicle. 

14Immediately after committing the offence Crossley telephoned the applicant. Crossley informed the applicant that they had committed an armed robbery at the Hexham Bowling Club and asked him to monitor the scanner and advise him of the reaction and movement of police responding to the robbery. 

15Count 3: At about 12.30am on 5 November 2008 Crossley and two unknown offenders stole bottles of alcohol worth a total of $4,266.78 after smashing the front window of the Tea Gardens Cellars. On 17 December 2008, police executed a search warrant at a caravan owned by the applicant's parents and located seven bottles of stolen alcohol. On 19 December 2008 police searched the applicant's motor vehicle and located a further two bottles of stolen alcohol. The total value of the alcohol found in the caravan and motor vehicle was $245.

16Count 4: At about 10.25pm on 9 December 2008 Crossley and Rhys McKinley stole a motor vehicle. Shortly after midnight on 10 December 2008 Crossley was observed driving the stolen motor vehicle in a westerly direction on Ferodale Road, Medowie. A short time later the applicant was seen leaving 12 Maple Close Medowie and then driving in the same direction as the stolen motor vehicle. Police lawfully monitored telephone conversations between Crossley and the applicant. It was apparent from those conversations that the two met at Ringwood Road, Medowie and that the applicant helped Crossley and McKinley conceal the stolen motor vehicle. 

17At around 1.30pm on 10 December 2008 the applicant drove Crossley and McKinley to the vicinity of Hexham Bowling Club in order to conduct surveillance. Following that the applicant returned Crossley and McKinley to 12 Maple Close, Medowie before returning home. 

18At 4.50pm Crossley sent an SMS message to the applicant that read, ""no wot u got to keep your mind on cuz!"", an instruction to stay focused and remember what he had to do.

19A short time later Crossley telephoned his girlfriend and asked her to prepare clothing and retrieve a shotgun from outside in preparation for their return. 

20Shortly before 10pm the applicant was observed leaving Maple Close, Medowie with Crossley and McKinley. A short time later Crossley and McKinley drove the stolen motor vehicle to Hexham Bowling Club. Between 10.25pm and 11pm police officers lawfully intercepted and monitored telephone calls between the offenders. It was evident from those conversations that it was the applicant's role to man the scanner and inform the others of any police presence or activity. 

21At about 11pm Crossley and McKinley parked the stolen motor vehicle outside the Hexham Bowling Club. They were both wearing balaclavas and McKinley was armed with a loaded, shortened .410 gauge shotgun. They kicked open a door of the premises and confronted a male staff member. They demanded that he take them to the strong room where they stole $37,466. As they left the club they were confronted by police and subsequently arrested.

22The applicant was arrested shortly thereafter at about 11.30pm. A police search of the applicant's vehicle revealed the presence of a scanner. A search warrant was subsequently executed at the applicant's residence where another scanner was located. 

23Form 1 offences: The first four offences on the Form 1 related to unsuccessful attempts committed on 8 December 2012 to steal a motor vehicle for use in the projected robbery at the Hexham Bowling Club. The fifth offence relating to the successful theft of the motor vehicle ultimately used in that armed robbery. 

Contested facts:

24In relation to counts 1 and 2 the applicant agreed that he was an accessory after the fact by reason of his manning the scanner. The Crown, however, alleged that the applicant provided further assistance in relation to both those robberies. 

25In respect of count 1 the Crown alleged that during a telephone conversation between Crossley and the applicant, that took place after the robbery at the Heatherbrae Pie Shop, the applicant agreed to meet Crossley and Cobb near the entrance to Wallaroo National Park for the purpose of providing transport to them after they had disposed of the stolen motor vehicle they had been using. The applicant then drove his own vehicle to the entrance of the National Park where he met Crossley and Cobb. The vehicles were then driven in convoy to a location within the National Park where Cobb and Crossley set fire to the stolen vehicle. Crossley and Cobb then entered the applicant's vehicle and the three men returned to Crossley's residence where the applicant was given $2,000 from the proceeds of the robbery as payment for his assistance. 

26In respect of count 2 the Crown alleged that during the telephone conversation between Crossley and the applicant, that took place immediately after the armed robbery at Hexham Bowling Club, Crossley told the applicant that the stolen motor vehicle that he had been using had mechanical trouble and that he had been forced to stop. The applicant agreed to drive his own vehicle to a location at Tomago where he collected Crossley and the other two offenders. The four men then returned to Crossley's house where the applicant was given a sum of money from the proceeds of the armed robbery for his assistance.

The evidence at the sentencing hearing - disputed facts

27A document entitled, ""Crown Submissions on Sentence"" which set out the facts, including the contested facts, as asserted by the Crown became exhibit E (POS 28/1/11 p 1). The ""Defence Bundle"" of documents, which became exhibit 1, included a document entitled ""Facts asserted by Crown on sentence with assertions disputed by defence marked"". Within that document the contested facts had been marked by being struck through (POS 17.12.10 p 6).

28The Crown called Nash Cobb to give evidence during the sentencing proceedings. A statement of Mr Cobb, dated 10 June 2010, was tendered as exhibit D. Importantly, Mr Cobb's evidence related to count 1 only. He said that he was sitting beside Crossley when Crossley telephoned the applicant after the offence. During the conversation the applicant was asked to pick Crossley and Cobb up after they had dumped the stolen car at the National Park. The applicant was asked to meet them at the top of the Medowie turn off. 

29Approximately 20 to 25 minutes after the phone call the applicant, who was driving a red Nissan Patrol four wheel drive, met them at the designated location and the two vehicles drove further into the park. After stopping the vehicles he and Crossley transferred a number of items, including a sledge hammer and the proceeds of the robbery, from the stolen vehicle to the applicant's vehicle. He and Crossley then set alight the stolen vehicle. They then entered the applicant's vehicle and were driven to Crossley's premises at Medowie. There they counted the money and divided it up. Mr Cobb was unable to recall if the applicant was given any money (POS 15).

30The applicant gave evidence. In respect of count 1 he denied meeting Crossley and Cobb at the National Park after they had committed the offence at the Heatherbrae Pie Shop and he denied returning with them to Crossley's residence. He also denied receiving $2,000 but said he did receive about 30-40 ecstasy tablets as payment from Crossley about a week later. To the suggestion that at some stage during the communications Crossley told him that he (Crossley) and Cobb had committed a robbery at Heatherbrae Pies the applicant said that he did ""not quite remember"" but it was possible that that happened. He denied that ""during one of the telephone calls"" Crossley said, ""... we've just knocked over Heatherbrae Pies, what's happening on the scanner. Keep a listen out and ring us straight away if you hear anything"". He ""did not believe"" that in one of the calls Crossley suggested that there was a need to get rid of the stolen car so that he would not be arrested in it and he denied that he made an agreement with Crossley to meet him on a fire trail in the National Park and then met him there.

31In respect of count 2 the applicant denied meeting Crossley and his co-offenders after they committed the armed robbery and then transporting them from that location. He also denied receiving a sum of money from the proceeds of the armed robbery. He did not believe that Crossley telephoned him after he had committed the armed robbery and told him what he had done. From at least around 2008 until the date of his arrest he was using significant quantities of ecstasy, ice and cocaine as well as significant quantities of alcohol. 

32As will be apparent from my earlier remarks, there was no evidence led by the Crown to establish the facts it asserted in the dispute in relation to count 2.

The sentencing judge's findings

33In respect of count 1, her Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the account given by Cobb was correct and that the applicant drove the two men away after the stolen vehicle was set alight. Her Honour did not find that the applicant received any cash proceeds of the robbery, as Mr Cobb could not recall it and the applicant denied it, although admitting that he had received some ecstasy tablets about a week later (ROS 3.1).

34In respect of count 2, her Honour said (at ROS 4.2): 
""The offender denied in his evidence that he provided transport to the offenders and that he was given any money for his assistance. However when tested in cross-examination he agreed that he did have a poor memory of the event due to his drug and alcohol use over this period. His evidence does not cause me to have a reasonable doubt about those parts of the facts that were in dispute."" (Emphasis added)

The applicant's subjective case

35The applicant was born on 24 February 1981. He was 27 years old at the time of the offences and almost 30 years old when sentenced. A psychological assessment report from Ms Laura Durkin and a psychiatric report from Dr Olav Nielssen were tendered in evidence. 

36The applicant was the fourth of five children and appeared to have had a relatively stable upbringing. He reported some conflict with his father when younger, although he was close to his mother. During childhood he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder and a learning disability. He reported to Ms Durkin that he struggled academically and socially whilst at school and that he truanted regularly. He reported that he never learned to read satisfactorily and that his writing abilities were limited. The applicant ceased schooling after finishing Year 9, following a period of having been home schooled by his mother. He worked in a number of unskilled positions for some years. He had been unemployed since the age of 25 and prior to his arrest he had been in receipt of a disability support pension.

37The applicant reported that he struggled socially for much of his life and that he had few friends. He had been involved in a relationship for seven years and he had a daughter from that union who was born in 2004. The relationship ended in October 2008, shortly before the commission of the offences. The applicant told Dr Nielssen that he met Kirk Crossley shortly after the break down of the relationship. He told Ms Durkin that Crossley had been an overwhelming support to him at that time and that at one time Crossley had found him unconscious after a suicide attempt. He told Ms Durkin that he felt he could not refuse Crossley's request to monitor the scanners because of the support Crossley had provided.

38On 21 November 2008 the applicant was admitted briefly to a psychiatric hospital with suicidal ideation.

39Dr Nielssen diagnosed the applicant as having a substance abuse disorder and a depressive illness as well as the possibility of an underlying psychotic illness.

40Her Honour was satisfied that the applicant's emotional state following the break-up of his long term relationship and his resorting to illegal drugs and alcohol as a consequence contributed to his involvement in the offences. The six week period over which the offences were committed represented ""an unusual and alarming escalation in the applicant's involvement in serious criminal offences"" (ROS7.4). Her Honour also found that the applicant's mental illness at the time of the offences lessened his moral culpability (ROS 6).

Ground 1: In relation to the sentence imposed for Count 2, there was no sufficient evidence upon which her Honour could find that the appellant had engaged in the conduct comprising the factual dispute in relation to that Count.

41The Crown concedes that the sentencing judge made findings of fact with respect to count 2 which were not open to her on the evidence presented. The Crown accepts that there was an obligation on the Crown to prove the contested facts in relation to count 2 beyond reasonable doubt.

42The Crown, however, noted that during the discussion on 28 January 2011 her Honour had remarked that the contested facts might only ""marginally increase"" the applicant's criminality. However, this Court has held on a number of occasions that considerable caution has to be exercised concerning remarks made during argument or discussion and prior to sentencing: see, for example R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at [11]; R v Thompson [2005] NSWCCA 340; 156 A Crim R 467 at 474-475 [32]. Such remarks do not have the force of carefully considered findings made following upon the conclusion of the submissions. It is the judgment of the Court which ought to be considered for this purpose, and not exchanges between the Bench and counsel during the course of submissions. In the present matter, the contested facts must have had a reasonably significant effect on the assessment of criminality. The sentence imposed and the degree of accumulation involved demonstrated that this was so.

43In my opinion, the applicant has made out this ground of appeal and it will be necessary for the Court to re-sentence him.

Ground 2: The learned judge erred in law in declining to take into account in mitigation that the appellant had spent over 2 years on remand prior to sentence

44I am not satisfied that this ground has been established. It is true that the applicant gave evidence that whilst on remand he had been ""on some form of protection"". Apparently this followed upon an incident where he had been set upon by other inmates. The evidence was very vague however. It seems that the small amount of detail provided indicated that his custodial situation was, as his counsel conceded, ""obviously not the most restrictive"". The evidence disclosed that the applicant was released from his cell between the hours of 9am and 3pm most days, and that he had contact with about sixty other inmates in his pod. He has been able to undertake courses and training, and work within the prison system. Protective custody may only be taken into account where there is evidence that the conditions of imprisonment will be more onerous: RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147; 202 A Crim R 209 at [192]-[195].

Grounds 3, 4 and 5: 

45These grounds asserted that the sentence imposed in relation to count 1 was manifestly excessive; that the sentence in count 2 was manifestly excessive; and that her Honour erred in the accumulation of sentences imposed, resulting in a situation where the ultimate sentence constituted, in effect, totally cumulative sentences.

46In view of the finding I have made in relation to count 2 and of the need to re-sentence the applicant, it is not necessary to say anything about these grounds, other than that I do not consider that the sentence imposed on count 1 has been shown to be manifestly excessive. The maximum penalty applicable to count 1 is fourteen years imprisonment. The sentence imposed was a small fraction of the maximum penalty. None of the matters pointed to by the applicant in his submissions suggested that the sentence on count 1 fell outside the sound range of a proper discretionary exercise.

47In view of the need to re-sentence the applicant, it is unnecessary to determine ground 5. In my opinion, however, the process of partial accumulation adopted by the sentencing judge has not been demonstrated to be erroneous, assuming, however, that the sentence on count 2 was warranted. Because of the error involved, it will be necessary for this Court to reconsider the questions of accumulation and concurrency in the light of the totality principle and other relevant considerations.

Re-sentence

48In my opinion, an appropriate sentence for count 2, having regard to the seriousness of the offence and the applicant's substantial subjective case, is imprisonment for ten months with the sentence to be partially accumulated on the sentence imposed in count 1.

49The Court has received an affidavit from the applicant which suggests quite forcefully that he has made considerable efforts to improve his situation while in custody. He has worked hard to overcome his illiteracy and has been working as a leading hand in the kitchen for the last few months. He has completed the ""Getting Smart"" programme successfully and is undertaking the CALM programme at the present time. The applicant is hopeful that, upon release, he will be able to reside with his parents in Queensland and be supervised by Queensland probation and parole. He says that his parents have been very supportive while he has been in custody, and they have offered him the opportunity not only to live with them but to obtain work locally once he is back with them.

50If this arrangement does not work out for any reason, the applicant suggests that he may be able to live with his brother, his wife and their children in Mt Hutton. It is apparent that successful rehabilitation is within the applicant's reach, although it will require him to free himself from drugs and, if it is possible, to obtain some worthwhile and satisfying work.

51As did the sentencing judge, I would find special circumstances in the last sentence both because of the proposed accumulation of sentences, and because the applicant will obviously benefit from a longer period on parole under supervision.

52In relation to count 4, I take into account, as did the sentencing judge, the five matters on the Form 1.

53The consequence of all this is that the applicant should be re-sentenced as follows:

Count 1: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 15 months to commence from 10 December 2008 and to expire on 9 March 2010.

Count 2: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 10 months to commence from 10 August 2009 and to expire on 9 June 2010.

Count 3: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 months to commence from 10 August 2009 and to expire on 9 October 2009.

Count 4: A term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years to commence from 10 June 2010 and to expire on 9 June 2012 with a balance of term 2 years and 3 months to expire on 9 September 2014.

54The total effect of sentence will now be one of imprisonment for 5 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. The applicant will be eligible for parole on 9 June 2012.

55The orders I propose are:

(1) Extension of time for leave to appeal granted.

(2) Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

(3) Sentence imposed by the sentencing judge on 11 February 2011 be set aside and in lieu thereof the following sentences imposed:

Count 1: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 15 months to commence from 10 December 2008 and to expire on 9 March 2010.

Count 2: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 10 months to commence from 10 August 2009 and to expire on 9 June 2010.

Count 3: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 months to commence from 10 August 2009 and to expire on 9 October 2009.

Count 4: A term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years to commence from 10 June 2010 and to expire on 9 June 2012 with a balance of term 2 years and 3 months to expire on 9 September 2014.

56HIDDEN J: I agree with Whealy JA.

57SCHMIDT J: I agree with Whealy JA.

2759245,Peden v Ferguson [2012] NSWSC 492,"Judgment
Introduction
1James Peden claims damages in negligence against Dr Michael Ferguson, a general practitioner, for failing to take appropriate action following a consultation on 18 September 2007 which would have led to an earlier diagnosis of sacral chordoma, a terminal cancer which is likely to bring his life to an early end.
2Sacral chordoma is a very rare form of malignant bone tumour, which occurs in the sacrum. Chordomas are slow-growing tumours which often present late with symptoms of pressure on adjacent structures.
3The plaintiff consulted the defendant as his general practitioner from 1988. The plaintiff also consulted other medical practitioners, including Dr Hashmi, Dr Mohammadi, Dr Ishola, Dr Roy, Dr Acland and Dr Alarape, who were general practitioners and Dr Fowler, a physician.
Issue for determination
4The issues in the case have largely been resolved by agreement. The one remaining issue for me to determine is whether the plaintiff complained of altered sensation and feelings of electric shocks in his legs in the consultation on 18 September 2007.
5The plaintiff's case is that on 18 September 2007, in addition to other complaints, he complained to the defendant of constant and severe pain in the coccyx area in his low back and between his buttocks together with altered sensation and feelings of electric shocks in his legs.
6The defendant's case is that on 18 September 2007 the plaintiff complained only of lower back pain in his coccyx, sacroilial joint pain and low range tinnitus and did not complain of altered sensation and feelings of electric shocks in his legs.
7The plaintiff's case is largely reliant on his recollection and his diaries. The defendant's case is substantially reliant on his clinical notes and other medical records of the defendant and other practitioners.
8It has been agreed that if the plaintiff's case is accepted, the defendant was negligent and the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the sum of $400,000 plus costs. It has been agreed that if the plaintiff's case is not accepted, the defendant is entitled to judgment in his favour. 
Evidence
9The parties tendered an agreed bundle of documents which contained:
(1)A chronology;
(2)Two affidavits of the plaintiff sworn 17 October 2011 and 7 December 2011 respectively; 
(3)A transcript of evidence given by the plaintiff on commission on 13 December 2011;
(4)A statement by the defendant in answer to interrogatories;
(5)A witness statement by the defendant made in March 2012;
(6)The defendant's clinical records;
(7)The clinical records of the Charlestown Medical & Dental practice;
(8)The clinical records of Dr Hashmi; and
(9)Expert reports including a joint report of an expert conclave.
10The expert reports are no longer relevant, except by way of background, because of the agreement between the parties set out above.
11The plaintiff tendered two diaries, one coloured green (for the financial year 2007-2008) and the other coloured red (for the financial year 2008-2009), the relevant pages of which were photocopied and tendered separately. The defendant tendered his curriculum vitae and a page from the appointment book of his practice for 18 September 2007.
12Both the plaintiff and the defendant gave oral evidence before me and were cross-examined.  Their credibility is the principal issue in these proceedings.
13It is important, for the purposes of assessing the credibility of the parties to make an assessment of the objective probabilities of each version. As the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ) said in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at [31], the best guide on which to reason to my conclusions is to do so:
""...on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events.""
The facts
14The chronology, as it appears from contemporaneous clinical records and incontrovertible facts, is as follows.
Chronology of events from contemporaneous clinical records and incontrovertible facts
15The plaintiff contracted Reiter's syndrome in South Africa in October 1973. Reiter's syndrome is a form of reactive arthritis triggered by either a sexually transmitted or gastrointestinal infection. It generally affects the larger joints such as the ankle and knee as well as commonly causing sacroiliitis (inflammation of the sacroiliac joints) which presents as chronic low back pain.
16On 18 September 2007, the plaintiff consulted the defendant for diagnosis and treatment of certain symptoms which included low back pain in the coccyx. The defendant's clinical note records:
""Low back pain with coccyx pain. Low range tinnitus. SI [sacroiliac] joint pain.""
17Following the consultation the defendant referred the plaintiff for a bone scan at the Hunter Health Imaging Service.
18On 27 September 2007, the plaintiff underwent a bone scan which indicated a mild increased uptake in the right sacroiliac joint and mild prominence in the tracer uptake in a linear distribution in the sacrum. The defendant regarded the results as being consistent with Reiter's syndrome.
19On 8 October 2007 the plaintiff was seen by Dr Fowler, a physician and diabetologist, who reported on the consultation in a letter to the defendant dated the same day. Dr Fowler made a positive diagnosis of obsessive personality, Reiter's syndrome and associated polyarthritis. The letter concludes:
""You will understand Michael [the defendant] that by the time I went through his 'green book' [the plaintiff's diary] and through all of this detail I did not have time to perform a physical examination. I intend to review him in a further 10 days.""
20Dr Fowler neither refers to, nor records, any complaint of altered sensation in the lower legs or pain in the testicles.
21On 18 October 2007, the plaintiff saw Dr Fowler again for the examination foreshadowed on 8 October 2007. In his letter of the same date to the defendant he reported:
""I completed a full physical examination on James today.  I found no obvious organic cause for his breathlessness with a normal FVC, FeV1 ratio.  Heart sounds were essentially normally with a Grade 1/6 localised systolic murmur of no significance.  He had no cardiomegaly, no gallop rhythm, no signs of left or right heart failure.
He has a right testicle that is partly retracted, his left testicle felt normal.  He has normal body distribution of hair although his axillary hair was somewhat reduced...
I have organised a series of blood tests in an attempt to give James more complete reassurance that he does not have severe ongoing disease...
Summary:  Following a fully physical examination there is a very low probability of major organic disease apart from those previously defined.  I will review his results and further communicate with you.""
22Dr Fowler neither refers to, nor records, any complaint of altered sensation in the lower legs or pain in the testicles.
23In or about November 2007, the defendant was served with a subpoena to produce his medical records in proceedings brought by the plaintiff in the Motor Accidents List of Newcastle District Court.
24On 6 March 2008, the plaintiff cancelled an appointment with the defendant.
25By letter dated 10 March 2008, Dr Fowler wrote to the plaintiff about treatment options for a benign pituitary tumour in his pituitary gland and recommended that the plaintiff take Cabergoline rather than have surgery or irradiation. Once again, Dr Fowler neither referred to, nor recorded, any complaint of altered sensation in the lower legs or pain in the testicles.
26On 25 July 2008, the plaintiff returned to see the defendant, whom he had not seen since September 2007. The defendant's clinical note records:
""Chronic lower lumbar back pain. Requesting injection. CT ordered.""
27The defendant did not record any complaint of coccyx pain.
28The CT was performed on 28 July 2008. Mild degenerative changes were identified as well as mild diffuse lumbar scoliosis, convex to the right.
29On 11 August 2008, the plaintiff consulted Dr Hashmi, who recorded the following matters in his clinical notes:
""(1) The plaintiff had seen Dr Fowler for his general health;
(2) Pituitary macroadonoma;
(3) Testosterone levels had increased; sex drive and energy levels had improved;
(4) Cholesterol had reduced from 6.8 in April 2008 to 4.8 on Simvastatin [an anti-cholesterol drug];
(5) ECHO- mild dietetic dysfunction;
(6) Retinal tears (Dr. Hollenbach);
(7) Muscle ache and wasting of muscles
(8) Low fat diet/ exercise""
30On 14 August 2008, the plaintiff consulted Dr Mohammadi for the first time. Dr Mohammadi's clinical notes recorded:
""Suffering from a pain in the coccyx area for a longer term, nil falls or injury. Has been on Simvastatin, had muscle wasting, has stopped, needs a lipid profile check up.OE [on examination]: General app normal, heart 2x, chest clear, BP 124/70.""
31Diagnoses of pituitary adenoma, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia were noted. Panadeine Forte was prescribed and various blood tests were ordered.
32On 19 August 2008, the plaintiff consulted the defendant again. The defendant's clinical notes record:
""No relief with L & R injection. Claims legs are numb, muscle wasting (which he believes is due to Simvastatin). Nerve conduction studies ordered.""
33On 25 August 2008, the plaintiff saw a Dr Ishola, a general practitioner in the same practice as Dr Mohammadi. Dr Ishola recorded that he discussed the results of the blood tests; that the plaintiff's blood pressure was 110/49.  He recorded that they also discussed the plaintiff's concern about his right thigh, which was felt to be an adverse reaction to Simvastatin. Dr Ishola recorded that he reassured the plaintiff about the recent facet joint injection.
34On 12 September 2008, the plaintiff saw Dr Roy who practises in the same practice as Dr Mohammadi. Dr Roy recorded that he gave the plaintiff a script for Panadeine Forte for back pain. The plaintiff's blood pressure was 106/60. He complained of pain and tenderness in his left lower chest and gave a history of hiatus hernia. He mentioned musculoskeletal pain and shortness of breath. He gave a history of diastolic dysfunction which had been investigated before. Dr Roy recorded that he told the plaintiff to follow these matters up with his usual general practitioner.
35On 25 September 2008 the plaintiff saw Dr Acland, another general practitioner in the same practice as Dr Mohammadi. Panadeine Forte was prescribed; his height and weight were measured and his BMI calculated; and his blood pressure tested at 120/80. Dr Acland also recorded:
""(R) sciatic pain past 2 months, under care of Dr Michael Ferguson who is sending pt for nerve conduction studies.
Requests panadeine forte until cause of pain identified and definite treatment arranged.
Weight loss of 15 kgs and wasting of proximal muscle- ? due to simvastatin prescribed by Dr Fowler for hyperlipidaemia. Pt has ceased medication, against Dr Fowler's recommendation.
Pt advised to seek 2nd opinon re Simvastatin- to make appt with Dr Silberberg or Dr Nikelotatis and return for referral.""
36The nerve conduction studies that the defendant had recommended the plaintiff undergo on 19 August 2008 were carried out on 10 October 2008 by Dr Katekar. The report stated that there was no indication of denervation or myopathy but that an absent reflex may indicate lumbar nerve root disease.
37On 14 October 2008, the plaintiff saw Dr Fowler again. He reported pain in his coccyx, numbness in his right upper thigh and right testicular pain.
38On 23 October 2008, the plaintiff consulted the defendant again. The defendant's clinical notes record:
""James feels statins are responsible for his muscle wasting R leg. Trial Lipidil. Reports numbness in distribution of R L4 which dates from time of cortisone injection. Referred Dr M. Edger specialist.""
39On 22 November 2008, the plaintiff saw Dr Alarape, another doctor in Dr Mohammadi's practice, who recorded:
""Recurrent lower back pain for years
Needs his panadeine forte and said he attends an ortho specialist
And has had intra-articular cortisone
Will be going for MRI at jhh [John Hunter Hospital] in 3 weeks- Dr Michael Edger
Not in distress
Script done for Panadeine Forte
Do x-ray L/S [lumbar sacral] spine to appraise the L/S spine condition
Do tests
R/t for results asap""
40On 2 December 2008 the plaintiff saw Dr Kazemi, a neurosurgical registrar in Outpatients at John Hunter Hospital. An examination was performed and a MRI recommended. Dr Kazemi reported the results of the consultation that same day in a letter to the defendant.
41On 9 January 2009 the plaintiff was diagnosed with a sacral chordoma approximately 10 centimetres in diameter in the right buttock in the region of the S4 sacral segment as well as the coccyx with extension into the presacral space.
The plaintiff's version of events
42The narrative set out below is derived from the plaintiff's affidavit evidence, evidence on commission and his oral evidence in the hearing before me, together with his diary entries.
43The plaintiff's evidence was that, in early 2007, he developed symptoms including constant, severe pain in the coccyx area in his lower back and between his buttocks together with altered sensation and feelings of electric shocks in his legs, which also affected his testicles. The pain in his coccyx was ""like sitting on a knife"". The pain grew worse with exertion up hills or stairs. These symptoms were very different from those he had experienced before. In about May or June 2007, he noticed an obvious large swelling protruding from the back of his pelvis.
44Notwithstanding the severity of the pain and symptoms described above, the plaintiff did not consult either of his two general practitioners, the defendant or Dr Hashmi, about it until he saw the defendant on 18 September 2007. He said that he did not consult anyone because he thought that the pain would ""just pass"".
45The plaintiff's evidence was that on 18 September 2007 he consulted the defendant and described the following symptoms:
""I have excruciating pain in the tailbone at the base of my spine and down my leg.  I can't walk up slopes or stairs due to the pain.  Even when I sit in a soft chair I feel the pain in the tailbone.  My right leg feels numb and I have pins and needles and I feel at times that I can't control my right leg when I walk.  I feel electric jolts in my right leg and right buttock.  I also feel frequent sharp stabbing pain like an electrical shock in my testicles.""
46The plaintiff said that the defendant responded:
""That's ball pain. I get it. Don't worry about it.""
47When it was put to the plaintiff, during cross-examination, that he did not complain of testicular pain on 18 September 2007, he maintained:
""I remember it as clear as I'm sitting here today, and I remember his [the defendant's] response, 'That's ball pain. I get it. Don't worry about it.' And actually I recall him laughing.""
48The plaintiff also said that he told the defendant that he was concerned that he had a nerve problem. He said that the defendant did not examine him at all during that consultation. When it was put to the plaintiff that the defendant palpated his lower back and the coccyx area by gently pressing it, he denied that it, or any other examination, had occurred. In later questions, he said that he did not recall such examination.
49The plaintiff gave evidence that on the evening of 18 September 2007 he made a diary entry that recorded what had occurred in the consultation.  His evidence and the diary entry are addressed further below.
50The plaintiff gave evidence that the defendant told him, when he rang one of the two phone lines to the defendant's rooms from a public phone after the bone scan, that there was no abnormality on the scan.
51The plaintiff's evidence was: 
""These symptoms continued and grew worse over time to the point in late 2008 that I had occasional problems driving a car due to altered sensation in my feet and difficulties with walking up hills.""
52The plaintiff's consultations with Dr Fowler on 8 and 18 October 2007 were not mentioned in his affidavit evidence. The diary entry for 8 October 2007 is referred to below in the separate consideration of diary entries. The diary entry for 18 October 2007, in its entirety, reads:
""Noon: 12.00 DR FOWLER ($85-) TAKE $200. 30 [address] (Ph. [phone number])
Dr Fowler wants me to ring his secretary to make appt. 8-10 days after last of three tests have been done. Check to see if all results received before making appt.""
53The plaintiff explained that he did not see the defendant for another ten months, until July 2008, because he had ""lost some trust in him"". However, he admitted that he did not see any other general practitioner in that period.  The plaintiff did not give any satisfactory explanation for the alleged loss of trust.
54There is a brief notation in the plaintiff's diary of his appointment with the defendant on 6 March 2008 (which the defendant noted was cancelled) which reads:
""FERGUSON- WHAT IS IN INJECTION?- WILL IT CONFLICT WITH RAMPRIL/ SIMVASTATIN. I'M ALLERGIC TO SULPHUR-BSED DRUGS.""
55When asked about a consultation with the defendant on 25 July 2008, the plaintiff said:
""I can't recall that particular one in my memory bank and bring it up exactly, no.""
56There is no entry in the plaintiff's diary for 25 July 2008.
57In his affidavit of 7 December 2011 he deposed, with respect to the consultation with the defendant on 25 July 2008:
""I informed him of the symptoms that I had experienced since 2007. In addition I remember saying words to the effect: ""These symptoms are not the same as the sacroiliitis which I have experienced in the past. This is life-changing pain and something has to be done.""
58The plaintiff was only ""very, very vaguely"" able to recall a consultation with Dr Mohammadi on 14 August 2008. There is a brief entry in his diary for that day which relevantly reads:
""Blood pressure 124/70- started Panadeine Forte ~ tabs ea 6 hours when necessary.""
59When asked about a consultation with the defendant on 19 August 2008, the plaintiff said that he could not remember the specifics of it. He said:
""the only one I can remember specifically in detail is the very first one in September '07.""
60The plaintiff's diary records for that day, 19 August 2008:
""APPT FERGUSON- 12.00
Want pain in lumbar spine fixed
- C/TOWN doctor said need pain manager.""
61The plaintiff was unable to recall a consultation with Dr Ishola on 25 August 2008, with Dr Roy on 12 September 2008 or with Dr Acland on 25 September 2008.
62A page from the plaintiff's green diary which covers the period from 22 to 28 August 2008 has been removed. I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence that it is not uncommon for him to remove pages from his diary, particularly where they contain matters concerning his university studies. I infer that the contents of the missing pages would not have assisted the plaintiff.
63In respect of the consultation with Dr Roy on 12 September 2008 the plaintiff did not deny that it had occurred. He said in his evidence on commission:
""But look, if it's down there [recorded in the clinical notes], no doubt I - I went there.""
64The plaintiff said, in cross-examination in his evidence on commission, that he did recall seeing the defendant in October 2008, although he did not refer to any such consultation in either of his affidavits.
65The plaintiff did not recall anything about the consultation on 22 November 2008 with Dr Alarape apart from the x-ray of the lumbar spine, which he said in his evidence on commission ""rings a bell"".
66When the appointment with Dr Kazemi on 2 December 2008 was put to the plaintiff in his evidence on commission, he said it was ""very vague to me"".
The plaintiff's diaries
67During the course of giving evidence on commission, the plaintiff made mention of diary entries and said:
""I kept diaries for 90 per cent of everyone I saw, regardless of whether it was Dr Ferguson or anyone else... The rest came from memory.""
""Most of the things came from my diary and some of it came from recall through memory.""
68When asked in evidence on commission why there was a reference in his affidavit to a consultation with the defendant in July 2008, when he did not recall such a consultation he said:
""...because it would be in my diary. I'd bank on that... Because I was keeping a lot of diary entries. As things got worse, I kept entries of what was going on...
I would have to go to my diary even to verify that I went to him.""
69A formal call was made for the diaries during evidence on commission on 13 December 2011. The diaries were not available that day but they were subsequently produced. The plaintiff was cross-examined about the entries for the following dates at the hearing before me:
(1) 18 September 2007;
(2) 8 October 2007;
(3) 18 October 2007;
(4) 6 March 2008;
(5) 25 July 2008 (lack of entry);
(6) 11 August 2008;
(7) 19 August 2008; and
(8) 13 October 2008. 
70There are references in the narrative of the plaintiff's evidence above to some of the diary entries. Those of particular relevance are considered in the reasons below.
Diary entry for 18 September 2007
71Because the single issue which now remains in the case concerns the consultation between the plaintiff and the defendant on 18 September 2007, the most significant diary entry for the plaintiff is the diary entry for that date. There is a real dispute about whether what was written on that page is contemporaneous, or was included later, or whether it is a mixture of both. The plaintiff's evidence is that he probably wrote it on the evening of 18 September 2007 because he tends to make notes in the evening of the important things that have happened during the day.
72Because of the importance of the note, I shall set it out in full:
""12.00 (MICHAEL FERGUSON.) - if not sooner1) Pain in testicles - started approx. 6 months ago. - disappeared then reappeared - sharp, stabbing pain. - in right testicle?2) Fluid in legs, pain in legs walking up slopes,  fluid at top of behind & pain in coccyx when walking up hills.- a doctor said fluid in middle ear/possible nerve damage in ear of fluid in legs and base of spine all related - said didn't need fluid tablets at that stage - see my doctor in Jan 07 (dripping/loud ticking in left ear) is still prevalent at night when in bed.3) Tightness in chest & dry cough.4) frequent urination. (sometimes every few minutes.)5) where can I get my arm/elbow fixed - straightened? 6) Palpitations - heart.""
73One of the more salient features of the entry is that a portion has been cut out. Part of the portion that was cut out has been re-inserted on the page and stuck in with adhesive tape. When the plaintiff was asked about the cut out portion he said:
""I cut that out shortly after I had written it, in fact straight after I had written it because I needed the information on the back of it.""
74The information on the back of the entry was the name and address of a person in France, but this portion was on the piece that was stuck back into the diary and appears on the page for the previous day, 17 September 2007. However when it was put to the plaintiff that he had cut out a portion of the 18 September 2007 entry because he did not think it would assist his case if it remained he said that he received a phone call while he was writing and he put the personal note relating to the phone call at the end of the entry for the consultation. Ultimately he agreed that the cut out portion was not at the end of the entry.
75The plaintiff was adamant that all notes in his diary were contemporaneous. When it was put to him that he had used different pens in the same entry he said:
""The pen was just the one that was to hand because I've never gone back and written things after the event."" [Emphasis added]
76The inference that the plaintiff used the diary to refresh his recollection of what had occurred (which would arise if I accept his evidence on commission that his account of events is based both on the diary and on his oral recollection) is not open given the important disparities between the diary entry and his evidence. In particular, the diary entry makes no mention of altered sensation in the right leg and foot; loss of control of movement in his right leg; or the feeling of electric shock in the right leg, buttock or the testicles. The affidavit makes no mention of frequent urination.
77The plaintiff rejected the suggestion put to him in cross-examination that where complaints were not included in his diary, it is likely that he did not make them to Dr Ferguson. This evidence is inconsistent with his evidence on commission which indicated that he was reliant on his diary to assist his recollection.
Diary entry for 8 October 2007
78The diary entry for 8 October 2007 contains a list of 13 numbered items, the seventh of which is:
""Severe pain in coccyx and swelling (fluid) at top of behind + tinnitus in left ear (dripping tap) and fluid in legs & ankles & back (lower)""
79There is no reference in the list to altered sensation in his right foot and leg, loss of control of his right foot or sensations of electric shock in his right leg, buttock and testicles. 
80I find it glaringly improbable that had the plaintiff been suffering such symptoms at the time he saw Dr Fowler he would not have included them in his list and told Dr Fowler of them. Given the absence of the relevant symptoms from the list, it is probable that he was not suffering from them either on 8 October 2007 or three weeks earlier on 18 September 2007 when he saw the defendant.
Diary entry for 11 August 2008
81 The plaintiff's diary entry for 11 August 2008 reads, in its entirety:
""From approximately today I have experienced a numbness (partial paralysis) of right testicle, penis, right groin, buttocks and right leg- little interest in sex- difficulty getting erection.""
82The contents of this entry are to be contrasted with the history Dr Hashmi recorded of the consultation on 11 August 2008 that the plaintiff's testosterone levels had increased and his sex drive and energy levels had improved. It is, in my view, inconceivable that the plaintiff would not have told Dr Hashmi of the symptoms recorded in the diary note if he had been experiencing them on that day and that he would have given the history recorded by Dr Hashmi in that event. I infer from the disparity that the diary entry for 11 August 2008 is not contemporaneous. This inference is supported by the use of the words ""From approximately today"" which are more suggestive of an appreciation of relevance in hindsight rather than prescience of relevance.
Diary entry for 13-14 October 2008
83There is an entry in the plaintiff's diary which runs from the top of 13 October 2008 to the bottom of 14 October 2008. It reads, in its entirety:
""SEE FOWLER - TIME?10.30 AM?MEDICATION CURRENT:- CABERGOLINE/RAMPRIL/CO-ENZYME 110/MACU-VISIONStopped Simvastatin  13/08/08 started taking panadeine forte (2-4 per day.)  Will I take ramipril for life?  When can I stop cabergoline?  When is next brain scan?6/8/08.  Had injection in L5 facet joints - pain worse & more widespread - can't sit or walk far.Ask Fowler about pain (sharp) in right testicle, occasionally left - usually when in bed at night - want examined.  Ferguson said don't worry about it. Need more panadeine forte (50 tablets).* Results of blood tests.* still short of breath* no appetite.* Protein supplement?  How long can I take Panadeine forte?""
84When it was put to the plaintiff that the note was not contemporaneous his denial was unequivocal:
""Q. It is likely, is it not, you have gone back and put that in as a consequence of the proceedings you commenced against Dr Ferguson to make your case look further better than it was?  
A. No, because after the event I don't go and alter it things.  I have never done that.  It's not my nature.  The diary is what it is.""
85There are several indications that this note is not contemporaneous. It relates to consultation on 14 October 2008 and yet the entry begins on 13 October 2008. The question mark indicates a lack of certainty about the time of the appointment which also suggests that it was written later, when the plaintiff could no longer recall at what time and on what day he had seen Dr Fowler. The plaintiff's evidence, that the note that the defendant told him not to worry about sharp pain in his right testicle relates back to the consultation on 18 September 2007, is implausible. It accords great significance to the consultation on 18 September 2007 when, at that time, no diagnosis of sacral chordoma had been made and there was, accordingly, no reason for the plaintiff to attribute to that consultation the significance that the he now does. Furthermore there is no reason why the plaintiff would insert this detail in a consultation more than a year after he now says that the comment was made.
86I find that this note was not contemporaneous. It is probable that it was made after the diagnosis of sacral chordoma in January 2009. 
The defendant's evidence in response to the plaintiff's version of events
87As at September 2007, the defendant was a sole practitioner in a very busy general practice at Broadmeadow. He had closed off his books some years previously to new patients, but made an exception for relatives of established patients. His wife was the practice manager and his daughter worked as the receptionist. He employed a practice nurse for one day a week. There was a single phone line into the practice.
88The defendant's recollection of what was and was not given by way of history by the plaintiff on 18 September 2007 is set out above. The practice appointment book recorded that the consultation started at 12.05 pm and concluded at 12.30 or 12.35 pm. It was, by the Medicare definition, a long consultation.
89The defendant gave evidence that he made a thorough examination of the plaintiff's back. He said that he asked the plaintiff to keep his clothes on and tested for tenderness while the plaintiff was both in a standing and face-down position. He checked the plaintiff's range of movement and reflexes. He did not make a diagnosis that day but referred the plaintiff for a bone scan. He said that his examination of the plaintiff and understanding of his symptoms led him to believe that the plaintiff was experiencing a flare-up of Reiter's syndrome. He considered a bone scan to be the best investigative tool for an inflammatory disease of that nature. He filled in a bone scan referral form and sent it off.
90The defendant denied that the plaintiff made complaints of pain or altered sensation in his legs, pins and needles or electric shocks in his right leg and right buttock or pain or the feeling of electrical shock in his testicles. He said that had the plaintiff done so he would have ordered a CT scan, which tends to show nerve entrapment, rather than a bone scan which does not.
91The defendant vehemently denied that he had said the words the plaintiff attributed to him about ""ball pain"". He said in evidence:
""I never discuss my personal medical complaints with patients and, for the purpose of this discussion, it's not an area of concern on my part.""
92The defendant also said that he had never come across a case of ""sharp stabbing pain like an electric shock in testicles"" apart from as a result of trauma and had never encountered numbness in testicles. He observed that the testicle nerve supply is provided at the higher levels of the lumbar spine, through L1-L2, and migrates through the pelvis through the inguinal canal which is in front. His evidence was:
""I cannot see any anatomical connection between his disease process and what he allegedly complained of.""
93At the conclusion of the consultation the defendant said that, because of the demands of his practice, he told the plaintiff that he would only contact him about the results of the bone scan if he had any concerns about the results.
94When the defendant received the bone scan in late September or early October 2007 he considered that it was consistent with the plaintiff's clinical presentation of sacroiliitis and consistent with Reiter's disease. To the extent that it recorded increased uptake in certain areas it was evidence of previous trauma, since a bone scan depicts old injuries and ""has a long memory"".
95The defendant said that his rooms had only one phone line and that he did not speak to the plaintiff about the bone scan. He said that his usual practice was only to contact a patient if an investigation was abnormal. He did not regard the results of the plaintiff's bone scan as abnormal because it was consistent with Reiter's syndrome.  He denied that he spoke to the plaintiff about the results.
96The defendant gave evidence that, consistent with his usual practice, he examined the plaintiff on 25 July 2008 and checked his range of movement, tenderness and reflexes. Following the consultation he referred the plaintiff for a CT scan and, if appropriate, a CT-guided L5/S1 facet joint injection to relieve pain in his lower back. He considered a CT scan to be the next diagnostic option after the bone scan which had not been particularly conclusive.
97The defendant gave evidence that he examined the plaintiff on 19 August 2008 in accordance with his usual practice. The plaintiff's complaints of numb legs and muscle wasting caused the defendant to refer him to a neurologist for nerve conduction studies.
98The defendant gave evidence that he saw and examined the plaintiff on 23 October 2008 in accordance with his usual practice. He considered that he had exhausted all available diagnostic tools apart from a MRI which Medicare prohibits general practitioners from referring. In order to overcome the prohibition, the defendant referred the plaintiff to Dr Edger, a neurosurgeon.
The ""credibility"" of the clinical records of medical practitioners
99The plaintiff submitted that the contemporaneous clinical records are, themselves, unreliable.  This submission encompassed all clinical records, and not merely those of the defendant.
100It is important, in my view, to appreciate the significance of clinical records. which are intended to record matters which are salient from a medical point of view. The following passage from Hope JA's judgment in Albrighton v Royal Prince Alfred Hospital [1980] 2 NSWLR 542 at 548-549 is a convenient articulation of why the admissibility of such records is ""of great importance in the search for truth"":
""Any significant organization in our society must depend for its efficient carrying on upon proper records made by persons who have no interest other than to record as accurately as possible matters relating to the business with which they are concerned. In the every-day carrying on of the activities of the business, people would look to, and depend upon, those records, and use them on the basis that they are most probably accurate. This position applies to hospitals, as to any other form of business; indeed, hospital records provide an excellent example of the basis, and of the usefulness, of Pt IIC [of the Evidence Act 1898]. If a busy honorary such as the second respondent wished to remind himself what the appellant's precise problem or medical condition was, or to learn what had happened since he last saw her, he would undoubtedly refer to the records, and would act upon the basis that they were correct. If, for some reason, a new honorary had to take over the case, it is to the records that he would go to find out what had happened or what he had to do. No doubt mistakes may occur in the making of records, but I would think they occur no more, and probably less often, than in the recollection of persons trying to describe what happened at some time in the past. When what is recorded is the activity of a business in relation to a particular person amongst thousands of persons, the records are likely to be a far more reliable source of truth than memory. They are often the only source of truth.""
101I consider the clinical records of medical practitioners to be the most reliable evidence in these proceedings. There is no doubt that each was contemporaneous in that they were made in the course of each consultation with the plaintiff. Furthermore they were made by persons who had, at the time the record was created, no interest in doing other than making a record of what had occurred. While many criticisms were made of the defendant's records, which are addressed in more detail below, the effect of the criticisms were that his records were incomplete or insufficiently comprehensive, rather than that what he recorded was incorrect.
102The evidence summarised in chronology set out above is, in my view, the most powerful evidence that the plaintiff did not complain to the defendant on 18 September 2007 of altered sensation or the feeling of electric shocks in his legs.
The plaintiff's credibility
103The plaintiff impressed me as a man who believed that he was telling the truth, but was not in fact doing so. He was adamant about certain things, which I do not accept to be true. For example:
(1) His evidence that he did not ever go back and write anything in his diary after the event was, in my view, contradicted by the entries of 18 September 2007 and 11 August 2008. 
(2) He was definite that the ""green book"" remained in his house at all times and that he had never taken it to a doctor's appointment, and yet he was ultimately forced to concede that he had taken it with him when he saw Dr Fowler on 8 October 2007. 
(3) His evidence on commission was to the effect that he was dependent on his diary for many matters and yet the crucial symptoms which he would have me believe he told the defendant on 18 September 2007 do not appear in the diary entry for that day.
(4) His evidence that as his symptoms got worse he made more diary entries is not borne out by the diaries themselves, where the most detailed entry of what purportedly happened is for the 18 September 2007. Many consultations in 2008 had no diary entries at all, or none that recorded much beyond the time and place of the appointment.
104I do not accept the plaintiff's recollection of the18 September 2007 consultation. The consultation was one of many consultations about which he was asked questions but it is the only one that the plaintiff purports to remember well. He has little, if any, recollection of consultations that occurred considerably later. This tells against his credibility.
105Furthermore, if the plaintiff's evidence that he wrote the entry for 18 September 2007 that night were true, then the detailed entry would have been in the diary when he took it with him to Dr Fowler on 8 October 2007 with his list of complaints to impart and discuss. It is unlikely that, had he taken the trouble to document in such extraordinary detail what had occurred on 18 September 2007, he would not have related it to Dr Fowler on 8 October 2007, particularly in circumstances where the consultation on 8 October 2007 was, as appears from Dr Fowler's letter reporting to the defendant, entirely devoted to taking a history from the plaintiff. This is particularly so, in light of the plaintiff's evidence that, for some unexplained reason, he had lost trust in the defendant at that time.
106I do not consider the plaintiff to have provided a satisfactory explanation of the portion of the entry for 18 September 2007 that remains cut out. It is an open question whether it contained something detrimental to his case. Whether the missing portion contained something which betrayed its lack of contemporaneity is a matter which is not resolved by the evidence. I infer, however, in light of what I find to be an unsatisfactory explanation for its removal, that its inclusion would not have assisted the plaintiff's case.
107I do not accept the plaintiff's submission that his diaries operated as an aide-memoire. While it is true that the plaintiff cannot be criticised for not keeping notes of consultations since, unlike the defendant, he had no obligation to do so, it tells against his credit that he has endeavoured to use his diary entry for 18 September 2007 to give verisimilitude to his evidence about what occurred, when it was not contemporaneous.
108The defendant's unchallenged evidence is that in or about November 2007 he was served with a subpoena in unrelated proceedings brought by the plaintiff in the District Court. The significance of this evidence was not explored at the hearing. However it establishes that the plaintiff at least had the opportunity to have access to the defendant's clinical notes of the consultation on 18 September 2007. When the light of hindsight was shone by the subsequent diagnosis of sacral chordoma on the consultation of 18 September 2007, it is possible that the plaintiff may have inferred from his complaint of pain in the coccyx that he had in fact given a much more detailed history which could have led to an earlier diagnosis. The evidence does not permit me to make a finding on the balance of probabilities.
109I consider the following passage of McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 to be particularly apposite to the plaintiff's evidence in the instant case. His Honour said, at 319:
""...human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said.  All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed.  All this is a matter of ordinary human experience.""
110Lord Pearce's dictum in Onassis v Vergottis [1968] 2 Lloyds Rep 403 at 431 is also instructive. I consider that the highlighted passages are apposite to the plaintiff's credibility in the instant case:
""'Credibility' involves wider problems than mere 'demeanour' which is mostly concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now believes it to be... Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, who think that they are morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. For that reason a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present recollection is preferable to that which was taken down in writing immediately after the accident occurred. Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance. And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that, is it so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken? On this point it is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the credibility of a witness. And motive is one aspect of probability. All these problems compendiously are entailed when a Judge assesses the credibility of a witness; they are all part of one judicial process. And in the process contemporary documents and admitted or incontrovertible facts and probabilities must play their proper part."" [Emphasis added]
111It was my impression that the plaintiff's changes in version were affected by motive, self-interest and wishful thinking.  He was a man obsessed with his own health, bodily functions and symptoms. He may have regarded the diagnosis of a large sacral chordoma in January 2009 as an affront, given the numerous relatively trivial complaints about various areas of his body which he had brought to the attention of several medical practitioners over the previous eighteen months, none of which permitted the diagnosis to be made. His desire to cast blame on a member of the medical profession for his imminent demise may be understandable, but was not, in my view, well-founded. It led him to reconstruct the past and to insert entries into his diary which were not contemporaneous and which, at least in part, fitted his preferred hypothesis.
The defendant's credibility
112The defendant was cross-examined to the effect that his clinical notes were deficient. His entries were frequently, if not invariably, laconic. He agreed that he did not, for example, invariably record complaints of pain or other symptoms. Nor did he necessarily record the investigation he had arranged or why he had administered a particular injection. 
113On several occasions, he did not record the results of physical examinations that he had carried out or even the fact that he had carried out a physical examination at all. The defendant said by way of explanation:
""I only record positive findings.""
114He did, however, concede that he was obliged to record negative, as well as positive, findings.
115The defendant agreed that he had formed the view that some of the plaintiff's complaints had a psychiatric or psychological origin and that there was probably a considerable psychogenic component to his complaints. However, he said, and I accept, that such matters would not have deterred him from referring the plaintiff for future investigations if he thought them appropriate. Indeed the evidence showed that each of the four consultations the defendant had with the plaintiff in the relevant period led to the following further investigations:
(1) 18 September 2007: bone scan;
(2) 25 July 2008: CT scan; facet joint injection;
(3) 19 August 2008: nerve conduction studies;
(4) 23 October 2008: referred to Dr Edger for, referral for MRI.
116Although the defendant agreed that he did not always record all the symptoms and complaints made by the plaintiff, he said, and I accept, that he recorded all the complaints that he adjudged to be serious. He said that he adjudged each of the matters he recorded in his clinical note of 18 September 2007 to be serious. He said that if the plaintiff had told him of altered sensation and a feeling of electric shock in his legs he would have regarded that as a significant matter and he would have ordered a different test, namely a CT scan, rather than a bone scan. He also said that a complaint of electric shock in the right leg, buttock and testicles would have been a bizarre complaint that he had not earlier encountered, but that he would have considered it to be serious and would have included it.
117It was apparent from the defendant's evidence that much of which he purported to recall was, in fact, reconstruction from his usual practice and from what was recorded in his clinical notes. This is understandable in the context of a medical practitioner who sees several patients every day. It does not make his evidence unreliable. Indeed, as appears from the passage in Albrighton's Case, his notes are likely to be more reliable than any vestiges of recollection he may have.
118Evidence of usual practice is not only admissible (Connor v Blacktown District Hospital [1971] NSWLR 713 at 721, per Asprey JA, Mason JA agreeing) but I consider it to be probative in the circumstance of the defendant's general practice. I accept that he examined the plaintiff on each of the four consultations.
119I formed the impression that the defendant was telling the truth in his evidence. He readily made concessions about his lack of recollection and the poor quality of some of his notes.
120I accept the defendant's evidence that he examined the plaintiff at each consultation. I accept that the plaintiff complained of the matters recorded in the clinical notes of the consultation kept by the defendant and that the plaintiff did not complain of significant matters that were not recorded: altered sensation and feelings of electric shocks in his legs. I do not accept the plaintiff's submission that these symptoms were ""missed"".
121The plaintiff submitted that he was more likely to have an independent recollection of a particular consultation than the defendant since he was only one of very many of the defendant's patients and the defendant had several consultations per day. Even accepting this to be the case, I do not consider, for the reasons already given, the plaintiff's evidence to be reliable, since I consider it to have been the product of wishful thinking and motive, rather than true recollection.
Conclusion and orders
122For the reasons given above, where the evidence of the plaintiff and the defendant differs, I prefer the evidence of the defendant. I accept the defendant's evidence of the complaints the plaintiff made at the consultation on 18 September 2007. 
123I find that the plaintiff did not complain of altered sensation and feelings of electric shock in his legs at the consultation on 18 September 2007.
124Accordingly, by reason of the agreement between the parties referred to above and my findings as to the consultation on 18 September 2007, I make the following orders:
(1) Judgment for the defendant.
(2) Order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings.

		15 May 2012",2012-05-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759246,RENSHAW v R [2012] NSWCCA 91,"Judgment

1HOEBEN JA:
Offence and sentence
The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed on him on 5 September 2011 by Acting Judge McLauchlan in the District Court at Lismore following his plea of guilty to an offence of aggravated robbery arising out of events that took place at Murwillumbah on 29 April 2010. The aggravating circumstance was the infliction of actual bodily harm.

2The offence of aggravated robbery was contrary to s95(1) Crimes Act 1900 and has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. 

3The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months commencing 5 September 2011 and expiring 4 September 2012 with a balance of term of 10 months to expire on 4 July 2013.

4The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal.

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred by failing to have regard to the mitigating factors, namely the applicant's personal history, his assistance to authorities and the absence of planning in the commission of the offence.

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred by failing to comply with the mandatory conditions of s24(d) Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999. (This ground of appeal was not pursued.)

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred by failing to allow the applicant a discount upon his sentence for the quasi-custody served in rehabilitation.

5When the matter came before the Court on 3 May 2012, error in his Honour's reasons was identified. Accordingly, the following orders were made by the Court with effect from that date.

(1) Leave to appeal is granted.

(2) The appeal is allowed.

(3) The sentence imposed by McLauchlan ADCJ on 5 September 2011 is quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months, commencing 5 March 2011 and expiring 4 March 2012, with a balance of term of 10 months, expiring 4 January 2013.

(4) The applicant is to be released to parole forthwith.

6My reasons for joining in the above orders are as follows.

Factual background

7The applicant had been consuming alcohol on the day of the offence from 4pm. At about 10pm he met with people in a park in Mullumbimby. He consumed alcohol with these people before offering them $20 to take him to Murwillumbah. The group agreed and they drove the applicant to Murwillumbah where they stopped at the Caltex Service Station on the Tweed Valley Way. 

8The victim of the robbery, Mr Briggs, was a 50 year old working a night shift in the service station. The applicant arrived at the service station at about 12.30am. The applicant exited the vehicle and walked towards the shop carrying a $20 note. He entered the console area in which the victim was attending to his duties. He entered through a door that had not been locked.

9The applicant lunged at the victim and placed him in a headlock, at which point a struggle ensued. The applicant stated that he wanted money and forced the victim to open a cash register. The applicant opened another register himself and in total removed a sum that has been stated as between $400 and $700. The applicant then placed the $20 note he had carried into the shop on the counter saying that it was for the fuel.

10When the applicant left the service station, the car with its occupants had left without him. The applicant hitched a ride to his ex-girlfriend's house where he was arrested later that night and released on bail. The applicant agreed to participate in an ERISP in relation to the matter. He made full admissions to the offence upon his arrest. There was no suggestion that the occupants of the vehicle were involved in any way in the offence.

Proceedings before Sentencing Judge

11The matter first came before McLauchlan, an ADCJ, on 8 October 2010. At that time the applicant was already a resident and participant at the Transformations Rehabilitation Centre in accordance with bail conditions set on 22 June 2010. The Transformations Rehabilitation Centre was a fulltime residential rehabilitation centre located in Queensland. His Honour released the applicant upon a recognisance until 1 August 2011, pursuant to s11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (a Griffiths Remand).

12The conditions of the applicant's release were:

(i) To reside at the Transformations Rehabilitation Centre, 2 Iluka Street, Mermaid Beach, Queensland.

(ii) To comply with all directions of the staff employed at the Centre relevant to his residence there and the activities program.

(iii) To complete the program.

(iv) That the Centre must notify the Court registry within 24 hours if the applicant left the rehabilitation centre.

13The applicant, in accordance with those bail conditions, remained in fulltime residence at the rehabilitation centre and completed the rehabilitation course. On 8 August 2011 the applicant appeared before Black DCJ when his bail residential condition and his reporting conditions were changed so that he was required to report to the Tweed Heads Police Station on Tuesdays and Thursdays each week. He was ordered to appear for sentence before McLauchlan ADCJ on 5 September 2011.

14At the sentencing hearing on 5 September 2011 his Honour noted that the cause of the applicant's offending was an alcohol addiction which he had had for some time. His Honour accepted that the applicant was remorseful for his actions.

15His Honour observed, on the material before him:

""The rehabilitation proceeded very successfully indeed. One might say that to date, it has been spectacularly successful and one can perhaps assume that ultimately, if the offender continues to make such progress, it may be completely successful. It certainly is very encouraging for that type of evidence.""

16In relation to the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour took into account that the victim had suffered psychologically from the incident and now had difficulties with his relations with other people. The physical injuries suffered by the victim consisted of some swelling and bruising and scratching to his face that was not in itself severe. His Honour placed the offence at the lower end of the scale for offences of this kind.

17His Honour considered that deterrence in an offence of this kind was an important consideration because it had been committed against a member of the community in a vulnerable occupation. 

18Because the applicant had pleaded guilty at the earliest occasion, his Honour allowed in his favour a discount of 25 percent.

19His Honour seems to have assumed, both on 8 October 2010 and 5 September 2011, that a custodial sentence was the only option open to him. While his Honour did not in terms state that, it is implicit in comments such as ""It is not a matter in respect of which the offender can really hope to escape time in custody ... It is at the lower end of the scale but nevertheless the inherent seriousness of the offence would see a gaol term imposed and would be not less than a minor term"".

20In fixing the sentence, his Honour said:

""I consider that taking into account the matters on both sides, so far as the Crown is concerned the seriousness of the offence, the necessity for deterrence, including in particular the vulnerability of the victim and on the other hand the progress, the very substantial progress towards the offender's rehabilitation which has been made and his entitlement to a discount - I should leave the question of discount for the moment, just the progress which is made towards rehabilitation that an appropriate sentence is a period of 2 ½ years or 30 months' imprisonment.""

21Having applied the discount, his Honour reached the sentence ultimately passed, i.e. 22 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. His Honour found special circumstances in that it was desirable that the applicant should continue with the rehabilitation which had worked so well for him. It was on the basis of those considerations that his Honour justified the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.

Submissions
Ground of Appeal 1

22The applicant submitted that in his sentencing remarks, his Honour made no reference to his personal history, made no findings in relation to the absence of planning and the spontaneous nature of the offence, nor the significance of the applicant's assistance to the police. 

23The submission as to assistance to the police is not made out. It is true that the applicant admitted the offence at the earliest opportunity, but he received the full 25 percent discount for that admission. He was not entitled to any further discount. There was no other conduct which could be characterised as assistance to police.

24His subjective case did, however, require consideration by his Honour. The applicant was born in September 1979 and was 32 at the time of sentencing. He was in a steady relationship, which had lasted five years, and which had produced a child who was aged two and a half years at the time of sentencing. He had a good employment record in the construction industry until he suffered a back injury in 2009 which had prevented him from returning to work.

25The applicant had commenced using alcohol at the age of 17 and by age 22 it had become a problem for him. His problems with alcohol had led to difficulties in his relationship with his partner. These relationship problems had led to a further relapse into alcohol abuse. He had been heavily intoxicated at the time of the offence.

26Although his Honour should have made it clear that he took into account and had considered the applicant's personal circumstances, those circumstances were not such as to require a reduction in sentence. His problems with alcohol explained the commission of the offence but did not excuse or mitigate it. Were this the only error in his Honour's sentencing remarks I would not have considered any reduction in the sentence was warranted.

27While his Honour did not make any specific reference to the lack of planning in the offence, his Honour's review of the facts accurately set out the background to the offence and it is clear that his Honour well understood that there was a lack of planning.

Ground of Appeal 3

28No submissions were made to his Honour, on behalf of the applicant, as to the relevance of ""quasi-custody"" with respect to his time spent in rehabilitation. The applicant's attendance at the rehabilitation centre, gave rise to two issues: Firstly, the positive effect of the rehabilitation and secondly, the time actually spent at the rehabilitation centre. His Honour specifically took into account the first of those issues, but made no mention of the second. I infer that because it was not expressly drawn to his attention and because he failed to make any reference to it, that his Honour did not take that matter into account.

29His Honour's failure to take this matter into account did constitute error. 

30In Regina v Campbell [1999] NSWCCA 76 Kirby J (with whom Grove J agreed) said on a similar issue:

""24 The last complaint was the failure by his Honour to take account of the time spent by the applicant undergoing rehabilitation. It was appropriate that the applicant should have received recognition, and credit for the time spent in rehabilitation. In R v Eastway (CCA, unreported, 19 May 1992), the Court consisting of Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and Mathews J, identified the reasons for doing so. The rehabilitation courses are residential. Persons who undergo them are subject to discipline and restrictions. The Court determined, in that case, that the prisoner should be given credit for half the time spent in rehabilitation. In some cases the proportion has been somewhat higher, as high as 75 percent.

25 Here his Honour did not advert to this aspect, although unquestionably his Honour was aware that the applicant had undergone rehabilitation. It is not apparent from his remarks on sentence that credit was given to the applicant for time spent in rehabilitation. This was an important matter which ought not to have been left to inference. Therefore, I am prepared to find there was error, justifying intervention by this Court, and the setting aside of the sentence. I would therefore give leave to appeal.""

31In R v Delaney [2003] NSWCCA 342 James J (with whom Santow JA agreed, Barr J dissenting) said:

""19 It was submitted before this Court on behalf of the applicant that her Honour had erred in refusing to take into account the periods the applicant had spent in The Salvation Army programs.

20 Counsel for the applicant referred to decisions of this Court in R v Eastway (unreported 19 May 1992) especially at pp 6 to 7 per Hunt CJ at CL; R v Campbell (unreported 12 April 1999) especially per Kirby J at paras 24 and 25; R v Thompson (unreported [2000] 362) especially per James J at [30]

.... 

22 In my opinion, her Honour did err in refusing to take into account the time which the applicant had spent in The Salvation Army programs. The programs both in Sydney and Canberra were residential programs. In his letter of 4 April 2002 Major Harmer referred to the strict discipline expected of clients who enter the William Booth program and in his affidavit of 10 November 2003 Major Harmer reiterated that The Salvation Army program is very strict. The letter from Mr Fairhall listed the activities comprised in the program in which the applicant was participating, including carrying out regular community and housekeeping chores as required. In my opinion, the conditions of the residential programs in which the applicant was participating amounted to conditions of quasi-custody.""

32Similarly, in Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48 Grove J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) said:

""37 Ground 1 is focussed upon the pre-sentence entry by the applicant into rehabilitation programmes. He was in a residential programme conducted by WHOS for twenty days but he transferred to the Salvation Army Bridge Programme in order to avail himself of the one-to-one counselling available there. A letter from Mr Muendel, the Director, indicated his good response to that programme and suggested that it might profitably be completed, however his Honour declined to permit adjournment for that purpose so that the applicant participated in the latter programme from 12 December 2006 until he was committed into custody on 13 February 2007. It would appear then, that the applicant lived within the confines of residential rehabilitation facilities for about 103 days. It is apparent from Mr Muendel's report and his Honour's findings that the applicant made beneficial use of his opportunities.

38 It is appropriate for an offender to receive recognition and credit for time spent in rehabilitation which has been productive: R v Eastaway (unreported, NSWCCA 19 May 1992). An allowance of approximately 50 percent of the credit that would be given in respect of pre-sentence custody has been endorsed: R v Douglas (unreported, NSWCCA 4 March 1997). Pre-sentence custody and the similar concept of rehabilitation ""custody"" is preferably catered for by backdating of the commencement date of sentence: R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588. What is here involved is therefore a potential backdating of a little over fifty days. I would reject the Crown submission that this ground should be rejected because that period is de minimis.""

33Given the nature of the error identified, it is necessary for this Court to consider the facts and to re-sentence if appropriate. In doing so, the Court can take into account the affidavit of Francis Low, sworn 2 May 2012. That affidavit has annexed to it, the conditions which were imposed on the applicant when he attended the Transformations Rehabilitation Centre. It is clear from that annexure that this program was strict, particularly in relation to activities to be performed by participants in accordance with a set timetable and restrictions on freedom generally. The conditions of this residential program clearly amounted to conditions of quasi-custody.

34While I have some reservations about his Honour's implicit acceptance that only a custodial sentence was appropriate (Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 and R v Kyroglou and Tsoukatos [1999] NSWCCA 106), the sentence passed by his Honour was undoubtedly open to him and was reasonable in the circumstances. What ought to be done in accordance with the authorities is for the commencement date of the sentence to be backdated. As already indicated, this was the course adopted by the Court.

35RS HULME J: I agree with Hoeben JA.

36FULLERTON J: I agree with Hoeben JA.

2759248,R v Pratten (No 5) [2012] NSWSC 1668,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: There are nine issues raised as to the provenance of documents sought to be tendered by the Crown. I will deal with the documents separately, notwithstanding that they are in one sense in the same category, and I will deal with them in reverse order.
	
	
	The last page of the document, which is the annexure in Exhibit J on the voir dire, is no longer pressed. The second last document is a document, as are all of the documents, obtained from the web site www.archive.org. The Court, as presently constituted, is familiar with the web site. It is a web site that provides the content of a web site at a particular point in time, as to which evidence on the voir dire attests. The witness refers to the web site as a ""snapshot of web sites over time"".
	
	
	The date on which the snapshot is taken is disclosed in the top right-hand corner of the document produced. My strong view is that the objection is misconceived. The document seems to go to matters that are otherwise agreed.
	
	
	In the case of the document referring to BDO Vanuatu, objection is taken on two bases: firstly, that it is not a business record; and, secondly, the nature of its provenance or the lack of information as to the person who made the representations of fact contained therein.
	
	
	A court is not to assume a document is a business record. Its provenance must be proved or inferred from proper material: NSW Crime Commission v Cassar [2012] 1170, and the cases these cited. It seems to me that a website in the name of BDO Vanuatu, which discloses seemingly complimentary information about BDO Vanuatu, is a document which almost irresistibly arrives from BDO and, given the nature of the manner in which documents are now filed and/or kept, including, for example, cloud computing, the overwhelming inference is this is a document that derives from BDO Vanuatu. On the voir dire the Court has been provided with evidence as to security necessary to alter the content if the site and the possession of that material by BDO. I will admit that document on the basis that it is a business record of BDO Vanuatu as at 2 August 2003.
	
	
	The second document with which I deal is a document being the contents of a website as at 28 August 2007 of PKF Vanuatu. It is similar to the document relating to BDO in that the overwhelming inference is that it is a document of PKF. It is a website of PKF which describes PKF in complimentary terms and the overwhelming inference is that this is a document of PKF. Again, the contents are not in issue. Further, access to the site for alteration of its contents is available only to PKF. I will admit it on that basis.
	
	
	In relation to both PKF and BDO documents to which I have now referred, I will admit the documents as business documents and the contents thereof but not allow their use and, indeed, disallow the use to prove lack of relationship with companies or persons not mentioned in the documents to which I have referred. The latter qualification is made under s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The next document with which I deal is a document also from the archive website, capturing a document from the website of www.cpi.com.vu, that is a Vanuatu address for internet purposes, and said to be dated 26 May 2008. The document describes in very general terms the nature of CPI. For the same reasons I have given in relation to BDO and PKF, I admit that document with the same qualifications and restrictions.
	
	
	Lastly, I turn to the document which is the document of a website www.civilaviationinsurance.com.au, again obtained from the www.archive.org, a website, as is obvious to anyone familiar with the Internet, that this is an Australian Internet address. It seems to have been written by Civil Aviation Insurance which, on the information otherwise available, is part of the business of Rural and General Insurance Broking Pty Ltd, one of the companies which with which Mr Pratten is associated and indeed the document states Mr Pratten is its managing director.
	
	
	The Crown relies upon this document, inter alia, for the purpose of an admission. The document states in the third person that Mr Pratten owned, that is as at 20 November 2008, a helicopter which has been the subject of evidence in these proceedings. The document describes the ownership in the third person. The inference I draw from that is that it was not written by Mr Pratten. The Crown says I should draw the inference that, as managing director, Mr Pratten must have approved the document. That is likely to have been, but not necessarily, what occurred and whether the approval of the document included a close scrutiny of all the statements and documents and comments is a different question.
	
	
	It seems to me that using the document as an admission of ownership in circumstances where, on the face of it, it does not seem to have been written by Mr Pratten, even if it were published by a company with which he is associated, is unfairly prejudicial to Mr Pratten in a way that outweighs its probative value and in the circumstances I reject the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995, that is, the evidence of the second page of the annexure that forms part of Exhibit J on the voir dire.

		29 April 2016",2012-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759254,R v Muldrock; Muldrock v R [2012] NSWCCA 108,"Judgment

1ALLSOP P: Orders were made by this Court on 18 May 2012 resentencing the applicant consistently with the reasons for judgment of the High Court of Australia published on 5 October 2011. These are my reasons for making those orders.

2Mr Derek Muldrock pleaded guilty to a charge of having sexual intercourse with a child under ten years of age contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 66A. The maximum penalty is 25 years imprisonment; there is a standard non-parole period of 15 years.

3The sentencing judge imposed a head sentence of nine years imprisonment but with a non-parole period of only 96 days. This apparently unusual sentence was influenced by the mental retardation of Mr Muldrock and the availability of a place in a facility called ""Selwood Lane"", which is a residential facility that provides rehabilitation of sex offenders.

4Mr Muldrock sought leave to appeal against the head sentence. The Crown appealed against the sentence as manifestly inadequate. The Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the Crown appeal and, in Order 1, quashed the sentence imposed by the District Court. Orders 2 and 3 of this Court's orders were as follows:

""2.Taking into account the matter on the Form 1 the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months commencing on 22 April 2009 and expiring on 21 December 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years and 4 months expiring on 22 April 2018. The respondent will be eligible for release to parole on 21 December 2015.

3. The application by the respondent for leave to appeal is refused.""

5The High Court granted special leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Orders 2 and 3 made by the High Court on 5 October 2011 were as follows:

""2.Set aside paras 2 and 3 of the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales made on 14 May 2010 and in their place order that:

(a)the applicant, Derek Muldrock, have leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Judge Black in the District Court of New South Wales on 28 July 2009; and

(b) the appeal be treated as instituted and heard instanter and allowed.

3.Remit the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal for the appellant to be re-sentenced consistently with the reasons for judgment of this Court.""

6In order to act consistently with the High Court's reasons it is necessary to recount the facts consistent with those described by the High Court. Those facts are for present purposes fully and adequately set out at [1], [33]-[46], [50]-[53], [55] and [58] of the High Court's reasons, as follows:

""[1] The appellant is mentally retarded. As a child he was subject to homosexual sexual abuse. As an adult he has shown a sexual interest in male children. In March 2007, he befriended a nine year old boy and took advantage of an opportunity when the two were alone to suck the boy's penis. ...

...

[33] The appellant was aged thirty years at the date of the offence. The victim was living with his mother in a granny flat attached to the house in which the appellant was living. The appellant fixed the boy's bike and offered to go for a test ride with him. The boy's mother agreed. When the appellant and the boy were alone together, the appellant asked the boy if he wanted to go to the lake to see the animals. They cycled a distance of 1 or 2 km to the lake. They decided to go swimming. The boy had no swimming costume or underwear and he went into the lake naked. The appellant joined him, wearing his underpants or Speedos. He repeatedly tried to touch the boy's penis and bottom, but each time the boy pushed him away. Eventually he succeeded in touching the boy's bottom and the area around his penis. This activity was charged as an offence of aggravated indecent assault. Judge Black took this offence into account in sentencing the appellant for the principal offence.

[34] The boy got out of the water and the appellant pushed him to the ground, pinning him down by kneeling on his legs. He sucked the boy's penis twice for about ten seconds. The boy kicked him in the shoulder or chest and the appellant fell back. The boy got dressed and rode off. The appellant yelled out, 'Come back, you wussy. You're just too scared to come back'. The boy rode to a nearby house. He was in a very distressed state and he told the occupant, Mr Fuzzard, that a man had touched his private parts. Mr Fuzzard drove him home, by which stage the boy was 'sobbing hysterically and shaking'. A short time later, the mother answered a knock at the door and saw the appellant standing there, holding a bike pump. She closed the door on him and contacted the police.

[35] The appellant was interviewed by the police in the presence of a Salvation Army officer, who acted as a support person. He gave an account that he had planned to go swimming by himself and that the boy had invited himself on the excursion. The appellant said that he thought the boy's mother had 'set him up' by allowing the boy to go with him and that the mother would have viewed him as an 'easy target'. He maintained that the boy had falsely accused him of touching him. He denied any wrongdoing. 

[36] The offence occurred on 19 March 2007. The previous offence took place in 2000, when the appellant was living with his parents in Cairns (the 2000 offence). The victim of the 2000 offence was also a neighbouring male child. As earlier noted, the facts of the 2000 offence were similar to those presently under consideration. 

[37] The appellant was referred to Dr Muir, a psychiatrist, for treatment following the commission of the 2000 offence. Dr Muir initially prescribed Androcur, a testosterone suppressant that reduces the sex drive. Androcur is known to have severe complications. Dr Muir ceased prescribing it for the appellant some time before the sentence hearing in the Queensland District Court because he did not consider that its continued use was warranted. He assessed the appellant as having been significantly traumatised by his arrest and court appearances. Dr Muir thought that it was likely that the experience would 'contain' the appellant's behaviour. It is not known what, if any, treatment the appellant received during the twelve months that he was subject to the treatment order. 

[38] The appellant had not previously been sentenced to a term of full-time custody at the time he appeared for sentence before Judge Black. 

The expert evidence 

[39] The respondent tendered the reports of Dr Muir and Ms Daniels, a clinical psychologist, in the proceedings before Judge Black. These reports had been prepared in connection with the proceedings before the Queensland District Court in 2000. Dr Muir concluded that the appellant was 'undoubtedly mentally retarded'. The likely cause of the condition was cerebral anoxia at birth. The appellant had been placed in special classes throughout his school career. He could barely read or write and was only able to tell the time by the use of a digital watch. 

[40] The appellant was sexually abused at the age of ten by a young adult male who performed oral sex on him. Dr Muir said that the appellant's retarded development was the cause of his difficulty in managing his impulses and controlling his actions. 

[41] Ms Daniels assessed the appellant's Performance IQ as within the category of mentally retarded and his Full Scale IQ as within the borderline range. She considered that his 'maladaptive sexual behaviour' appeared to be the manifestation of his own childhood sexual abuse and his mental retardation. In her view, the appellant had little control over his 'acting out behaviour'. 

[42] The appellant was also assessed by Professor Hayes, a psychologist, in connection with the present offence. Professor Hayes reported that the appellant's IQ Composite Standard Score of 62 was indicative of a mild intellectual disability. The appellant functions at a level lower than 99 per cent of the population. His receptive and expressive language is equivalent to that of a child aged five and a half years. Test results measuring the appellant's ability to communicate, daily living skills and level of socialisation (adaptive behaviour) confirmed the diagnosis of mild intellectual disability. The appellant functions in the lowest 0.1 per cent of the population in terms of his adaptive behaviour. 

[43] Professor Hayes observed that:

'Mr Muldrock has deficits in empathy, that is, understanding how another individual is thinking and feeling. Although he has been sexually assaulted himself, he says that he cannot recall how he felt at the time, and he cannot understand how his victim would feel. He also holds a number of cognitive distortions regarding the offences, including the view that ""I'm not purposely like that"".'

[44] Professor Hayes considered that the appellant would benefit from a program designed for a sex offender with an intellectual disability. She commented on the lack of availability of programs for intellectually disabled sex offenders in custody. She suggested that the appellant needed to learn practical skills for dealing with situations in which he is in the proximity of children. She commented on his lack of appropriate social and recreational outlets for a man of his age and ability, suggesting that he required a comprehensive program to address the areas of deficit in his adaptive behaviour. 

[45] Selwood Lane is a six bedroom facility located in a semi-rural setting. There is limited access to the neighbouring premises. Locks are installed on all windows and doors and there is perimeter sensor lighting. Staff are directed to maintain 'line of sight supervision [of residents] at all times'. The staff have experience in working with intellectually handicapped individuals who display 'challenging and highly sexualised behaviours'. 

[46] At the date of the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant was being held in an Additional Support Unit, a facility accommodating offenders who require placement outside the mainstream prison environment. He had been moved to this unit because of his 'challenging behaviour' towards staff and inmates. His poor behaviour had culminated in him being held in segregation for two weeks. It was not known how long he would remain in the Additional Support Unit. 

...

[50] The assessment that the appellant suffers from a 'mild intellectual disability' should not obscure the fact that he is mentally retarded. The condition of mental retardation is classified according to its severity as mild, moderate, severe or profound. Mental retardation is defined by reference to both significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning and significant limitations in adaptive functioning. 'Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning' is defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ or IQ-equivalent) of about 70 or below. The position is well explained in a discussion paper published by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission:

'A person's intellectual disability can be classified as ""mild"", ""moderate"", ""severe"" or ""profound"", based upon certain IQ (intelligence quotient) ranges. A further category, ""borderline"", is also used to indicate people just above the mild range in terms of intellectual functioning. A person with a ""severe"" or ""profound"" disability may be unable to learn basic social skills such as speech, walking and personal care, and is likely to require supported accommodation. The majority of people with an intellectual disability have a ""mild"" level of intellectual disability and ""can learn skills of reading, writing, numeracy, and daily living sufficient to enable them to live independently in the community."" These classifications have limited utility and can sometimes be misleading. For example, such terms may suggest to criminal justice personnel, who do not have a full understanding of the disability involved, that a ""mild"" intellectual disability is inconsequential.' (Footnotes omitted.)

[51] The fact that the appellant had engaged in some paid employment and that he held a driver's licence does not detract from the assessment of his retardation. The evidence was that he had 'enormous difficulty with employment'. He was unemployed at the time Ms Daniels assessed him. She recommended that he would benefit from 'a properly supervised sheltered workshop environment'. He was in receipt of a disability support pension in mid-2008 and had been so for some time when he was assessed by Dr Westmore to determine whether he had sufficient capacity to be fit to be tried. 

[52] Dr Muir's assessment that the appellant understood the wrongfulness of his conduct respecting the earlier offence was qualified by the observation that this was 'only a superficial awareness'. Dr Muir also said:

'In the interview situation, it is readily apparent that Mr Muldrock is significantly mentally retarded. His speech is very slow and measured and in a monotone.'

[53] Judge Black's finding, expressed in lay terms, that the appellant's intellectual disability is 'significant', was apt. It was an error for the Court of Criminal Appeal to reject the finding, if that is what it did. Alternatively, it was an error for the Court to find that Judge Black's determination, that general deterrence had no place in sentencing the appellant, was not justified by the evidence. One purpose of sentencing is to deter others who might be minded to offend as the offender has done. Young CJ, in a passage that has been frequently cited, said this:

'General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.'

In the same case, Lush J explained the reason for the principle in this way:

'[The] significance [of general deterrence] in a particular case will, however, at least usually be related to the kindred concept of retribution or punishment in which is involved an element of instinctive appreciation of the appropriateness of the sentence to the case. A sentence imposed with deterrence in view will not be acceptable if its retributive effect on the offender is felt to be inappropriate to his situation and to the needs of the community.'

...

[55] In this case, there was unchallenged evidence of the causal relation between the appellant's retardation and his offending in the reports of Dr Muir and Ms Daniels. The fact that the appellant possessed the superficial understanding of a mentally retarded adult that it was wrong to engage in sexual contact with a child and that he told childish lies in the hope of shifting the blame from himself were not reasons to assess his criminality as significant, much less to use him as a medium by which to deter others from offending. 

...

[58] The desirability of the appellant undergoing suitable rehabilitative treatment was plainly capable of being a special circumstance justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeal was wrong to hold that Judge Black had been diverted by the evidence concerning Selwood Lane, and that he failed to carry out the task required of a sentencing judge in focusing on rehabilitation and not on denunciation, punishment and deterrence. As explained, punishment, in the sense of retribution, and denunciation did not require significant emphasis in light of the appellant's limited moral culpability for his offence. And there was no requirement for general deterrence. It was open to Judge Black to view personal deterrence as likely to be advanced by a sentence that required the appellant to undergo appropriately tailored treatment in a secure facility such as Selwood Lane. The Court of Criminal Appeal erred in finding that there were no special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act."" (footnotes omitted)

7The reasons of the High Court otherwise dealt with important questions of principle in the approach to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which was introduced into that Act in 2002. The task required of this Court now does not call for any statement of principle. It is necessary to distil the essential operative considerations in the sentencing process relevant to the particular circumstances of Mr Muldrock. In that task it is to be emphasised that it is impossible to replicate what the sentencing judge should or could have done without error. No facility is presently available to assist Mr Muldrock, though, on the evidence, one may be in August of this year. Further, at the time of sentencing (18 May 2012), Mr Muldrock had been in prison for three years and almost four weeks.

8The following considerations can be extracted from the High Court's reasons as relevant to the sentencing task at hand:

(a)Any assessment of the standard non-parole period here was not of primary or determinative concern. Rather the appellant's intellectual disability is the factor which is most relevant to the appellant's moral culpability.

(b)To the extent that s 54A may call for, or makes appropriate, an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, this is to be assessed ""without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending"": see the High Court reasons at [27]. So analysed, here, the offending was below the middle of the range. This is so in particular because of the short duration of the acts and the lack of threat or intimidation. The standard non-parole period said little about the appropriate sentence to be imposed.

(c)The appellant's mental disability was highly relevant to the sentencing process. That disability was significant. It leads to the conclusion that Mr Muldrock had only a superficial understanding of his moral culpability. Thus, to the extent that specific deterrence should play a part in the sentencing process it was a limited factor. The mental disability also meant that he had limited moral culpability for the offence. In this light there was no requirement for general deterrence to play a part in sentencing him and punishment in the sense of retribution and denunciation did not require significant emphasis: see generally the High Court reasons at [58].

9An important consideration to take into account in the decision is the question of the protection of the public, a matter specifically referred to in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 3A(c). This was not the first offence of the applicant. He had previously been convicted in Queensland seven years before of a similar offence committed in similar circumstances. The Queensland District Court sentenced him to twelve months imprisonment to be served by way of an intensive correctional order.

10As to special circumstances, they are plainly present in my view. The intellectual disability of the applicant and his need for supervision and specific programmes of care mean that the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term should be different from that set out in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 44.

11It is to be recognised that the Court is not sentencing the applicant otherwise than he having now spent somewhat over three years in prison. Rehabilitation can be seen as important. It is plain, and it was a matter to which the original sentencing judge directed considerable attention, that the applicant would benefit from specific courses for sex offenders with his degree of disability. That said, however, we are required to sentence him in circumstances where the evidence reveals that the Community Justice Programme has only an intensive residential support service placement available for the applicant from late August 2012. For Mr Muldrock to take advantage of this while on parole, his head sentence would need to extend past August 2012 for some months for a meaningful programme. On any view, such a sentence would be excessive.

12Looking at all the circumstances and taking into account all the reasons of the High Court of Australia, I am not able to come to the view that the appropriate sentence for the applicant should be any more than a term of imprisonment of twelve months non-parole period with a balance of term of two years. That would have him released immediately. That would mean that there would not be available to him through the Community Justice Programme a future programme that may help him. He has, however, been in prison for three years and the State has had the opportunity of giving to the applicant the benefit of some programme. That is not said by way of criticism if that has not occurred up to this time. It is no part of the function of this Court to make such criticism; nor, however, is it part of the function of this Court to reach a sentence longer than is appropriate to reflect the purpose of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in order that social services may be made available at a later date.

13For a sentence, now, to be fashioned to extend to a four year head sentence in order that Mr Muldrock have the possibility of participating in the course that can start in August would be unjust. He may well languish in prison until August, the head sentence being of a length that denies the Court the power to order him to be released on parole.

14The matter is an extraordinary one. The public has been protected for over three years. Further imprisonment of a man who is mentally retarded with a limited recognition of moral culpability would be wrong. It would serve no purpose of deterrence. It would be longer than would be a just and appropriate sentence.

15These are my reasons for joining in the order made on 18 May 2012.

16HOEBEN JA: I agree with Allsop P. His reasons reflect in substance my reasons for joining in the orders of the Court on 18 May 2012.

17BEECH-JONES J: Subject to the following observations, I agree with the reasons for judgment of Allsop P.

18From the time of the sentencing hearing before Black DCJ to the rehearing in this Court it appears to have been accepted at every level that some form of period of supervision of Mr Muldrock after his release from custody was desirable, and in fact necessary, to facilitate his rehabilitation. In pronouncing orders on 18 May 2012 Allsop P restated the desirability of that occurring. His Honour did so with the agreement and on behalf of all members of the Court. Yet the orders of this Court, with which I agree and which are most likely to represent the completion of the sentencing process, will not require that any such supervision occur. This result is surprising to say the least but it is an outcome that was mandated by four matters which I will outline.

19First, there are the findings of fact that are binding on this Court which result from Black DCJ's sentencing judgment and the High Court's judgment. They are outlined in the passages from the High Court's judgment extracted in the reasons of Allsop P and include that Mr Muldrock is ""significantly intellectual disabled"" (Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [48] to [49] as explained at [42] to [43]) and that he had little or no control over his actions due to his mental retardation (Muldrock at [40] to [41]). The High Court concluded that he had ""limited moral culpability for his offence"" (Muldrock at [58])

20Second, there are the findings of the High Court as to the manner in which the various factors relevant to the sentencing process are to be applied and its characterisation of Mr Muldrock's offence. Thus this Court must act on the basis that punishment and denunciation do not require ""significant emphasis"" and, most importantly, there is ""no requirement for general deterrence"" (Muldrock at [58]). The High Court did not characterise the circumstances of Mr Muldrock's offence as falling within the ""middle of the range of objective seriousness"" so as to attract any consideration of the standard non parole period (Muldrock at [32]) and otherwise described it in terms that did not suggest it could be characterised as an especially serious contravention of s 66A of the Crimes Act ("" the circumstances of the offence, the nature of the intercourse, its short duration and the absence of accompanying threats or other intimidating behaviour"" : Muldrock at [60]). 

21Third, there are two conclusions of the High Court specific to Mr Muldrock which must be noted, namely that this Court was previously in error in overturning Black DCJ's finding of special circumstances (Muldrock at [58]) and that an overall term of nine years imprisonment was manifestly excessive (Muldrock at [60]).

22Fourth, there is the circumstance that, notwithstanding the terms of the sentence imposed by Black DCJ, Mr Muldrock remained in custody after he was sentenced and has been in custody ever since. By the time the matter was heard in this Court Mr Muldrock had been in custody for a period in excess of three years, including a period exceeding 7 months from the time the High Court published its judgment and orders to the date the matter was heard in this Court. 

23The removal of general deterrence and the greatly diminished role of denunciation and punishment left only a limited range of sentencing considerations in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be applied to Mr Muldrock. When those remaining considerations are applied to an offender in his circumstances and to an offence that is characterised in accordance with the High Court's judgment then an overall sentence of three years was appropriate. A finding of special circumstances was required even if, as a practical matter, the time for Mr Muldrock to be released and supervised has already passed. 

24Subsection 3A(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act specifies that one of the purposes of sentencing is to protect the community from the offender and s 3A(d) identifies the related object of promoting their rehabilitation. However, if this Court increased Mr Muldrock's sentence beyond 3 years for the purposes of enabling him to be supervised it would have acted contrary to the principle restated by the High Court in Muldrock at [60] that ""a fundamental precept of the criminal law is that a sentence should not be increased beyond that which is proportionate to the crime in order to extend the period of protection of the community"" (citing Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 472 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ). During the course of argument the possibility was raised of not backdating Mr Muldrock's sentence to the date he went into custody but fixing it to commence from a later date so that there would now be an unexpired portion of his sentence that would allow him be subject to supervision. To exercise the power conferred by s 47(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in that manner would be objectionable for the same reason.

25The combination of the findings and circumstances that has resulted in the sentence imposed by Mr Muldrock are likely to be unique. The sentence imposed in this case is unlikely to offer much guidance to the appropriate sentence in other cases. In considering other cases, the High Court's judgment in Muldrock meant that standard non-parole periods had a reduced significance to what was previously considered by this Court to be the case. However they are not without significance. The High Court observed in Muldrock at [31] (omitting citations):

""It may be, as the Court of Criminal Appeal observed in Way, that for some Div 1A offences there will be a move upwards in the length of the non-parole period as a result of the introduction of the standard non-parole period. This is the likely outcome of adding the court's awareness of the standard non-parole period to the various considerations bearing on the determination of the appropriate sentence.""

2759258,RGM v R [2012] NSWCCA 89,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2JOHNSON J:  I agree with Fullerton J.
3FULLERTON J:  On 4 June 2010 the appellant was convicted after trial of two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.  The circumstance of aggravation was by reason of the complainant's age.  She was 14 at the time of the offence charged in the first count and 14 or 15 at the time of the offence charged in the second count.  He appeals his conviction on both counts.  
4On 29 June 2010 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for an effective term of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.  There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
The application for leave to appeal out of time 
5A notice of intention to appeal was filed personally by the appellant on 30 June 2010.  That notice expired on 31 December 2010.  An application for leave to appeal was filed on 26 September 2011 together with an application for an extension of time within which to bring the appeal.  The Crown opposed leave being granted and relied upon its written submissions.  The appellant did not file any written submissions in reply to the Crown's opposition to leave being granted.
6The appellant relied upon an affidavit of Sophie Evans, a solicitor employed by the firm of solicitors to whom the matter was assigned by the Legal Aid Commission in October 2010, a time when the notice of intention to appeal was still current.  Ms Evans took immediate steps to notify this Court of her receipt of instructions.  
7On 17 December 2010 she was supplied with the available transcript from the Reporting Sevices Branch together with their advice that there was no transcript available for the proceedings on 8 June 2010.  She immediately thereafter briefed counsel with the transcript which was available.  She then sought to obtain a copy of the transcript of the proceedings of 8 June 2010 in order to brief counsel with the complete transcript.  The transcript was not made available until 22 August 2011.  She also deposed to the fact that a copy of a jury note was missing from the trial papers as a further explanation for the delay in prosecuting the appeal.  The jury note was made available on 13 September 2011. 
8The Crown relied upon R v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 at 148 as authority for the proposition that where there is any considerable delay in prosecuting an appeal exceptional circumstances will be required before the appeal is permitted to proceed.  The Crown also emphasised the clear public interest in the avoidance of delay in bringing appeals to this Court and the powerful policy considerations underpinning the finality of judicial decisions (see Darwiche v R; El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [38]).  
9The Crown did not submit that the proposed grounds of appeal were so lacking in merit that leave should be refused for that reason.  It relied upon what was said to be an inadequate explanation for the delay of 15 months from the date of sentence to filing of the application, in that it should have been apparent from the transcript of proceedings on 4 June and 25 June 2010, which was available to be briefed to counsel, that nothing of any significance would have occurred on 8 June (two days after verdict).  The Crown also relied upon the fact that Ms Evans does not say when she realised the jury note was missing and what efforts were made to obtain a copy of it.  
10Although there is no evidence of any contact between Ms Evans and counsel as to to the potential significance of the missing day's transcript or the missing jury note there is nothing to suggest that Ms Evans was other than genuinely concerned to ensure that counsel was briefed with all appropriate materials.  The jury note was ultimately relied upon in the filed submissions in support of Ground 3(b) of the appeal. 
11I am not persuaded that the delay of 15 months is inordinate, necessitating a finding of exceptional circumstances before leave will be granted or that the explanation for the delay is inadequate.  Where the Crown does not submit that the appeal is without merit, I am satisfied that the interests of justice require that leave should be granted to extend the time for bringing the appeal.  In coming to that view I have given consideration to the legitimate expectations of witnesses, victims and the family of victims that criminal proceedings are at an end where the time limit for bringing an appeal set by the Parliament has expired and, in this case, that a successful appeal against conviction may result in witnesses giving evidence a third time after an earlier trial did not proceed to verdict.  In that regard I note that the complainant's evidence was received in the subject trial by the tender of an electronic record of her evidence at the first trial.
The appeal in summary 
12The appellant was the complainant's stepfather.  He commenced a relationship with the complainant's mother when the complainant was 3 years of age and moved into the family home when she was 6.  The appellant and the complainant's mother subsequently had two children who were aged 8 and 9 at the time of the offences.   
13The charges relate to two discrete incidents that occurred in the family home in February 2007 when the complainant was 14 and then again either just before or just after her 15th birthday in October 2007.  She was 17 years of age when she gave evidence.  
14The incident the subject of the first count occurred in her parents' bedroom after the appellant got into bed with the complainant when she was watching television.  The incident the subject of the second count occurred in the lounge room after she had fallen asleep while watching television and after her younger siblings had gone to bed.  On both occasions the complainant believed her mother was somewhere in the house although she did not know where.  There were no witnesses to either incident. 
15The way the trial judge suggested the jury should assess the complainant's evidence is the subject of the second ground of appeal.  In summary, the appellant submitted that his Honour provided the jury with a discursive commentary on children, and the evidence of children, which exceeded the legitimate bounds of judicial comment and was liable to be understood by the jury as requiring them to view the complainant's evidence in a particular way, deflecting them from making their own assessment of her credibility and reliability.
16The Crown also adduced evidence of other misconduct by the appellant, including two discrete occasions where he touched the complainant's genitals and breasts (one incident in 2006 before the sexual assault charged as Count 1 and a second occasion in 2008 after the sexual assault charged as Count 2); multiple occasions when he touched her on the breasts and the backside as she passed him in the hallway of the home and repeated instances when he would enter the bathroom whilst she was showering (on some occasions undressing and entering the shower cubicle with her) and then follow her into her bedroom whilst she was dressing.  The Crown also adduced evidence from the complainant that the appellant commented upon her clothing, accessed her telephone to check on her contact with boys, was violent towards her and her brother and threatened to inflict violence on her and her mother.  The trial judge's directions as to how the jury were permitted to use this evidence was the subject of the second ground of appeal.  
17The appellant gave evidence denying any sexual interest in the complainant.  He also denied inflicting violence or threatening violence or indecently touching the complainant or having sexual intercourse with her.  He gave evidence that his relationship with the complainant was stable until mid way through 2008 when heated exchanges erupted over the time she would take to shower in the mornings when he needed access to the bathroom before work, and her use of the bathroom in the afternoons when he wanted to shower after exercise.  He gave evidence that he was so frustrated by her defiance that on occasions he used a knife to open the bathroom door and would demand that she finish showering, and that on occasions he would take off his clothes and go into the bathroom to force her out.  He claimed that the complainant acted in defiance of his efforts to discipline her in other respects, in particular by limiting her use of the mobile phone.  The first ground of appeal complains that the trial judge did not remind the jury of the appellant's evidence concerning these issues and that a summary of defence counsel's submissions was not sufficient to enable the jury to appreciate the defence case.   
18The appellant acknowledges that Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to each of the grounds of appeal.  As this Court has said on repeated occasions the Rules do not operate as a mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside at the hearing of the appeal.  In Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; 70 NSWLR 467 at [11]-[12] the Court said:[11]  In R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191 this court held: ""...it is the duty of counsel appearing at the trial to take objection to matters which, in their view, are irregular, or which might be unduly prejudicial to their client, and in particular to raise, in relation to the summing up, any matters which the trial judge may have overlooked or which, in their view, he has put erroneously.""
[12] A failure by counsel to perform this duty may be explicable because: (a) he overlooked the point or was unaware of the law on the subject;(b) he deliberately said nothing hoping to gain a tactical advantage at a later stage; or(c) he took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, he saw no injustice or error in what was done - Tripodina (at 193 and 191).
19In addition, an appellant for leave is obliged under Rule 4 to establish that the particular ground of appeal under consideration is arguable and that a miscarriage of justice has resulted from either the trial judge's misdirection or the failure to direct the jury in accordance with law, in the sense that a real chance fairly open of acquittal has been lost (see R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 at [20]-[24]).  In this case no explanation was proffered to explain counsel's failure to seek redirections, or in the case of Grounds 2 and 3(a), to invite the trial judge to withdraw some aspects of his summing up.  The Court was informed it was the last case counsel appeared in but took the matter no further.  The absence of any explanation usually counts against leave being granted under Rule 4 (see Wong v R [2009] NSWCCA 101 at [145]).
The evidence of complaint 
20Complaint was first made in November 2008 to a school friend and then to a teacher.  The complainant agreed in cross-examination that she was selective at that time about what she revealed of the sexual assaults because she did not want the police to be involved.  In particular, she agreed that she did disclose to the teacher that she had been ""raped"", by which she meant full penile/vaginal penetration.  The complaint to the teacher was of being sexually assaulted ""... about five times over the last two years [but] it hasn't happened in a while"", and that while the assaults ""sometimes happened on the lounge room, most of the time it happened in [her] bedroom"".  
21She was first interviewed by police on 17 November 2008 after the allegations were reported to them in accordance with the teacher's disclosure obligations.  The audiotape of that interview was accidentally wiped necessitating that she be re-interviewed some weeks later.  The content of the first interview was given in evidence by the interviewing officer, inclusive of the complaint that the appellant had ""raped her"".  The police officer also gave evidence that the complainant variously said she did not remember it; it was a long while ago; that it happened at her home but she did not know where; that it happened ""a year and a bit ago"" and it only happened once.  She also told police that she had been ""molested"" and that the last incident had occurred in her parents' bedroom some months earlier.  The police officer gave evidence that the complainant expressed fears about the impact of her disclosures on her mother and other members of her family, and that she said ""I don't want mum and [the appellant] to know I told you.  I don't want the family to break up"".  She also told police she had never been hit or chastised by the appellant.
22In the course of a further police interview on 2 December 2008 the complainant was uncertain as to the dates upon which the incidents occurred or anything by which they might be referenced.  On that occasion she said that the appellant touched her on the ""boobs or the bum"" as he walked past in the hallway and that he would come into the bathroom whilst she was showering.  She again expressed uncertainty as to when the penetrative sexual assaults had occurred and where in the house they were perpetrated.
23In a telephone conversation with investigating police on 15 December 2008 she provided details of the time frames within which various incidents occurred by which Counts 1 and 2 were then framed.  On 16 December 2008 proceedings were commenced against the appellant by way of the service of a court attendance notice. 
24On 6 July 2009 and 26 October 2010 the complainant gave further statements in which further details of the assaults and other acts of misconduct were provided.  
25The investigating police officer agreed with defence counsel that the complainant's account emerged over a lengthy period of time.
The complainant's evidence of the offences on the indictment
Count 1 
26The complainant said on an occasion in February 2007 she was in her parents' bedroom watching a DVD on the television while lying on her mother's side of the double bed.  Although she had informed police in December 2008 that the appellant had had sex with her ""about a year and a half ago"" in December 2008 (which would have dated the incident in the middle of 2007) by the time she gave her evidence she was able to appoint February as the month in which the assault occurred by reference to having played competitive sport in Wollongong where she stayed at a local hotel with her mother and sister.  This was proved to be in February 2007 by other evidence. 
27She said that it was not unusual for her to watch a DVD in her parents' room while other family members watched cable television in the lounge room.  She said the appellant came into the bedroom, got undressed and got into bed on his side.  She said she was unable to recall what she was wearing but later in her evidence she said that she had been wearing long pants and underwear which she put back on when she got out of bed (the inference being that the appellant had removed them although she gave no evidence of that occurring).  She said she was lying on her back when the appellant rolled on top of her put one arm underneath her, pushed her legs open and put his penis into her vagina.  She said he moved it for about two minutes which caused her pain.  She said his forearm was across her chest.  She said she did not make any noise but tried to struggle free of his grip which she ultimately succeeded in doing enabling her to get out of the bed.  She said she thought the bedroom door was closed.  She went from her parents' bedroom to her bedroom.  She said she did not see her mother and did not know where she was at that time.
28She said in cross-examination that she did not complain to her mother about the assault because she was afraid her mother would not believe her or that her mother would confront the appellant and he would hurt them.  When it was put to her that she informed police in her first statement that the appellant had never hit or chastised her she said that he had in fact threatened her and had thrown things at her but agreed she did not tell police about that.
Count 2 
29The complainant appointed the time of the second incident by reference to having transferred high schools halfway through 2007 and that the incident occurred in either the middle of third term or the commencement of the fourth term at the new school.  She said that on this occasion the entire family were watching cable television in the lounge room and that she had fallen asleep.  She said that when she woke up the television was still on, she was lying on her back, the appellant was sitting next to her on her right side touching her vagina, including with his hands ""inside her vagina"".  She said she was probably wearing boxer shorts and a singlet.  She said this continued for less than a minute after she had woken up.  She said she told the appellant to stop and that she managed to struggle free after which she went to her bedroom.  
30She was asked whether there were other occasions when she was touched by the appellant in a similar way.  She said there were but she was unable to recount them because they were so numerous.
The complainant's evidence of other acts of misconduct
31The complainant gave evidence that her relationship with the appellant changed when she was about 13 or 14 when he began to touch her on the breasts and on the backside.  She said this happened three to four times a week.  She said while he was walking past her in the hallway he would ""grope"" her or ""smack on the bum for no reason"".  In his opening address the Crown told the jury that this evidence was relied upon by the Crown to enable the jury to understand the charges on the indictment in the sense that they were committed ""in the context of inappropriate touching"". 
32The complainant also said that although she was unable to recall the first time that the appellant touched her on the breast she did recall a particular incident where (while touching her) he found what he believed was a cyst on her breast which he reported to her mother with the suggestion that she be taken to a doctor.  A doctor's visit was subsequently arranged.  The lump was benign.
33The complainant said the first occasion that the appellant touched her vagina was just after her 14th birthday in October 2006.  She said this occurred in her bedroom.  She said her younger brother and sister were watching a television quiz show and had fallen asleep.  She said she was on her bed as was the appellant.  She said she was falling asleep and rolled over on her side to face the wall and as she was dozing off to sleep she felt the appellant touching her breasts and her vagina with his hands.  She said he started by touching on the outside of her clothing and then he moved his hand inside her underwear.  She said this lasted about five to ten minutes and it stopped when she pretended to wake up.  She said that the next morning, the appellant apologised and that she queried what he was apologising for because she wanted to pretend that she was unaware that he had assaulted her.  
34By reference to a sketch plan drawn in the witness box she nominated the bathroom in which she customarily showered both before she went to school and before she went to bed.  She said the bathroom had a pushbutton locking mechanism which could be opened from the outside by inserting a knife.  She said the appellant either opened the bathroom door or unlocked it by means of a knife and then came into the bedroom every time she took a shower.  Later in her evidence she said this happened on average three to four times a week.  She said she would turn and face the wall inside the shower to cover her nakedness.  She said when she asked the appellant why he had come into the bathroom he would ""make up an excuse every time ... [such as] I need to get my toothbrush"".  She said on occasions he would get into the shower with her, effectively blocking her from getting out and causing her to move around the wall of the shower to get out after which she would grab a towel around herself and go to her bedroom.  She said the appellant would invariably then follow her into her bedroom making up another excuse for being there.  She said when she challenged him by asking what he wanted he would simply stand there and ""ask a stupid question"".  She did not give any evidence of being assaulted either in the shower or in her bedroom on these occasions.  In opening the Crown also told the jury that this conduct was ""part of the background of what was happening in the household to put the charged acts into context"".  
35The complainant also gave evidence of an occasion a few months before she first made complaint in November 2008 of going into her parents' bedroom to give the appellant a hug and to say goodnight when he took the opportunity of putting his hands down her boxer shorts and touching her on the outside of her vagina.  She said she told him to stop it but that he continued after which she struggled free and ran out of the bedroom and into her bedroom. 
36Other evidence was led of the appellant making comments upon the complainant's clothing being too revealing, repeated enquiry as to where she was going and who she was going out with and constant attempts to regulate her use of her mobile telephone.  
Cross-examination of the complainant
37Defence counsel put to the complainant that she had originally lied to her friend about being sexually assaulted by the appellant to attract attention to herself without appreciating that she would inform her teacher, and that the authorities would necessarily become involved and that she then became committed to the lie and was unable to extricate herself from it.  It was put to her that her developing account to police about the appellant's mistreatment (including the fact that the incident in the lounge room in October 2006 was not reported until October 2009) was because she had lied from the outset and that she was making up the story to improve on the initial lie, knowing that the case was to be prosecuted in a court.  She rejected that suggestion.  She said her memory had improved with the help of counsellors, her family and her boyfriend.
38Counsel cross-examined her the following way: Q:  You relate a number of incidents about which you've given evidence in this court.  With the exception of the first incident, none of them occurred in your bedroom.  Is that right?A:  Some things happened in the bedroom, yes.
Q:  It wouldn't be that by October of 2009 you felt the need to have something happening in your bedroom, because that's what you'd said to [your teacher] initially, would it?A:  I don't remember.
Q:  It wouldn't be that's the reason why your memory improved so dramatically to be able to highly specifically describe something that happened in your bedroom, would it?A:  I remembered over time that first incident because now it is so clear in my mind but other incidents that happened in the bedroom because all this happened over such a long time and it happened so often I can't remember every single detail of every single time that he's come into my room and done things.
Q:  In relation to the incident you've described as penile vaginal intercourse, as when [RGM] you say raped you, that too is something which emerged over time, your narrative about it emerged over time, got more comprehensive as time went on?A:  I remembered [it] over time.
39Defence counsel cross-examined the complainant about her failure to report any incidents of sexual misconduct, in particular the conduct comprehended by the first count on the indictment which, according to the complainant, occurred in her parents' bedroom whilst her mother was close by in the house.  It was also put to her that claiming that she was fearful of being hurt by the appellant were she to complain to her mother because the appellant had ""threatened [her] thousand times and threw things at [her]....[and] that he had threatened her many many, many times"", was also something that she had made up as her narrative developed and that it was inconsistent with what she told police when they spoke with her in 2008.  
40She agreed that one of the reasons for the friction developing between her and the appellant was her use of the shower in the main bathroom and her use of the mobile telephone.  She agreed that the arguments about it were well known to her mother but disagreed that the appellant only ever entered the bathroom to hurry her along.  She rejected the proposition that he did not get into the shower with her.  
41In so far as the mobile telephone was concerned, she gave the following evidence in cross-examination:   Q:  Once again there was no secret about this, there were arguments between you and he about the topic of mobile phones?A:  Yes.
Q:  Throughout 2008?A:  Yes.
Q:  More particularly from about July 2008?A:  Pardon?
Q:  More particularly from about June or July of 2008?A:  I don't know.
Q:  The arguments got more constant?A:  I don't know.
Q:  You see what he was doing was attempting to police your use of the mobile phone?A:  Okay.
Q:  That's something you took exception to?A:  What's exception mean?
Q:  You disagreed with it?A:  Yes well it's my phone, I bought it.
Q:  Exactly, and you weren't going to take it?A:  Well he's not --
Q:  [The appellant] attempting to police your use of the mobile phone, you weren't going to wear it?A:  No.
Q:  You had argued with him about it just as you would argue with him about being in the shower?A:  He was arguing with me, he started it, yeah.
Q:  You'd stand up and have toe to toe arguments with him about it?A:  What do normal teenagers do?
Q:  You say --A:  We don't bow.
Evidence from the complainant's mother 
42The complainant's mother gave evidence that there were occasions when the appellant watched television in their bedroom with the appellant but without her.  In so far as the incident concerning the suspected lumps on the complainant's breasts, she confirmed that there was an occasion when the complainant was about 12 years of age when the appellant lifted up her shirt and pointed out some lumps, or suspected lumps on her breast.  Nothing was said at that time by either the appellant or the complainant about how the lump was detected and she did not inquire.  She agreed that the complainant was taken to the doctor at the appellant's urging and that the lumps proved to be benign.
43The Crown also led evidence from the complainant's mother that there were frequent and heated arguments between herself and the appellant and occasions when he would sleep elsewhere in the house - sometimes in the complainant's bedroom.  She gave evidence of one occasion on Halloween in 2008 when, without her knowledge, the appellant had slept in the complainant's room.  She said when she saw him emerging from the complainant's bedroom:... he came out and looked - he had his head down and I said to him ""what's wrong, what's happened"" and he just looked down and didn't answer me. 
44The Crown also led evidence from her that the appellant would lose his temper with the children.  She gave evidence of a particular incident when the appellant used a skipping rope to hit his son on the leg.  She claimed that this was an unprovoked act of violence on the part of the appellant and that on another occasion the appellant had hurt his hand chastising his son.  She also gave evidence that the appellant threatened to kill her and the complainant if there was a custody dispute involving the younger children.  
45In so far as the shower incidents were concerned the complainant's mother confirmed in cross-examination that the complainant showered twice a day and that it was frequently the case that she would leave for school at the time the appellant would leave for work.  She also confirmed that there were occasions when the complainant was in the shower when the appellant would unlock the bathroom door with a knife and walk in, and that on occasions he would take his clothes off outside the bathroom door and enter the bathroom naked.  She said this happened several times,  which prompted her to tell her daughter to get out of the shower to allow the appellant to use it.  She agreed in cross-examination that she attributed this to the appellant's impatience in wanting to use the bathroom.  She agreed that on occasions the appellant would get the complainant's brother to slip open the locked door to get her out of the shower.  She said that this occurred quite openly and that her daughter would then get out of the shower.  She agreed that there were occasions when the appellant went into the complainant's bedroom after she left the bathroom.  She said she did not know why and her daughter did not complain to her that anything untoward had occurred. 
46The Crown also led evidence from the complainant's mother that while she did not have any concern about her daughter's use of her mobile phone the appellant did not approve of her receiving text messages from boys and that there were continual arguments between her daughter and the appellant about the mobile phone.  She said the appellant discussed this with her and he imposed a rule (that was not strictly enforced) that the mobile phone remain in the kitchen overnight.  She also said that the appellant would make repeated and continual complaints about the clothes the complainant was wearing and that she was seen talking to boys.  
The appellant's evidence 
47The appellant denied sexually assaulting the complainant or misconducting himself sexually toward her in any way.  He said that there was an occasion when the complainant said that she had a sore breast which she pointed out to him and that he felt a lump on the outside of her school uniform.  He said he raised it with the complainant's mother but did not lift up her shirt.  
48He said his relationship with the complainant was stable until midway through 2008 when, as he described it, ""we started to have the heated battles"" in particular over the shower and the mobile phone.  He gave evidence that he was concerned about her behaviour and that he took her mobile phone to seek advice from a doctor about the content of her text messaging.  He said that these arguments erupted every couple of days or so.  He also accepted that the complainant resisted the steps he took to monitor her use of her mobile telephone in response to text messages which he considered inappropriate and that whilst he raised the matter with his wife she did not intervene.
49He agreed that he used a knife to unlock the door to the shower, as did his son following his example.  He said he only went into the bathroom after unlocking the door on two or three occasions to move the complainant along and on each occasion he waited until she left the bathroom before he entered. 
50The Crown also put to the appellant that he regarded the complainant's behaviour as deliberately defying his need to use the shower and it made him so angry that he was prepared to get into the shower with her to force her out.  He denied that this was the case.  The Crown cross-examined the appellant the following way:Q:  And it made you angry.  You had to yell for 20 or 30 minutes.  She wasn't coming out.  It made you angry?A:  Yeah.
Q:  To the extent where you'd get a knife or some implement, slip the lock and go into the shower, into the bathroom I should say?A:  That was on two or three occasions.
Q:  Only two or three occasions?A:  Correct.
Q:  And she would be naked, still in the shower?A:  I gather so, yeah.
Q:  Well you went in --A:  It was fogged up.
Q:  Surely you saw what she was doing?A:  Well I raised the girl since she was three.  I didn't raise her since she was 16.
Q:  I understand that sir but the question simply is was she naked in the shower when you went in?A:  I'd say she would've been, yeah.
Q:  Well why do you say ""I say she would have been"".  You're in the bathroom with her.  You would see her, surely.  Did you see her when you went into the bathroom?A:  I would've seen her yeah but.
HIS HONOUR
Q:  And if she was in the shower she wouldn't have had any clothes on one assumes?A:  Yeah.
Q:  And she was no longer three?A:  Yes.
TRIAL ADVOCATE
Q:  She was 16?A:  Yes.
Q:  She was fully developed by then wasn't she in a physical sense?A.  Yes.
Q:  Why didn't you pick up your shaving gear then and simply go to the other bathroom to shave?A:  At the time it was, that was the, there was just set rules.  The other one was the tiny little bath tub, tiny little shower and that was just set out to be mine and [my wife's] bathroom, the big bathroom.
Q:  You weren't very flexible in how you approached that particular issue were you?A:  Well I think she wasn't.
51The cross-examination continued for some pages before the following questions were put:Q:  When did [the complainant] reach puberty?A:  I could not tell you.
Q:  In 2008 she had fully developed breasts?A:  I'd say so, I don't know what the developed nature ... (not transcribable)
Q:  All right, from the age of her turning, say 14, did you ever walk into her bedroom and discover her naked?A:  Not that I recall.
Q:  Would you agree with the proposition that most fathers would be cautious about going into their daughter's bedroom if she were undressed and they knew that.  Would you agree with that?A:  Yes.
Q:  Would you agree with the proposition that most fathers would not be prepared to get into a shower with their daughter if she was 14 or 15 or 16 years of age?A:  (No verbal reply)
Q:  Would you agree with that?A:  Yes.
Q:  It would not be appropriate behaviour would you agree?A:  I think not.
Q:  Whether or not there was any sexual interest it would be beyond the normal boundaries.  Would you agree with that?A:  Yes.
Q:  I put it to you that you did get into the shower with [the complainant] when she was 14, 15 or 16 years of age and when she was naked.  Do you deny that?A:  Did not happen.
Q:  I put it to you that you are saying it did not happen because you understand it was improper.  Do you agree with that?A:  No.
52The appellant denied ever sleeping in the complainant's bedroom or indeed sleeping in any other room of the house irrespective of the arguments with his wife.  When asked to comment upon his wife's evidence concerning his behaviour upon leaving the complainant's bedroom around Halloween 2008 he said that was more than likely because he was carrying one of the younger children into their bedroom.  He agreed that he criticised the complainant for wearing clothing which he regarded as too revealing. 
53The appellant denied making any threats of violence, whether towards the complainant or her mother.  In particular, he denied threatening to harm his wife or kill her if she prevented him from seeing the children in the event that there was a marital separation.  He agreed that he hit his son with a skipping rope but said this was to punish him for swearing at his mother.  He denied there was any occasion when he hurt his hand chastising his son.  
54The Crown cross-examined the appellant at length about the incident involving the lumps on the complainant's chest.  He also cross-examined him, again at some length, about hitting his son with the skipping rope, returning to the issue more than once apparently to seek to expose the appellant as a person with an uncontrolled temper.  The appellant insisted it was to punish his son and that it was justified.
Ground 3(a):  The trial judge erred in the directions concerning the use that could be made of the relationship or context evidence
55I propose to deal with this ground of appeal first since I am satisfied that the potential for this evidence to have been misused by the jury, and the failure of the trial judge to protect against it, necessitates that the appeal be upheld and a new trial ordered.   
56As is obvious from the summary of the complainant's evidence and the evidence of her mother, in addition to the specific evidence in proof of the offences the subject of indictment, a great deal of evidence reflecting adversely on the appellant was adduced by the Crown, none of which was the subject of objection.  This evidence might be grouped loosely into three categories; other acts of overt sexual misconduct involving the complainant; other generalised misconduct also involving the complainant; and unacceptable behaviour in the appellant's dealings with the complainant, the complainant's mother and his own son.  
The use to which the Crown prosecutor put the context evidence
57Evidence in the first category (that is, other sexual misconduct) was relied upon by the Crown in his closing address for three express purposes.  The first so that the jury could ""understand that [the complainant's] evidence fully"" (from which I understand him to mean that the evidence was relied upon to explain the context in which the subject offences occurred in some relevant respect as required by Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; 171 A Crim R 463 and DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206 despite his failure to articulate the relevance of the evidence with any clarity); secondly as evidence they might take into account as an explanation for why the complainant was confused about the dates and times the subject offences were committed thereby explaining the need for her to give a revised series of statements to police from November 2008 to October 2009; and thirdly to explain the delay in complaint.   
58The second and third categories (evidence not amounting to sexual misconduct in the physical sense) included the appellant invading the complainant's privacy while showering and dressing; criticising her style of dress; restricting her access to her mobile phone and his generalised bad character as evidenced by what the Crown submitted was his loss of temper and by his threats of violence and excessive physical violence when disciplining his son.  Although the incident involving the suspected lumps on the complainant's breasts, and the shower incidents and walking into the complainant's bedroom whilst she was changing carried with them an unmistakable sexual connotation, in his closing address the Crown expressly limited his reliance upon this evidence to show a pattern of behaviour on the appellant's part which extended beyond the legitimate boundaries of parental control and the appellant's inability to control his temper when confronted with issues that frustrated him.  This in turn was said by the Crown to expose what he described as the ""true situation"" in the household and, in that way, to account for her delay in complaint because of what he submitted was the complainant's perception of the appellant's capacity to hurt her in circumstances where her mother was not sufficiently protective or supportive.
59Just as defence counsel did not object to any of this evidence despite the very considerable prejudice capable of being generated by it, neither did he raise any objection to the focus that was given to the evidence in the way the Crown led its case, in the way the appellant was cross-examined and the way it was left to the jury.  In my view, legitimate objection could have been taken (and should have been taken) to much of this evidence as being simply irrelevant to any issue in the trial.  For example, I am simply unable to see any basis for the admission of evidence of the appellant hitting his son with a skipping rope on an isolated occasion (and even less for it to become the subject of such focus in cross-examination over many pages of the transcript and then attracting a lengthy submission from the Crown in closing address), irrespective of whether the appellant hit the child as a result of a momentary loss of temper or to punish him for swearing or a combination of both.  
60The evidence that the appellant verbally threatened to kill his wife if she sought custody of the children on one occasion in the course of what it appears were many heated marital arguments is also of doubtful relevance as context evidence particularly since there was no allegation that any of the acts of sexual misconduct involving the complainant were accompanied by violence, or threats of violence, and that the complainant acquiesced in the sexual assaults for that reason.  In KTR v R [2010] NSWCCA 271 at [99] McClellan CJ at CL said:To my mind, evidence of violence perpetrated by the appellant against the complainants was relevant because it provided a realistic context in which to understand the complainants' evidence. Evidence that a complainant did not resist the appellant or report the assaults to her mother because she believed it to be pointless to resist or was scared or terrified of the appellant's possible response demands an understanding of the context of the prior relationship between the complainant and the appellant. If the relationship is one where the appellant has been violent to the complainant or, to the knowledge of the complainant by his dealings with others, has demonstrated a preparedness to use violence or put others in fear, that event, which places the alleged offences in a realistic context, must be admissible when given by a complainant. However, it may be otherwise if given by a third party.
61Even were some of the evidence admissible as context evidence, some or all of it might nevertheless have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995, were application made to the trial judge.  
62Whether or not defence counsel deliberately refrained from objecting to the evidence in order to ground the submission that the complainant was a disgruntled teenager who had manufactured a case of sexual abuse against her stepfather in retaliation at his attempts to discipline or control her, when evidence of other acts of sexual misconduct by an accused is led by the Crown on the untested assumption that the conduct is relevant to an issue in the trial, there is a very real potential for the evidence to be misused by a jury as evidence tending to proof of the offences charged.  That risk increases where there is insufficient guidance from the trial judge as to its legitimate use or, as has occurred in this case, where the trial judge suggested, or appeared to suggest, that aspects of the context evidence was probative of the appellant's salacious interest in the complainant, and available to support the Crown case that he was guilty of the offences charged on the indictment.   
63Irrespective of what might have been the forensic approach of trial counsel, in order to ensure that the evidence was not misused by the jury the Crown should have been invited by the trial judge to identify the issue to which each aspect of the three categories of so-called context evidence was said to be relevant, and before the evidence was to be led, in order that he might direct the jury at the time of the admission of the evidence as to the limited use to which the jury might put the evidence.  This is the approach that McClellan CJ at CL in Qualtieri at [80] regarded as essential to minimise the risk of prejudice.  The fact that the Crown prosecutor opened his case to the jury and identified the limited use to which some of the evidence was to be put did not absolve the trial judge of the need to carefully direct the jury of the confined use of the evidence at the time the evidence was led.  Because that did not happen in this case, there was a very real risk, perhaps elevated in this case to a near certainty, that some of the evidence, in particular the shower incidents, and the considerable focus it attracted had by the end of the trial, created an air of prejudice which judicial direction could not cure. 
The trial judge's directions on context evidence
64In order to appreciate the way the trial miscarried it is necessary to set out the relevant passages of the summing up concerning the context evidence in full:...  Now in addition to the evidence that the Crown led directly to support the allegation pertaining to each of the two counts the Crown has led evidence of other acts of alleged misconduct by the accused of a sexual nature towards the complainant.  For the sake of convenience I will simply refer to that evidence as being other acts.  Just as a phrase.  Those other acts include perving on her when she was naked in the bathroom, and her bedroom and touching her on various parts of her body; breasts, bottom, vagina.
(Neither counsel had used this expression in dealing with the shower and bedroom incidents.  Although the Crown prosecutor was at pains in his address to the jury to make it plain that the incidents were not to be used to show any sexual inclination, the cross-examination at [51] suggests otherwise.)  
65While the use of the term ""perving"" in the above extract might have been an idiomatic slip of the tongue, given the way the trial judge questioned the appellant about his insistence on using the shower in the passage extracted at [50] above, and his summary of the Crown submissions concerning this evidence in the following extracts (again contrary to the way in which the Crown sought to use the evidence), the jury would have been left in no doubt that in the judge's view the evidence was supportive of the appellant's guilt and that they could use it that way if they were satisfied that the appellant's behaviour towards the complainant was unacceptable or inappropriate.
66His Honour went on to say:It is important that I explain to you the relevance of that evidence of other acts.  It is admitted solely for the purpose of placing the complainant's evidence regarding the two acts relied on for counts 1 and 2 into what the Crown says is a realistic context, now you have heard some submissions in relation to this from the Crown.  The reality is that without that material, you may wonder about the likelihood of two apparently isolated events, namely count 1 and count 2, occurring suddenly and without apparent reason.  If a complainant gave evidence of isolated acts of sexual misconduct you would be entitled to think it very odd for there to have been two such isolated acts if a person was touching her that way would it only happen twice and some time apart.  So if you had not heard evidence of the other acts, you may have thought the complainant's evidence was less credible.
...
Now if however, the particular acts relied on for counts 1 and 2 are placed into the wider context, that is into the context of an ongoing history then that curious feature of two isolated acts would disappear.  It is for that reason that the law permits a wider sexual history to be provided, it is to avoid artificiality or unreality in the presentation of evidence.  For one or two incidents to be artificially isolated and selected and for a witness to be confined to them, could make it very difficult for her to proceed intelligently with her evidence, to pick out for example two incidents separated by lengthy periods could leave you with a very strange and unrealistic account.  Therefore it is open to the Crown to lead evidence of other acts of a sexual nature between the accused and the complainant as I have identified.
However, I must give you some important warnings in relation to this evidence of other acts.  You must not use this evidence of other acts as establishing a tendency on the part of the accused to commit offences of this type.  You must not substitute the evidence of other acts for the evidence of the specific offences on the indictment.  So you cannot say well he put his finger in her vagina on some other occasion but I do not think he actually did it in count 2, but because I find he did it on another occasion and notwithstanding I do not think he did it in this one, I am going to find him guilty any way.  If he is to be found guilty of count 2 it has to be that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what is alleged on count 2 is what took place, not in relation to some other incident.  So no substitution.  You must not reason that because the accused may have done something wrong to the complainant on another occasion he must have done so on the occasions alleged in the indictment.
67It was common ground on the appeal that this direction was in accordance with the Bench Book.  However, when his Honour dealt with the issue of the complainant's credibility and the reliability of her account, that direction was undermined:The Crown says, while there is no support for the complainant in terms of what actually happened in relation to count 1 and count 2 in the sense that nobody saw it, there is support for other material that you might have expected that there should be support for.  For instance, there is support for her version about him coming into the shower, support that he indeed unlocked the door and came into the shower, support that he was getting into the shower with her, support that he would come into her bedroom and support for her when she made reference to the issue with the lump and how he just lifted up her shirt to expose her breasts and support for her in terms of the skipping rope incident.  So the Crown says you look to the evidence of the mother and it supports her in those areas where you would expect that she would be supported and while it does not support her in relation to count 1 and count 2, all of that material provides a background against which you can see what is happening within that home.  It is perhaps the case of a man using excuses such as, ""I need to have a shower"", ""I've got to go to work"" or ""I'm in a hurry"", or ""you're taking too long"".  Using that type of excuse to get into the bathroom to see this young lady in a naked condition.  That he used other things such as impatience to cover up the underlying sexual issues that he was having in relation to this young girl.
68His Honour went on to say:The issue with the controlling of her behaviour.  Well he seems to be at odds with the mother in the sense that the mother was not too fussed by whatever was occurring with the mobile phone, her daughter or even the manner of dress.  The Crown says, when you look at what his attitude in going into the bathroom, that to go into the bathroom even for impatience when it is a sixteen or fifteen or fourteen year old girl who is naked in there, who has locked the door obviously wanting to keep people out, that there has to be some awareness that it is an inappropriate thing to be doing.  And the Crown says when you look at what he says about that, and his controlling behaviour, how it is one thing for him to lift up her shirt and expose her breasts but apparently then he is critical of her wearing a top that is too revealing when she goes out.  He is concerned about her contact with boys.  Well you know that is probably the concern of most fathers or stepfathers through teen years.  But then there is concern and there is concern.  Look at the length to which he will go to take the mobile phone from her and then to take that mobile phone to a doctor, talk to a doctor about it.  The Crown says you would look at all of that; you would look at the way in which he gave his evidence and the Crown says you would not accept what he says about it, you would not accept his denials, you would accept the complainant because the Crown says she is a witness of truth and where it is possible for her to be supported by her mother.
69The appellant submitted that despite the Crown expressly limiting its reliance upon the acts of sexual misconduct which were not the subject of either count on the indictment, and limiting the use to which it put other aspects of the appellant's inappropriate behaviour, not only did the trial judge wrongly attribute to the Crown a submission that the appellant's behaviour in entering the bathroom was inappropriate because she was naked, he also wrongly attributed to the Crown a submission that where the complainant's evidence was corroborated by her mother, it could be used to support the complainant's credibility generally.  The appellant submitted that for the trial judge to leave this evidence to the jury as capable of supporting the complainant's reliability and truthfulness was in breach of the credibility rule in s 102 of the Evidence Act.
70The appellant further submitted that even if the credibility rule was not breached, the judge's error in attributing to the Crown reliance on the evidence for an implicit tendency purpose was compounded when, of his own volition, he suggested the shower incident revealed a sexualised or obsessive attitude toward her thereby effectively suggesting a tendency on the part of the appellant to commit the offences with which he was charged.
Was it permissible for the trial judge to invite the jury to use the evidence to bolster the complainant's credibility?
71The credibility rule in s 102 of the Evidence Act operates to exclude evidence that is relevant solely to a witness' (or a person's) credibility.  Evidence is not irrelevant only because it relates to the credibility of a witness (s 51(2)).  Evidence that is relevant for another purpose is not excluded although it may be subject to exclusion by reason of its lack of probative value and unfair prejudice pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act. 
72In Peacock v R [2008] NSWCCA 264; 190 A Crim R 454 Simpson J, in discussing the operation of the credibility rule emphasised the distinction that needs to be drawn between evidence going to the credibility of a witness and evidence going to the credibility of the evidence given by that witness or, as her Honour more accurately described it, evidence going to the reliability of the evidence given by a witness. 
73At [57] her Honour said:...Section 102 prohibits evidence going only to the former: it does not prohibit evidence going only to the latter of which an obvious example is evidence contradicting facts asserted by a witness.  The reliability of evidence given by a witness might be challenged by evidence contradicting all, or part, of that witness's evidence.  That contradictory evidence is not rendered inadmissible by s 102.
74In the present case, of course, the evidence from the complainant's mother when she detailed the shower incidents, the skipping rope incident and the occasion when lumps were detected on her breasts (the evidence the appellant submitted was left to the jury in breach of the credibility rule), was not evidence contradicting the facts asserted by the complainant, evidence which would, on any view, have been properly admitted to undermine the reliability of her evidence concerning these incidents, it was evidence having the contrary effect, namely evidence generally consistent with the complainant's evidence about those incidents thereby supporting the reliability of her evidence.  It was precisely in that way that the trial judge suggested that the evidence given by the complainant of those incidents was supported where, by way of contrast, there was no support for her evidence of being sexually assaulted.  I am not persuaded that this direction breached the credibility rule. 
75I am also not persuaded that the jury's use of the context evidence to support the complainant's credibility as a witness was impermissible.  In Qualtieri at [119] Howie J recognised the legitimate use to which context evidence might be put in bolstering the credibility of a complainant (views with which Latham J expressly agreed):[119]  Both context evidence and tendency evidence can bolster the credibility of the complainant but they do so in different ways. Context evidence is relevant to the credibility of the complainant only in that his or her version of the particular incident which is the basis of the charge in the indictment may be more capable of belief when seen in the context of what the complainant says was his or her sexual relationship with the accused. It may explain, on the complainant's version, why the accused and the complainant acted as they did in circumstances where without the context of the relationship those acts might be inexplicable. But other than generally assisting the complainant's credibility in this way, context evidence does not make the complainant's account more reliable than it would be in the absence of that evidence. Context evidence does not make it more likely that the accused committed any of the offences charged in the indictment. 
[120]  Tendency evidence on the other hand is direct evidence relevant to the commission of the offence charged. If accepted by the jury, it makes it more likely that the offence charged was committed by the accused. It bolsters the complainant's credibility because her version is more likely to be true if the accused has a tendency to behave in the way she alleges he did on specific occasions.
76However, by attributing to the Crown the submission that the jury would find that the complainant's version of how she was mistreated by the appellant more likely to be true, referable to what the trial judge suggested was the appellant's underlying sexual interest in the complainant (which the jury might find he attempted to ""cover up"" with a series of excuses and by the unnecessary lengths that he went to control her) he has invited the jury to use that evidence for an impermissible tendency purpose.  In addition, when he commented in the extract at [68] above, ""But there is concern and there is concern"" he could only be taken to be inviting the jury to question the appellant's stated concern being that of a supervising parent as distinct from a parent with a prurient sexual interest in his stepdaughter.  In that way, and despite his Honour's directions that the evidence provided a background for what was happening in the home, and despite the directions as to the limited use of the context evidence he had given earlier in the summing up and which displayed no error, at the conclusion of the summing up the jury were being effectively invited to use the context evidence to show a propensity or characteristic of the accused, a use to which it can never be legitimately put.  
77It is perhaps unsurprising that error of this kind infected the summing up given the failure on the part of both counsel and the trial judge to adopt the disciplined approach to the Crown's intention to lead context evidence that this Court, in Qualtieri and cases since then, has repeatedly stipulated is the proper approach being designed to ensure that context evidence is used for the legitimate purpose of enabling the jury to appreciate that the charged offences were not committed in a vacuum, or otherwise as relevant to proof of a fact in issue, and not for an illegitimate tendency purpose. 
78Given the very real potential for this evidence, and the way it was dealt with in the context of the trial generally, to have been productive of a miscarriage of justice, I am satisfied that although trial counsel failed to seek redirections, leave should be granted under Rule 4 to permit the ground to be argued and the appeal allowed. 
Ground 3(b):  The trial judge erred in failing to give a direction concerning the limited use of the evidence of the complainant's mother concerning the appellant's demeanour on the occasion he was seen by her to leave the complainant's bedroom
79This ground of appeal concerns evidence led from the complainant's mother of an occasion on Halloween in 2008 when, without her knowledge, the appellant had slept in the complainant's room and when, as she described it, he came out of her room one morning with:... his head down and I said to him ""what's wrong, what's happened"" and he just looked down and didn't answer me.
80No objection was taken to the evidence on the grounds of relevance or, if relevant, because its probative value was outweighed by unfair prejudice.  This is difficult to understand since neither of the offences charged on the indictment concerned conduct on or around Halloween in 2008, and the complainant did not give evidence that the appellant had slept overnight in her room at or about that time, much less that he had slept overnight and sexually assaulted her.  Whilst she said in cross-examination that many other assaultive incidents she claimed to be victim to had happened in her bedroom, and that she was unable to remember the detail of any of those occasions, she did not give evidence that any occurred within a month of her making complaint in November 2008.  Her evidence concerning the appellant's conduct in or around October 2008 was limited to the occasion when the appellant opportunistically assaulted her when she was in her parents' bedroom to say goodnight.  In addition, when she gave evidence that the appellant entered the bathroom three or four times a week it was not clear whether she was alleging that he followed her into her bedroom with that degree of frequency.  In any event, the evidence from the complainant's mother was clearly referable to an occasion when she understood the appellant to be leaving the complainant's bedroom after he had slept in the bedroom overnight, not leaving the bedroom after having followed her there after she had taken her morning shower. 
81Neither counsel referred to this aspect of the evidence in their closing addresses and the trial judge did not refer to it in his summing up.  It only came into focus when the jury sent a note after retiring to consider their verdicts.  In somewhat oblique terms, the note read:Transcript on entry to [the complainant's] room.  Ever.
82In discussion with counsel, the note was interpreted to mean that the jury were seeking guidance as to the source of evidence generally on the topic of the occasions when the appellant entered the complainant's bedroom.  Thereafter, the various references in the evidence to that general topic were extracted and the jury reminded of them, including the evidence from the complainant's mother about the ""Halloween incident"".  The trial judge also reminded the jury of the appellant's evidence denying that he had ever entered complainant's bedroom when she was naked, and his explanation that the ""Halloween incident"" (which he could not recall) was likely to be an occasion when he may have been carrying his other daughter from the complainant's bedroom.  
83No directions were sought at that time, or at any earlier time, as to the limited use the jury could put this evidence.  The trial judge did not refer to it as part of the context evidence in the summing up although that was the only conceivable basis upon which it might have been admitted.  The appellant now complains that the trial judge should have told the jury that they could not use the evidence as evidencing a consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant, or be used by them to reason to proof of guilt, and that the failure to do so constitutes a miscarriage of justice.  
84Were the trial judge's directions concerning context evidence otherwise free of error, the failure to give any specific direction about this aspect of the evidence, particularly where there was no challenge to its admission or application for redirection, would not, in my view, have attracted a grant of leave under Rule 4 to permit the ground of appeal to be argued. 
Ground 1:  The trial judge failed to properly put the defence case
85It was submitted that the trial judge's summary of the defence case by reference only to counsel's arguments and not the appellant's evidence in circumstances where it is said that the Crown case and the complainant's evidence were referred to at some length, resulted in a summing up that lacked balance, thereby depriving the appellant of a fair trial. 
86The obligation of a trial judge is to ensure that the respective cases of the prosecution and the accused are fairly and accurately put, consistent with the ultimate objective of ensuring that the jury has a sufficient appreciation of the evidence, and the arguments for or against acceptance of the evidence, to enable them to discharge their duty of returning a verdict in accordance with the evidence. 
87In some trials, in particular those that involve a single count or where only one of a number of elements of a particular charge is in dispute, a summary of the arguments of counsel is often sufficient to ensure the jury understand the defence case in answer to the case brought by the Crown.  Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 expressly provides that the extent to which the trial judge needs to summarise the evidence depends upon an assessment of the circumstances of the particular trial.  While in an appropriate case the section relieves the trial judge of summarising the evidence it does not relieve the judge of the obligation to put the accused's case to the jury (see Wong at [141]).
88The assessment as to whether, and to what extent, the evidence needs to be summarised depends not only upon the particular charge or charges on the indictment, but also on the length of the trial and the matters that remain in dispute when the cases for the prosecution and accused have closed.  Where it is the intention of the trial judge to summarise only select aspects of the evidence, it is prudent to seek counsel's views as to whether any other aspects of the evidence should also be referred to or extracted.  Where counsel considers that the evidence generally or in a particular respect has been underemphasised, or that the summing up otherwise lacks balance by an overemphasis of some evidence or argument about it at the expense of other evidence, there is an obligation to seek further directions at that time.  The failure to do so signifies to an appeal Court (or might signify in the absence of explanation) that in counsel's assessment, in the immediacy of the atmosphere of the trial, the summing up was sufficient to bring to the jury's attention the evidence in the accused's case (or evidence in the Crown case favouring the accused's case) and the arguments put by counsel about it.
89When there is a complaint on appeal that a trial judge either failed to properly put the defence case or that the summing up lacked balance resulting in an unfair trial, the attention given to the Crown and defence cases by reference to a crude page count in the summing up is neither helpful nor definitive.  To the extent that this ground of appeal depends upon the appellant's submission that the defence case occupied ""over two and a half pages in a 25 page summing up"", it is not made out.  It is not infrequently the case that additional time is taken in a summing up to deal with the evidence in the Crown case, if for no other reason than to discharge the trial judge's duty to identify the elements of the offence or offences and the available evidence to prove them.  Less frequently will there be the need to spend unequal time on the arguments of counsel, although that will also depend upon the nature of the trial and the issues that are left for the jury to resolve in considering their verdict.  
90It was essential that the trial judge in this case identify the constituent elements of the offences and the complainant's evidence going to proof of those elements, including the issue of consent.  He did this economically without referring to the complainant's evidence in any great detail and without quoting her evidence at all.  At repeated points in that exercise he reminded the jury of the accused's evidence denying the assaults.  He also emphasised the Crown's obligation to prove its case and that it was not for the accused to prove he did not assault the complainant or for the jury to choose between the competing versions.   
91Despite there being no evidence supporting the complainant's version, and in this sense it was a case of word on word, I am not persuaded that it was necessary for the trial judge to quote the accused's denials as counsel on the appeal contended.  The jury could have been in no doubt that he denied the allegations of sexual assault and other sexual misconduct.  While it would have been open and perhaps preferable to remind the jury of the cross-examination of the complainant where she was tested about the delay in complaint, her various and inconsistent accounts to police, and the fact that they each occurred in a family home, the trial judge's summary of counsel's submissions about these issues was sufficient to remind the jury of the appellant's case.
92Where the summing up lacked adequate balance was in the treatment his Honour gave to the appellant's evidence in answer to aspects of the context evidence.  Although the trial judge summarised counsel's arguments directed to challenging the credibility of the complainant's evidence about the other allegations of misconduct by reference to her feisty demeanour and her attitude to being disciplined by the appellant, he dealt with the appellant's evidence concerning these incidents in a most cursory way.  
93Because I am satisfied that the appeal should be upheld because of the trial judge's directions when dealing with the context evidence, it is not strictly necessary to decide whether leave under Rule 4 would have been granted and the appeal allowed on this ground alone.  
Ground 2:  The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury concerning the way in which the evidence of juveniles should be assessed
94In that part of the summing up where his Honour alerted the jury in conventional terms to the need to consider the reliability of witnesses, including their truthfulness, accuracy and demeanour, he dealt at length with the evidence of children: All witnesses have markedly different levels - especially children - of intellectual sophistication and that can impact upon their ability to give evidence and handle cross-examination.  Young people often have different thought processes.  They have a different sense of logic.  What they think might be a very logical thing to do but may not be what you as an adult think of as a very logical thing to do.
I have heard children give evidence and say things and you are thinking - your adult mind is thinking, ""Well that doesn't make any sense"", and then you get an answer and you think, ""Aah, that's why they said that, that's how they were thinking that through.  It's a process different to the one I'm applying"".  I mean you know it yourselves when someone says something and you think, ""Hang on a sec, I never thought of it like that"", it's just another example of that, that not every mind works in the same way or follows the same process of logic and thought and especially with children, and then again it very much might depend upon their level of maturity.
I mean some girls, for instance, at fifteen might be as physically mature as they are ever going to be, but they might be fifteen going on thirty-five one minute and fifteen going on about ten the next.  Boys would be even worse.  They are very rarely fifteen going on thirty, they are usually fifteen, if they are lucky, going on fifteen, or fifteen going on about three.  It does not change much until they get to about twenty-five, I think, but it just emphasises the fact that, as between children there is a huge range of abilities and even with the same child.
From one moment it can be a mature moment to a completely immature moment a little bit later.  So level of maturity, level of understanding, they have a lower ability to focus and concentrate.  They are often more easily distracted.  They have different levels of knowledge, for instance, different levels of understanding, for instance, of sexual matters, especially.  They can be very naïve to very worldly wise.  They have significantly greater language issues.
I mean it is bad enough when the lawyers tend to use words within a courtroom that we understand or everyone who is regularly here understands because you hear them all the time, but it is probably like going to a government meeting, unless you know what the A, B, C and the J, Y, K and the L, M, B and half the time you cannot understand the language because they give these acronyms to every single thing.  You go to some other work site and they will use terminology generic to that work site.  If you are not familiar with it you will not understand it, and a court room is the same.  Even though we attempt, I think, on most occasions to try and get rid of that jargon, it still occurs.
So young people have a bigger problem in that their vocabulary has not yet developed, it is not as large as it will be when they are adults, so they are unfamiliar with words that perhaps are not even peculiar to a court, but more used perhaps among the adult population than the juvenile population.  I mean sometimes there is just a complete breakdown.  If I talk about someone being sick it means something completely different to what a fifteen year old boy from Bankstown thinks ""sick"" means.  For that kid you can even be ""fully sick"".
So language can produce difficulties and you need to bear it in mind, difficulties in terms of understanding, difficulties in terms of being able to express themselves and often they are a little too embarrassed to put their hand up and say, ""No, I didn't quite understand that"".  So, again, that is the background against which you make the assessment.  Puberty can be a very big thing.
Puberty can often lead to emotions and tensions, for instance, especially within families.  Most witnesses and especially children have trouble handling the ambiguous or double barrelled question or as we heard one, the double negative.  I think that was an adult witness who had trouble with that double negative, ""not infrequently"", I think it was, from memory, and lawyers do tend to use those double negatives, not infrequently.  So you need again to be careful, take that into account.
The evidence of a young person should be assessed against the background that if the allegations are true, which is ultimately the question for you, but if they are true then it is necessary for that child or young person to effectively relive what they say occurred to them.  That may well mean opening up old wounds, and you have to have it in the context that if these things did happen there may be degrees of wanting to forget it and put it behind you and move on.  Obviously if it is lies, you do not have such a problem.  If you are telling lies you are not being quite so personal about what you are discussing.  So while ultimately it is for you at the end of the day to determine whether the allegations are true, you need to bear in mind that if in fact they are that may well have an impact on the way the evidence is given because it could involve, as I say, the opening of old wounds or of memories that have been avoided, I guess, not wanting to think about that sort of thing.  So emotions or the demonstration of emotions are an important factor for you to look at, but again not everybody reacts emotionally the same way.
Here I think the reality is that [the complainant] was quite controlled.  She was generally in control of her emotions when she gave her evidence, and you might recall when I read to you the statement of [the school teacher] that in that statement the school teacher ... says that, ""She's always known [the complainant] to be a child that didn't really show a lot of emotion"".  So again that goes into the mix.
95The complaint is not that his Honour's remarks breached the prohibition in s 165A of the Evidence Act although parts of the extract above are, in my view, capable of such a reading.  That section operates to prohibit a trial judge from warning a jury that children as a class, or by reason of their immaturity, are unreliable witnesses, or that their evidence is less credible or reliable or that it requires more careful scrutiny than the evidence of adults. The complaint is that the trial judge's commentary had the potential to deflect the jury from their task of assessing the complainant's credibility.  
96In my view that complaint is well founded.  Despite defence counsel's failure to ask his Honour to make clear to the jury that his views about child witnesses were by way of comment only and that they were not obliged to assess the complainant's evidence by reference to them, the extent of his Honour's commentary and its content, coupled with the real risk that the jury might have been inclined to a view adverse to the accused because of it, satisfies me that leave should be granted to permit this ground of appeal to be argued.   
97A trial judge has a wide discretion to offer guidance to a jury as to how to approach the evidence of a child witness which should be tailored to meet the particular circumstances of the case and the issues that the jury are likely to encounter in their deliberations.  Save only where a trial judge is satisfied that the evidence of a particular child may be unreliable in a particular respect, and that there is a need for the jury to exercise caution in assessing the evidence thereby invoking the exception in s 165A(2) of the Evidence Act, it is important that a trial judge refrain from suggesting an approach to the assessment of a child's evidence in such a way that it has the appearance of a direction of law.  
98In NJB v R [2010] NTCCA 05 a conviction was overturned where the trial judge had said the following:First, I am going to talk to you, in a general sense, about the weight which may be given to the evidence of children. Courts now recognise the following factors in relation to the evidence of children:
1. While children generally do not experience full cognitive development until about the age of 14 years, children, even children of tender years, can give reliable evidence if questions are tailored to their cognitive development.
2. From about the age of six onwards children do not have a less accurate memory than adults. However, recall is more likely to decline with time for children than for adults and children are likely to recount, when describing past events, in much less detail than adults.
3. Children do have the ability to distinguish fact and fantasy and the danger of children fabricating allegations without the encouragement of older persons is no different to that of adults. However, children are suggestible and on occasion like everyone else they do tell lies.
4. With younger children recall is less likely to be organised because of the level of their cognitive development and because of underdevelopment of concepts such as time, space and distance. The spontaneous collating and organisation of recall is a learned skill which improves as language skills, vocabulary and cognitive development improve.
5. Children may experience difficulty in supplying information at a particular time, or in a particular place, or in an unusual or formal situation. Stress and anxiety may inhibit the capacity of a child to supply information at a particular point in time.
So far as courts are concerned, the days when children were considered to be incapable of giving reliable evidence are long gone.
99The Court held that the critical question is how the jury would have understood the remarks.  They went on to say:[11] ... If it is possible that the jury would have understood that they were required to assess the evidence of the children in accordance with what the trial Judge had said, the trial Judge would have impinged impermissibly upon the function of the jury as the sole arbiters of the facts.
[12] The remarks in question were given at the outset of the summing up. They were expressed in firm and direct terms. Notwithstanding that his Honour told the jury that he was going to talk to the jury ""in a general sense about the weight which may be given to the evidence of children"", and notwithstanding later directions that the weight to be given to the evidence of the children was a matter for the jury and the jury alone, the remarks presented the five numbered propositions as the incontrovertible view of the court. The presentation of this view was not hedged with any qualification. Nor was it hedged with a direct or indirect statement or implication that it was a matter for the jury whether the jury agreed or disagreed with the five propositions. There was no hint given that it was within the province of the jury to reject any or all of the propositions as the jury saw fit.
100In CMG v R [2011] VSCA 416 the Court had occasion to consider how a trial judge might legitimately deal with counsel's submissions which were directed to suggesting that the jury should consider particular aspects of a child's evidence unreliable or unworthy of weight in light of the different cognitive functioning of a child, their susceptibility to suggestion and desire to appease adults and their tendency to confuse reality and fantasy.  At [10] the Court confirmed that the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the jury needed to be told that counsel's views, while properly presented as arguments, were not evidence, and that the jury needed to be presented with a somewhat nuanced picture from the trial judge including that it is the collective experience of the courts that the age of a witness is not determinative of his or her ability to give truthful and accurate evidence.  However, in so doing, the Court determined that the trial judge cast her remarks as directions of law, some of which she claimed were informed by academic study and research, and in that way she exceeded her judicial function and entered the arena.  In the result the conviction was overturned.  The Court referred to the following extract from R v Barker [2010] EWCA Crim 4, a judgment of the English Court of Appeal, with approval:Like adults some children will provide truthful and accurate testimony, and some will not. However children are not miniature adults, but children, and to be treated and judged for what they are, not what they will, in years ahead, grow to be. Therefore, although due allowance must be made in the trial process for the fact that they are children with, for example, a shorter attention span than most adults, none of the characteristics of childhood, and none of the special measures which apply to the evidence of children, carry with them the implicit stigma that children should be deemed in advance to be somehow less reliable than adults. The purpose of the trial process is to identify the evidence which is reliable and that which is not, whether it comes from an adult or a child ... In a trial by jury, his or her credibility is to be assessed by the jury, taking into account every specific personal characteristic which may bear on the issue of credibility, along with the rest of the available evidence.
101While their Honours did not endorse the extract as a template, they observed that had the trial judge responded to counsel's address by the inclusion of the substance of what the Court of Appeal in Barker observed, no complaint could have been made.
102While in the present case his Honour's observations about children speaking and thinking differently from adults might have been classed as legitimate comment, I am satisfied they were overtaken by other observations sourcing from his Honour's personal experience and personal views about children such that there was a blurring of the essential distinction between a judicial direction and a comment.  Some of his Honour's remarks could only have been understood as directions given the imperative language in which they were expressed.  The most serious of these being the requirement that the jury were to assess the complainant's evidence against the background that if she was being truthful she might find difficulty giving her evidence because she was reliving the assaultive experience in the process.  This direction had the effect of inviting the jury to find that defence counsel's submissions about her demeanour in the witness box were of no weight in undermining her credibility.  Other observations were nothing more than his Honour's personal views about the complainant but which were again cast in terms that would have signalled to the jury in unmistakeable terms that his Honour regarded her as a reliable witness.  To describe her as someone who was in fact in control of her emotions while giving evidence (in effect despite her inner turmoil as a victim of the assaults) far exceeded the bounds of permissible comment in a case where the credibility of the complainant was a significant and contentious issue.  In Mahmood v State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 1; 232 CLR 397 the importance of maintaining the distinction between comment and direction was emphasised at [16]: The distinction between a direction and a comment by a trial judge is referred to in Azzopardi v R.  It reflects the fundamental division of functions in a criminal trial between the judge and the jury.  The distinction is important.  Telling a jury that they may attach particular significance to a fact, or in this case suggesting that other evidence may be considered of greater weight, is comment.  Because it is comment it may be ignored by the jury, a matter about which the jury should be told.  A direction, on the other hand, may contain warnings about the care needed in assessing some evidence or the use to which it may be put.  A direction is something which the law requires the trial judge to give to the jury and which they must heed.

2759259,R v Williams [2012] NSWSC 520,"remarks on sentence
1HIS HONOUR:  The offender, Shain Richard Williams, was charged with the murder of Rodney Jenkins at Coffs Harbour on 22 October 2009.  His plea of guilty to manslaughter has been accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of that indictment.  By that plea he admits having killed Mr Jenkins by an unlawful and dangerous act, but without the intention to kill or to inflict really serious bodily harm.
Facts
2Mr Jenkins, the deceased, was 59 years old.  He lived alone at a caravan park in Coffs Harbour.  During the afternoon of 22 October 2009, he was drinking with Barry Gration and Stephen Parsons at a tavern in Coffs Harbour, and later at the caravan park where he lived.  At about 4.30pm Mr Gration and Mr Parsons left the caravan park and went to a unit in Nambucca Avenue, Coffs Harbour.  
3The offender lived and worked in Coffs Harbour.  After work that day, he also went to the unit.  Mr Gration and Mr Parsons were there.  Also in the unit were his father, Trevor Williams, and a woman named Katrina Thorburn-Simpson.  All of them except Ms Thorburn-Simpson were drinking beer.
4While they were at the unit, Mr Gration expressed concern about the way that Trevor Williams was treating Ms Thorburn-Simpson.  He eventually called the police.  However, before the police arrived, Mr Gration drove Ms Thorburn-Simpson and Mr Parsons to the caravan park where the deceased lived.  They went to the van which he occupied.
5Police attended the unit at Nambucca Avenue but, after getting no response there, they drove to the caravan park.  At this stage it was about 8.25pm.  They spoke to Ms Thorburn-Simpson, who told them that she did not want any action taken against Trevor Williams.  They did not see either Trevor Williams or the offender at the caravan park, and they left.
6After this, Mr Gration drove from the caravan park to buy a carton of beer.  The offender and his father arrived and spoke to a number of people at the deceased's van.  The offender had a baseball bat.  Mr Gration returned to the caravan park and parked his car adjacent to the deceased's van.  As he did so, the offender walked towards the driver's side of the car, holding the baseball bat.  Mr Gration tried to open the driver's door to get out of the car, but the offender forced the door closed.  The driver's window was open, and the offender pushed the tip of the bat through the window, striking Mr Gration twice to the left side of his jaw.  As he did so, he said, ""Fuck with my old man, you fuck with me.""
7Mr Parsons and another man, Scott McMahon, moved towards the car and, shortly thereafter, so did the deceased.  As the deceased approached, the offender stepped back, moved the baseball bat over his right shoulder and swung it in the motion of a baseball hit in the direction of the deceased.  It struck the deceased to the right side of his head and he immediately fell to the ground, where he remained motionless.
8The police were called.  The offender and his father left the caravan park before they arrived.  Ambulance officers also arrived, at 9.37pm.  The deceased was unconscious and obviously suffering from a head wound.  He was transferred to Coffs Harbour Base Hospital, and then to The Royal North Shore Hospital.  A severe traumatic brain injury was diagnosed, such that it was accepted that he would not survive.  He died at 1.56am on 24 October 2009.  
9A post-mortem was conducted two days later by a forensic pathologist, Professor Duflou.  There was a skull fracture and a brain injury, and the cause of death was found to be blunt force head trauma.  Professor Duflou was of the view that a moderate degree of force using a baseball bat would be required to cause the fracture.  It was his opinion that the fall to the ground may have contributed to the brain injury, but the majority of that injury was likely to have been caused by the direct blow to the head by the bat.
10After the offender had left the scene he went to his girlfriend's home.  The following morning he went to work, where he was spoken to by police.  He denied having been at the caravan park at the relevant time.  He claimed to have seen his father at a Woolworths store, but had been at home by 6.00pm and had remained there until the next day.  He was charged and has remained in custody since his arrest, that is, from 23 October 2009.
Subjective case
11The offender was 26 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 29.  He has a criminal history, the most significant previous conviction being one of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death, committed on 12 June 2004.  He had driven a car in which a friend of his was a passenger after he had been drinking.  He collided with a power pole and his friend was killed.  In June 2005, he was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for 4 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.  Otherwise, his criminal history comprises two driving offences, one of them being high range PCA.  
12He has a younger sister.  He had a disturbed upbringing.  His parents were alcoholics and both of them abused drugs.  They separated when he was about 5, and his father moved to Western Australia.  He and his sister lived with their maternal grandparents.  He did not see his father again until his early teens, when he lived with him for about 2 years in the Coffs Harbour area.  His father was violent towards him, and he left and returned to live with his grandparents, at that time in Casino.  From the age of 16 he had mainly been living independently around the Coffs Harbour and Casino areas.  
13He had remained close to his grandparents, who had provided him with a stable and loving home environment.  His maternal grandfather died in 2003, but he maintained contact with his grandmother.  He also continues to have contact with his sister, with whom he has a positive relationship.  
14His paternal grandparents also assisted in his care.  They provided a statement to me, in which they frankly acknowledged the unfortunate upbringing the offender had had with his father, their son, and his mother.  As they put it, ""Shain and his sister Elisha were interruptions to their parents' day, and to their parents' drug and alcohol use.""  They also acknowledged their son's physical abuse of the offender which, apparently, was of longstanding.  They expressed the view that, nevertheless, the offender had sought his father's acceptance and approval until the tragic incident at the caravan park.  They wrote that since that time he has decided that he should have nothing to do with his father, a view shared by them and by his sister.  They added that they had never known him to be violent.
15I also received a statement by his sister, who lives with her partner and children in Kyogle.  She and her partner offer him accommodation with them upon his release, and employment in her partner's business.  She wrote, ""I think it will be best for Shain to be in a stable environment with family and good influences so he has the support and encouragement he will need.""
16He was educated to year 10 standard.  He has a creditable employment history and has achieved a number of trade qualifications.  He has taken up opportunities for employment while in custody.  Prior to his arrest he had had an intermittent relationship with a woman but, generally, he appears to have led a solitary life.  Clearly, the opportunity to live with his sister and her family in Kyogle and pursue employment there would be a significant benefit to him.
17A report by Ms Kathryn Wakely, forensic psychologist, reveals a significant history of the use of alcohol and cannabis.  The offender told her that he had used both on the day in question.  She considered that they were likely to have had some impact upon him, although she did not think that they had played ""a distinct causal role in the offence"".  Ms Wakely did not think that he had become dependent on alcohol, but saw his use of it as problematic, noting its role in his previous offences.  She also considered that he had little insight into the significance of his substance use.  

18From personality testing Ms Wakely concluded that he was likely to act impulsively and, when challenged, ""may react with impulsive anger.""  She saw the offence as consistent with that profile.  She concluded that he would benefit from an anger management program, which would assist him to manage ""his emotions, anger, and behavioural responses more appropriately.""  She added that he would benefit from assistance to address his use of alcohol and cannabis.  She recommended that he participate in programs available while in custody, and that there should be ""close and consistent monitoring"" by the Probation and Parole service upon his release.

19An affidavit of the offender was read, in which he sketched his background, his employment and his aspirations upon his release.  He said that he would welcome the assistance of his sister and brother-in-law, and that he wished to settle down and not get into any more trouble.  He also expressed his remorse for his crime, apologising to the family and loved ones of the deceased for what he had done, as well as expressing his regret for having lied to the police about the matter.

Sentencing
20None of this is to deny the seriousness of this offence.  The offender armed himself with a baseball bat, intending to confront Mr Gration in relation to a perceived slight to his father.  No doubt, the background to this was the ambivalent, perhaps dependent, relationship with his father to which I have referred.  He probably was to some extent disinhibited by alcohol and cannabis but, of course, that is no excuse for his behaviour.  The unfortunate deceased was an entirely innocent bystander, one of a group of men who presumably were coming to Mr Gration's assistance.  The offender bore him no ill will, and why he acted as he did is unclear.  The effect of what he told Ms Wakely was that ""his behaviour was reactive to his fear"" of the approaching men.  
21I accept that his blow with the bat was impulsive.  Moreover, while Ms Wakely considered him prone to impulsive anger when challenged, I accept that this was an uncharacteristic act of violence on his part.  That said, this is yet another case, of a kind that comes all too frequently before the courts, of a spontaneous act of violence, fuelled to a greater or lesser extent by alcohol, with tragic results.  Appropriate weight must be given to deterrence, principally in this case general deterrence.
22The offender has good prospects of rehabilitation.  He has the benefit of familial support and a demonstrated capacity for stable employment.  I accept that he is remorseful, and I think it unlikely that he would re-offend in any serious way.  Nevertheless, it is important that the personal issues identified by Ms Wakely be addressed and, to that end, it is in the interests of the community that he have the opportunity of an extended period of conditional liberty, subject to supervision and the sanction of parole.  Accordingly, I find special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period.
23He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on his arraignment in this court.  There had been committal proceedings in which oral evidence was given.  An offer to plead guilty to manslaughter was conveyed to the Crown at the conclusion of those proceedings.  I shall reduce the sentence otherwise appropriate by 15% for the utilitarian value of the plea.   But for the plea of guilty I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years.  A 15% reduction produces a figure, rounded off, of 6 years.  I shall fix a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, so that the offender will be eligible for release on parole on 22 July 2013.
24Shain Richard Williams, for the offence of manslaughter you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 23 October 2009 and expiring on 22 July 2013, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 23 July 2013 and expiring on 22 October 2015.

2759267,R v Brooks [2012] NSWSC 505,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HER HONOUR:  Between 8.40pm and 9.35pm on 23 October 2009 Jeffrey Ryan was killed at his country property at Duri, 20km south of Tamworth, when the shot fired from a 12 gauge shotgun penetrated his chest and abdomen and the right side of the lower lumbar area, indicating that he was shot from the back and slightly to his right.  He died within minutes from extensive internal injuries.  He was found by a neighbour the following morning face down in the yard not far from a temporary dwelling he was occupying having separated from his wife, Helen Ryan, who occupied the main house on the property with their daughter.  The defendant was aged 48.
2The murder weapon was not recovered.  Ballistics established that two shots were fired over a distance of approximately 10 metres.  The other shot struck a shed. The evidence does not establish which shot was fired first.  The Crown case theory was that the deceased was attracted by the arrival of a car entering his property and went outside to investigate when he was confronted by the killer and that he was shot as he sought to retreat. 
3On 10 February 2010, after an extensive police investigation, this offender was arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased.  His arrest was the culmination of an undercover operation which was launched as part of the wider investigation in which this offender together with the deceased's wife and her mother, Coralie Coulter, were suspects.  On 10 February 2010, Coralie Coulter was also arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased.  Helen Ryan had been charged with his murder on 15 December 2009 but had been released to bail.  On 10 February 2010 her bail was revoked.
4On 14 December 2011 this offender was convicted of murder after trial.  In a separate trial convened before Latham J, Helen Ryan and Coralie Coulter were also convicted of murder.  Helen Ryan was sentenced to imprisonment for 36 years comprised of a non-parole period of 27 years and a balance of term of 9 years and Coralie Coulter to imprisonment for 27 years comprised of a non-parole period of 18 years the balance of term of 9 years.  The statutory ratio was altered in her case because of her age and the probability she would die in gaol (R v Ryan; R v Coulter [2011] NSWSC 1249). 
5Ganene Coulter, Helen Ryan's sister, was also convicted and sentenced for her involvement in the murder.  By her plea of guilty to a conspiracy with her sister and mother to murder the deceased, Ganene Coulter admitted to having arranged with Ian Carroll, a friend of hers, for her sister to be put into contact with a person he knew who would be willing to murder her sister's husband.  Ganene Coulter was sentenced to imprisonment for 11 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months after agreeing to give evidence against her sister, her mother and this offender (see R v Coulter [2011] NSWSC 1176).   
6Principles of parity will influence the sentence to be imposed on this offender.  
7It was not in dispute at the offender's trial that the person who murdered the deceased was contracted by Helen Ryan to have her husband killed and that she did so with the concurrence and active involvement of her mother and her sister.  Ganene Coulter gave evidence that her sister told her that she had met with the man who was to carry out the murder by prearrangement in Tamworth.  She said she had given him a photograph of her husband and that she had transferred $500 into his bank account for expenses.  She said that her sister told her that $30,000 was negotiated as the fee that the contract killer would be paid for the killing, and that a part payment of $15,000 was paid to that person at a prearranged meeting in a park at Murrurundi.  Coralie Coulter gave evidence that she travelled with her daughter, Helen Ryan, to this meeting and that the $15,000 (of which she contributed $10,000) was provided.  She claimed not to have seen who the money was given to. 
8The issue at trial was whether this offender was either the person who shot and killed the deceased or, in the alternative, that he was present when the deceased was shot by an unidentified person knowing that the shooter would discharge the shotgun with the intention of killing the deceased.  The Crown asked that the alternatives be left to the jury because the available forensic evidence did not indicate whether the shooter was alone or in company.  
9I am satisfied for sentencing purposes, and to the criminal standard, that this offender discharged the shotgun and that he acted alone in fulfilment of a cold-blooded plan initiated by Helen Ryan to have her husband killed.  There is simply no evidence to suggest the involvement of anyone other than this offender in the shooting.  The evidence at trial bearing upon that question was overwhelming.  The offender did not give evidence.  
10For sentencing purposes I am also satisfied that the offender's account to police upon his arrest that he did not know anyone called Helen Ryan or Ian Carroll; that he had never been to Tamworth; and that he had lost his mobile phone before the first of literally hundreds of calls passed between his phone and Helen Ryan's phone and his phone and Ian Carroll's phone, was a connected series of lies.  I am satisfied that the comprehensive schedule of telephone calls tendered in the Crown case, which revealed extensive contact between this offender's phone and the phone used by Helen Ryan between about April and October 2009, and on multiple occasions on each of the days immediately preceding the murder and on the day of the murder, was for the purposes of planning for and ultimately finalising arrangements for the murder.  A series of tracked telephone calls between this offender and Helen Ryan and his girlfriend from telephone towers at various locations as he drove from Cessnock to Tamworth on the day of the murder and on the return journey to Cessnock after shooting the deceased, and a similar series of tracked calls on the day that Helen Ryan gave the killer $15,000 as a down payment for the murder, puts this beyond doubt.   
11There was also a number of intercepted telephone calls between this offender and Ian Carroll where, in deliberately coded language, Helen Ryan's arrest in December 2009 was discussed, and in January 2010 further calls, in similarly elliptical language, where tentative arrangements were made for the balance of the contract fee to be paid.  This was further evidence eloquent of this offender's guilt as was the covertly recorded conversation between him and Helen Ryan when undercover police officers, posing as intermediaries, drove an unsuspecting Mrs Ryan to the offender's home in Cessnock in February 2010 when he was given $15,000 in cash in what Helen Ryan believed was an arrangement the intermediaries had made with him to receive that payment.   
12While there was evidence led at trial that Helen Ryan told her sister that she was being mistreated by the deceased and that he had assaulted their daughter and that she wanted him harmed for that reason, I am satisfied that was simply a reflection of her manipulation of the truth to advance her overriding motivation to have her husband killed in retaliation at his withdrawal of affection for her and the transfer of his affection to another woman and to ensure that she would benefit from his death in a greater share than she might otherwise expect from a property settlement following their divorce.  There is no evidence as to what Helen Ryan told this offender was the reason she wanted her husband killed or what he believed might have been her motives.  Even were he to have been told the deceased had abused her or her daughter in some way, the bare and chilling fact is that this offender killed a defenceless man who was a stranger to him for money.  I am also satisfied that he negotiated the terms of that trade and that he was paid $15,000 of the contract fee.  The fact that the balance was paid in the undercover operation four months after the murder cannot be construed as any change of heart on his part.  His concern that he might be implicated in the murder were he to insist on full payment was clear from the way in which he sought to distance himself from Helen Ryan when he learnt of her arrest from Ian Carroll in the intercepted calls in December 2009.
13There is no evidence that Helen Ryan had any involvement in deciding how her husband would be killed or that she furnished the shotgun.  Although the probabilities favour a finding that the ultimate arrangements and manner of death were part of this offender's contractual obligations, I am unable to be satisfied that Helen Ryan did not participate in settling those arrangements to the criminal standard.  It is difficult to understand the need for the frequency of contact between them were that the case.  There is evidence that Helen Ryan was well aware that the offender planned to kill her husband by shooting him at the property on the evening of 23 October 2009 (and, it would seem, leaving him to be found by her the following morning, an arrangement which was interrupted by the untimely arrival of neighbours) and that her contact with the offender that evening by telephone was to confirm that her husband was alone in his living quarters.  I am satisfied, however, that this offender provided the weapon.  Although there is no evidence as to how he secured access to the shotgun or whether the gun was his, that does not carry any particular weight one way or another in assessing the criminality reflected in its use to murder the deceased.  
14In a report from Dr Furst, a forensic psychiatrist, tendered in the sentence proceedings the offender maintained his denial of any involvement in the murder repeating that he ""was never there [at Tamworth] and that he had been stitched up big time"".  He will be sentenced on the basis of his complete lack of remorse or contrition.
15During the course of sentence proceedings Brodie Ryan, Jenny Ryan and Wendy Edwards, respectively the son and sisters of the deceased, read victim impact statements that were also formally tendered.  They described the deceased from their different experiences of him as a loved and irreplaceable family member.  It is beyond question that the circumstances in which he was killed has occasioned them the deepest grief.  Their determination to retain their memory of him as a supportive and generous father and brother is a measure of their strength and fortitude in the face of loss.  I extend my sympathies to them.
16The only evidence in the offender's case on sentence was Dr Furst's report.  From the information the offender provided to him, the following can be gleaned.  
17He is currently 47 years of age.  He was educated to Year 8 after which he worked in a sawmill and a poultry and dairy farm.  He has a work history as an interstate truck driver and at one time owned his own truck. 
18He was not working at the time of the offence.  He was involved in a truck accident at some unspecified time in the past from which he suffered multiple injuries, including head injuries, which caused memory loss and concentration problems.  The offender reported that he started using amphetamines around 1996 in order to get back to work as a driver, using 2 to 3g of the drug a day.  He reported that in the 12 months prior to his arrest he was abusing amphetamines, including crystal methamphetamine, using approximately 1g every 2 to 3 days at the time of his arrest.  Dr Furst considered this justified a diagnosis of amphetamine dependence.  He did not work for two years after the accident.  In 1994 he was exposed to the traumatic experience of a person who ran into him, apparently in an act of committing suicide, which Dr Furst considered justified a current diagnosis of a post-traumatic stress disorder.  
19The offender's de facto relationship of 26 years duration broke down in 2006 which caused him to suffer an emotional breakdown isolating himself from others and refusing offers of family support.  He has three adult children.  There is no evidence as to whether he has any continuing relationship with them.  He was involved in a de facto relationship of four years duration at the time of his arrest and at the time of his offending.  There is no evidence as to whether he has any continuing relationship with that woman.
20Dr Furst was of the view that the offender may have an underlying cognitive impairment and that his adjustment to the community in the future will require treatment and monitoring.  He went on to report that the offender is also likely to need ongoing specialist medical input within the prison system for his multiple medical problems, including his pain management needs.  
21Because the offender is to be sentenced for murder, I am obliged to consider the operation of s 19A and s 21 of the Crimes Act 1900 and, because the Crown has submitted that a life sentence should be imposed, s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 also needs to be considered.   
22Section 19A of the Crimes Act provides:(1) A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to imprisonment for life. (2) A person sentenced to imprisonment for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's natural life. (3) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 21 (1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life).
...
23Section 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides:If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term.
24The offence also attracts a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  Both statutory provisions need to be considered in the calculation of sentence having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender (Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120).
25Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides:A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.
26In Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; 164 A Crim R 126, this Court reviewed the operation of s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  McClellan CJ at CL said at [23]:Section 61(1) has been the subject of consideration in a number of decisions.  It is not necessary to analyse them for present purposes beyond a statement of the following principles:the maximum penalty for an offence in the case of murder, life imprisonment, is intended for cases falling within the worst category of case for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452.
it is not possible to prescribe a list of cases falling within the worst category - ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478; R v Petroff (unreported, 12 November 1991 - Hunt CJ at CL).
a life sentence is not reserved only for those cases where the offender is likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the rest of his or her life or for cases where there is no chance of rehabilitation; the maximum may be appropriate where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met by a sentence of life imprisonment; R v Kalazich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at (50-1); R v Baker (unreported, CCA 20 September 1995); R v Garforth (unreported CCA 23 May 1994).
in many cases a two stage approach to the consideration of whether the maximum penalty should be imposed is appropriate. Firstly, consideration is given to whether the objective gravity of the offence brings it within the worst class of case and then consideration is given to whether the subjective circumstances of the offender require a lesser sentence: R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466; R v Valera [2002] NSWCCA 50.
...
27In R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557, Wood CJ at CL (Tobias JA and Hidden J agreeing) held that the focus of s 61(1) is to assess whether the offender's culpability for murder is so extreme that the community's interest in any combination of retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence could only be met with the imposition of a life sentence (subject only to the discretion to which I have referred).  The absence of any one of the statutory criteria is not determinative although the conclusion that a life sentence is required may be more difficult where the evidence of future dangerousness is, for example, moderated by the age of the offender and the likely length of a determinate sentence, or the absence of any relevant criminal record. 
28The Crown submitted that it had discharged the burden of establishing to the criminal standard that this offender's culpability meets the statutory criteria in s 61 (see R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270).  He submitted that a person who kills under contract is in the worst category of cases of murder and that this killing of a defenceless man who was a stranger to the offender, coupled with there being nothing in this offender's subjective circumstances to justify a lesser sentence, warranted the imposition of a life sentence. 
29While premeditation alone, even coupled with financial motives for a killing, does not necessarily place a case in the worst category (see R v Willard [2005] NSWSC 402), contract killings are frequently referred to in the authorities as prima facie in the worst category and have been found to fall in the worst category of case attracting a life sentence (see the cases cited in R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448 at [60]), although as Hunt CJ at CL in R v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 recognised at [52], there may be contract killings which do not attract the maximum penalty.  What is critical when a life sentence is under consideration is for the sentencing court to identify the particular features of the individual case which are relied upon by the Crown as justifying its description as an offence of very great heinousness, together with an absence of any facts mitigating the objective seriousness of the offending (as distinct from subjective circumstances mitigating the penalty to be imposed) such that the level of culpability is so extreme that it is properly one for which a life sentence is the only appropriate sentence (see R v Twala, NSWCCA, 4 November 1994, unreported).
30I am unable to identify any facts which operate to mitigate the objective seriousness of the offending for which this offender is solely responsible.  Accepting a contract to kill, and then executing that agreement coldly and callously, cannot be described otherwise than offending of a very high order.  Ms Davenport SC did not seek to persuade me to the contrary.  She did not submit that the offender's psychiatric history has any causal connection with the commission of the offence such as might operate to mitigate in some way the seriousness of the offending or that his drug and alcohol history has any material bearing on the sentence to be imposed.
31So far as the operation of s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is concerned, the question that remains is whether the offending is of such an extreme kind that a life sentence is the only appropriate sentence.  Ms Davenport submitted that there is nothing in the offender's criminal record which illuminates his moral culpability for this offence and nothing other than this offence to suggest that he has any dangerous propensity.  I accept that submission.  The offender's record of prior offending as an adult is almost exclusively concerned with driving offences of one kind or another save for one offence in April 2008 where he was fined for possessing a prohibited weapon without a permit.  
32In his report, Dr Furst also spoke of a risk the offender poses to himself and others which also requires monitoring without elaborating in any way upon the nature or extent of the risk to others.  The Crown did not require him to attend for cross-examination.  No submissions were directed to that aspect of his report.  I do not consider it informs the question of future dangerousness for the purposes of the operation of s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  In these circumstances, and despite his committed actions in agreeing to kill the deceased and fulfilling that agreement, I am unable to make a finding adverse to the offender on the question of future dangerousness.  
33Ms Davenport also invited me to find that the offender is not entirely without rehabilitative prospects if his current psychiatric condition and other complicating personality problems are able to be addressed in the prison system.  I am not able to form any view as to his prospects of rehabilitation in circumstances where he remains resistant to acknowledging his role in the offence, an involvement which, as I have noted, is amply demonstrated by the evidence led against him at his trial.
34The sentence to be imposed in this case must also take into account the fact that sentences have been imposed on three co-offenders, with Helen Ryan's criminality as the woman who contracted him to kill her husband being most closely allied to the criminality of this offender.  Latham J was invited to impose a life sentence on Helen Ryan but refrained from doing so.  Despite finding that her cold-blooded scheme to have her husband murdered reflected criminality of a very high order, replete as it was with callousness, determination and the most base self interest including financial gain, her Honour was not of the view that the offending was within the worst category.  Even were she of that view her Honour was not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the imposition of a life sentence was required to meet the combined effect of retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence. 
35In all the circumstances, despite the findings I have made as to the high degree of criminality involved in the offence of murder for which the offender stands to be sentenced, I am not satisfied that the offending is within the worst case category (although it is very close to it), where the extent of planning appears minimal and where there is no suggestion of any sophistication or of any particular ingenuity of any kind in this offender carrying out the plan he made with Helen Ryan that the deceased would be killed by being shot.  I am also of the considered view that the sentencing objectives of retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can be satisfied in this offender's case by the imposition of a very lengthy sentence.  
36I am reinforced in the view after application of the principles of parity.  Save for this offender being the shooter, Helen Ryan's criminality is not readily distinguishable from his.  I am not, however, satisfied that parity dictates that he receive the same sentence as that imposed upon Helen Ryan.  Some difference in treatment is justified due to this offender's role as the contracted killer.  However, were I to impose a life sentence, which by definition carries no prospect of release, I am satisfied it would result in a sentence out of appropriate proportion to differentiate between them.  I do not regard their subjective circumstances as materially different for sentencing purposes.  
37It is not suggested that there is any basis for a finding of special circumstances in the sentence to be imposed on this offender and I find none. 
Sentence
38Kenneth Harold Brooks you are sentenced to imprisonment for 38 years comprised of a non-parole period of 28 years and 6 months to date from 10 February 2010 and expiring on 9 August 2038, with a balance of term of 9 years and 6 months expiring on 9 February 2048.

2759270,R v Pratten (No 6) [2012] NSWSC 1669,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: These proceedings concern charges of obtaining a financial benefit by deception and the criminal guilt of the accused. The prosecution, for the purpose of proving that guilt, seeks to tender a summary of the tax payable in the opinion of the Australian Taxation Office if the tax returns were to have reflected what the Taxation Office says they should have. Objection is taken to the summary. I do not deal with the issues arising understand s 50 of theEvidence Act 1995, that is the need for a summary as distinct from source documents. That is not the basis of the objection.
	
	
	The objection is based upon relevance and the provisions of s 137, namely, that the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused outweighs the probative value of the evidence adduced.
	
	
	Earlier in these proceedings I indicated a preliminary view in relation to the relevance of default assessments as a fact, namely, that the Australian Taxation Office has taken the view that greater income tax is owed than that which was paid and calculated as a result of the income tax return that was lodged in each of the relevant years.
	
	
	On the face of it, the amount of income tax that would be payable in the view of the Australian Taxation Office is a matter that could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings, namely, that tax was payable. That statement is consistent with the earlier rulings made by me, namely, that the fact that there has been a default assessment, in which the tax office no longer accepts the veracity of the income tax returns lodged by or on behalf of Mr Pratten, must be relevant to whether or not there has been the obtaining of a financial advantage.
	
	
	It is not suggested that the summary would be admissible under the exception to the provisions that prevent or preclude the admission of opinion evidence. I harken back to a statement earlier made as to the structure of the Evidence Act. By earlier, I mean earlier in these proceedings, rather than earlier in these reasons for judgment.
	
	
	Essentially, the Evidence Act is predicated on the proposition that all relevant evidence is admissible. To that general proposition, there are a number of exceptions and from those exceptions there are exemptions rendering admissible material or evidence that would otherwise be excepted.
	
	
	One of the exceptions to the provisions as to relevant evidence is the exception as to opinion. One of the exemptions which allows the admission of opinion evidence is that contained in s 79, namely, that the opinion evidence is based upon a specialised knowledge based upon a person's training, study or experience.
	
	
	I make this comment simply because the parties have not addressed the issue, but it seems to me to underpin the parties' attitude that the current witness, Mr Barns, is a person with specialised knowledge, and the material that has been summarised is material that is based upon that specialised knowledge, being training, study or experience of Mr Barns.
	
	
	The fundamental issue, it seems to me, is that which is contained in the provisions of s 137 and, to a lesser degree, s 135 of the Evidence Act. Section 137 applies in criminal proceedings and requires a court to refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value were outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	There are a number of fundamental aspects of that section or provision. Firstly, it requires the Court to refuse to admit the evidence if the condition is satisfied. Secondly, the weighing must be on the one hand of probative value and, on the other, of the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	In that latter aspect there are sub-issues that need refinement or adumbration. The first is that we are looking at the danger, not the reality, of unfair prejudice. The second is that it is unfair prejudice, with the emphasis on the word ""unfair"", in that a prejudice to the case of the accused is not an unfair prejudice in proceedings. Lastly, the danger of unfair prejudice must take account of the proceedings as a whole, and the directions that will be given by the trial judge as to the use that may be made of material.
	
	
	Section 135 confers a discretion on a court to refuse to admit evidence, certainly if there were a danger that it is unfairly prejudicial, or a danger that it might be misleading or confusing or cause or result in a waste of time. I do not deal with the issue contained in s 135(c) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	It seems to me that if s 137 were satisfied, there is no work for s 135(a) to do. I have in other proceedings and another context suggested that misleading or confusing evidence is probably unfairly prejudicial in any event. But to the extent that the term, as being more confusing, adds to the unfair prejudice, it seems to me s 135(b) has work to do beyond that contained in s 137.
	
	
	I have earlier indicated a view that the fact that money is said to be owed by the Australian Taxation Office is a fact relevant and not prejudicial. The converse would be bizarre. That is, the proposition that a person could be prosecuted for the obtaining of a financial advantage by deception in relation to a tax fraud case in circumstances where the tax department says the person owed no money would be a bizarre proposition, and obviously the Crown should be in a position to show that the tax department says money is owed in relation to each of the years for which a charge has been preferred.
	
	
	However, the calculation of the amount owing depends upon questions fundamentally different from those to which the jury must pay attention. The jury must take into account the ordinary meaning of the term ""income"", and a common sense view as to whether the income as alleged to have been earned by Mr Pratten was in fact earned by him, as distinct from one or other entities.
	
	
	Of course the jury must be directed on the proper interpretation of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, as relevant to transactions between Mr Pratten and controlled entities. By that I mean entities over which he in fact exercises control. Whatever be the effect of the Income Tax Assessment Act, that is a matter in relation to which the Court, constituted by me, will direct the jury.
	
	
	A default assessment may take into account a range of other factors, for example, the voiding of transactions under the administrative powers that are reposed in the Tax Commissioner. Therefore, a default assessment may not necessarily reflect that which would be owed, taking into account the issues that the jury must take into account, in determining the charges with which they must deal.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it seems to me that the tender of this exhibit is unfairly prejudicial, and any probative value that it may have and has been overcome by evidence that has already been adduced as to what, in fact, should have been the subject of declaration. On that basis, the unfair prejudice outweighs its probative value, and I decline to admit the evidence in accordance with the requirements of s 137 of the Evidence Act.

		29 April 2016",2012-05-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759281,Aouli v R [2012] NSWCCA 104,"Judgment

1ALLSOP P: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentence imposed by a judge of this Court for offences of affray under s 93C of the Crimes Act 1900 and manslaughter under s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900.

2The submissions were directed principally to the question of the objective seriousness of the acts in relation to the affray and the approach of the sentencing judge in relation to those matters, in particular how the applicant's culpability should be viewed by reference to two of his co-offenders.

3The applicant was a member of the Comancheros motorcycle gang, who engaged in a brawl with members of the Hells Angels at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009. A member of the Hells Angels, Mr Anthony Zervas, was killed on that day, being stabbed and beaten to death with a metal bollard. The applicant did not inflict any of the violence.

4Sentences were imposed on the applicant as follows: s 93C, two years and five months imprisonment to commence 27 March 2009, being the date of the first incarceration; and for manslaughter, non-parole period of three years with a balance of term of two years and eight months to commence from 27 September 2009. These two sentences saw but six months accumulation for the affray.

5The application is essentially, as I said, one of parity by reference to the sentences imposed on the applicant for the affray and the accumulation. The co-offenders, Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa, were sentenced to respectively as follows: Mr Pirini, two years and two months for the affray and three years non-parole plus three years balance of term for the manslaughter; and Mr La Rosa, two years and four months for the affray and three years and three months non-parole, three years and four months balance of term for the manslaughter. Different discounts for the pleas were given by the sentencing judge.

6In my opinion, there are no reasonable prospects of success in the appeal. The small differences between the three offences were explained carefully by the sentencing judge at paras [38] to [40], and in particular [84] and following of his Reasons for Judgement. It is undoubted that the terms of s 93C in relation to the offence required in terms that the conduct of the two or more persons taken together must be considered as the purposes of sub-s (1). His Honour said the following:

""[38]  In the light of submissions that were made on the offender's behalf by Ms Francis of counsel, it is important to also recognise that the agreed facts are that the offender threatened unlawful violence 'along with his fellow Comanchero members'. In the light of this, an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence cannot be made solely upon an examination of the actual role played by the offender. The 'conduct of them taken together ... must be considered': s 93C(2). 

[39]  I acknowledge that the affray was relatively short-lived and that the offender's role was less than that of other participants. He did not engage in any of the physical violence. These features were at the heart of the submission by Ms Francis that if this was the only offence for which he was to be dealt with, it would not attract a full-time custodial sentence. 

[40]  I do not accept that submission. The offence involved the offender engaging in conduct with nine of his Comanchero associates that struck fear in a significant number of members of the public in a place where they were entitled to feel safe and secure. It was an agreed fact that there were a large number of persons in the vicinity and that they included children and elderly people. It cannot be ignored, as well, that the offender played a role in having further Comanchero members attend the airport, adding numbers to the five who were on the flight. The matter is of quite some seriousness.""

7He went on to say the following, at para [83] and following:

""[83]  I do not intend to isolate each and every one of the similarities and differences between the present case and those concerning Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa. Three matters do, however, stand out. 

[84]  The first is that the offender was involved in the activity that brought about the attendance at the airport of greater numbers of Comancheros. He was directed by Mr Hawi to 'call other Comanchero to attend' the airport. He called Mr Abounader before the flight took off in Melbourne. By way of contrast, Mr Pirini was not involved in summoning reinforcements. He was generally aware of the hostility directed towards Mr Wainohu, but seems to have been somewhat ambivalent about it, did not participate in it, and slept for most of the flight. 

[85]  The second matter is that in the affray, unlike Mr Pirini, but like Mr La Rosa, the offender was part of the moving group of Comanchero participants but was not otherwise responsible for any physical act of violence. This is not a point of very great distinction. The seriousness of the offence also lies in a number of other factors which I have discussed earlier and, although Mr Pirini was physically involved, it was to a relatively minor extent ('scuffles'). 

[86]  The third matter is more significant. In respect of the manslaughter, Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa were parties to a joint enterprise to physically assault Hells Angels members. Mr Pirini was directly involved in a fight with one Hells Angels member, albeit in a defensive way and he did not land a blow. He was otherwise willing to assist as required. Mr La Rosa did not physically participate at all, but he, too, was willing to assist as required. The agreed facts in respect of the present offender, on the other hand, are that he was a participant in a joint enterprise to assault by way of intimidation, not physically, and he was not willing to assist in any physical assault. 

[87]  I do not regard the seriousness of the affray insofar as it concerns the offender as being appreciably different from the assessment I made with respect to Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa. I do, however, find that the seriousness of the manslaughter offence for him is less than it was in respect of those two. The Crown accepted that this was so. ""

8Those reasons reflect a clear, precise and careful consideration of the circumstances of the offence and of the offenders.

9Elsewhere in the reasons the learned sentencing judge dealt with other objective and subjective factors bearing on the criminality of what occurred. I should add that at [47] and [48] the learned sentencing judge said the following:

""[47]  It is appropriate that I reiterate some other things I said in the course of sentencing Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa. Members of the community have an entitlement to feel safe and secure in public places. The selfish and mindless arrogance of those who perpetrate extreme levels of violence for their own ends with complete disregard for others warrants the strongest condemnation. This includes those who are prepared to associate themselves with such violence, even though not directly participating.

[48]  It is necessary in the assessment of sentence to denounce the offender's conduct. It must be made clear to him, and others who may contemplate acting in such a way, that such conduct will be met with condign punishment. Aggressive and violent conduct between rival gang members in public places will not be tolerated, the more so where there is an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury. That risk, in what occurred in this case in the departure hall, was high indeed. The offender must be punished and made accountable for his part in this tragic affair.""

10It was submitted that there was an error in sentencing principle by using what was referred to as common purpose principles. In my view no error of any kind has been displayed. The learned sentencing judge dealt with the objective circumstances of the fear that could have been and was engendered by the conduct. It was accepted in the plea that the plea did not go to intention. I do not see how sentencing principles for s 93C would require the learned sentencing judge to do other than examine the facts of the affray with the care he did and reach an evaluative conclusion as to the respective culpability, which he did.

11No submissions were put in relation to the sentence individually for the manslaughter. It really is a question of accumulation of the two sentences bearing in mind what is said to be the misapprehension of the participation of the applicant in the first.

12Whilst the applicant did not actually inflict any actual violence and his plea should be taken in the limited way that it was intended, there was undoubtedly the likelihood and fact of significant fear being engendered in members of the public and the matters to which his Honour referred at [47] and [48] are indeed apposite. 

13If there were any doubt about there being any error about the way his Honour approached it, in the light of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 no lesser sentence is warranted. In my view, the sentences imposed by his Honour individually and as accumulated were reasoned, careful and moderate. I would dismiss the application for leave to appeal.

14DAVIES J: I agree.

15SCHMIDT J: I agree.

16ALLSOP P: The order of the Court is: application for leave to appeal dismissed.

2759284,R v Purtill [2012] NSWSC 566,"remarks on sentence

1HIS HONOUR: On 2 February 2011 the offender Warren Malcolm Purtill pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one count of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of John Garda, contrary to s 18 and s 349 of the Crimes Act 1900. Upon the basis of the agreed facts and other evidence not the subject of contest, including a statement from the offender, the following facts are accepted for sentencing purposes.

Agreed facts

2The deceased was a well-known businessman who owned and operated a convenience store and a newsagency in Byron Bay. On 10 February 2010 the police received a report that the deceased was missing. He had been last seen by a real estate agent in Byron Bay whom he visited early on the afternoon of 8 February 2010. His body was subsequently located in a shallow grave on 26 February 2010 near Broadwater on the north coast of New South Wales. 

3After visiting the real estate agent the deceased went to the home of the offender's brother Kevin Purtill in Blue Seas Parade, Lennox Head. During that afternoon the deceased was killed by Kevin Purtill at his home using a knife to inflict a fatal wound to the deceased's neck and throat. Kevin Purtill has been charged with the murder of the deceased.

4Lily Richardson lived in a granny flat beneath Kevin Purtill's home. On that afternoon she came home at about 2.15pm and began to watch DVDs. The offender arrived at her home at about 3.30pm and joined her. Shortly after that the sound of raised voices could be heard coming from Kevin Purtill's home above. Ms Richardson heard Kevin Purtill yelling, ""You fucking cunt"" a few times followed by a loud thud. It sounded as if something had hit the floor. She heard a similar sound on a few more occasions followed by the sound of someone crying out in pain.

5The offender immediately ran upstairs and knocked on the front door of Kevin Purtill's home. He called out, ""Open up, it's me Wozza"". There was no answer. The noises had ceased. The offender then went back to the door and knocked again. Kevin Purtill called out, ""Are you alone?"" and the offender replied, ""Yes"". Kevin Purtill then opened the door and allowed the offender to enter.

6The offender noticed a deep laceration on Kevin Purtill's arm and a large amount of blood in the living room and kitchen. The offender saw the deceased lying on the kitchen floor against the kitchen bench. He could see that he had a cut to his neck and he believed that he was dead. The offender went back downstairs and told Ms Richardson to keep all the doors and windows locked and to stay inside. He went back upstairs. A short time later, blood began dripping through the ceiling of her flat. She rang a friend and asked to be picked up. Later that night she sent a text message to the offender about the blood and he replied, telling her that he would help her clean it up.

7The offender and Kevin Purtill talked over the next few hours. The deceased's car was parked nearby. The offender took the deceased's car keys from his shorts and drove his car to South Ballina where he parked it beside a hotel. The offender also took a number of the deceased's credit cards from inside the vehicle. He caught a taxi to Kevin Purtill's home, stopping on the way to collect his canvas swag. Upon his return the offender and Kevin Purtill placed the deceased inside the canvas swag and loaded it into the rear of the offender's utility. The offender then drove the body to a remote location approximately three kilometres south of Broadwater. Kevin Purtill travelled in the vehicle with the offender and directed him where to go. The offender dug a shallow grave and placed the wrapped body of the deceased in the grave and covered it with sandy soil.

8Kevin Purtill and the offender returned to Kevin's home in the early hours of 9 February 2010. Kevin Purtill left for Brisbane later that day to stay with his family. The offender stayed at the premises for several days and cleaned it. He used chemicals and water to clean up blood and broken household items. He purchased a new toilet to replace the one that had been broken when the deceased had been killed. He installed the new toilet and disposed of the old one.

9On 10 February 2010 the offender returned to the deceased's vehicle and drove it to another location in South Ballina. He left it there with the keys in the ignition. On 12 February 2010 he returned to the car and drove it to the Pacific Fair shopping centre in Broadbeach, Queensland, where he left it in the car park. In the days that followed the offender made a series of purchases using the deceased's credit cards. Suspicions were raised concerning these transactions and the police were contacted. 

10On 16 February 2010 the offender was arrested and charged with fraud and larceny offences arising from the taking and use of the credit cards. He was interviewed and told police that he had found the cards in a rubbish bin in Lennox Head. He denied knowing the deceased. He was refused bail. On 17 February 2010 police executed a search warrant at Kevin Purtill's home. Some of the items purchased by the offender using the deceased's credit cards were located there. The offender's utility was examined the following day and returned a positive test for the presence of blood.

11On 19 February 2010 the offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court to larceny and seven counts of obtaining a benefit by deception. He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment commencing on 16 February 2010.

12On 26 February 2010 Kevin Purtill attended Lismore Police station and handed investigators a map depicting the location of the body of the deceased. He declined to participate in an interview with the police. The deceased's body was located at the place indicated on the map. The deceased was dressed in underpants and shorts and socks but was not wearing a shirt. A surgical glove was on his right hand. An autopsy revealed that a wound to the neck caused the death of the deceased. The wound was relatively superficial at the front and much deeper on the right side and back. The wound was consistent with having been inflicted by a knife using moderate force. There was also a wound on the cheek but there were no injuries consistent with a struggle having occurred. There were no defensive wounds on the deceased. Death occurred on or around 8 February 2010.

13A later search of Kevin Purtill's home located blood with the deceased's DNA profile. On 2 March 2010 the offender was interviewed by the police and made full and frank admissions to having been an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased. He was charged and remanded in custody.

The record of interview 

14The offender participated in a very lengthy electronically recorded interview on 2 March 2010. Its contents are not the subject of controversy before me. There is no inconsistency between the material contained in the interview and the agreed facts. The offender professed to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He said that he had never been involved in anything like this before. He said he told his brother at the time, ""I really wish I hadn't...knocked on your door and you shouldn't have opened the door"". The offender said his brother said, ""It's too late. I've fucked up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry"". The offender said that after that he ""just started cleaning up in the bathroom"". He said, ""It was like I was on auto pilot"".

15At one point in the interview, the following exchange appears:

""Q401 Yeah. All right.

A I just didn't want him going to prison. That's why I covered it up and done all that sort of stuff. If he hadn't have had the baby I probably would have turned around and walked straight back out the door and just said, your shit, you deal with it.""

16Later in the same interview, these questions and answers are recorded:

""Q780 ...In your mind, what was your reason for burying Jack's body and getting rid of the car and...

A 'Cause I didn't want my little brother to get caught for anything.

Q781 OK. And by that you mean caught by the police?

A You got it. Like I said, he just had a new baby, do you know what I mean, getting the house looking nice, everything was going well for him...

Q782 Yeah.

A...and then that shit happens and me being his big brother, and like I said to him, I said, 'If it, if it turns bad,' I said, 'Just put it on me'.""

17The record of interview also deals with notes written by the offender in apparent anticipation of taking his own life. The notes are prayed in aid of his position in these sentencing proceedings and are referred to in more detail below.

Subjective factors

18The offender was born in November 1963 and is presently 48 years of age. He told Dr Nielssen that at the time of the commission of the offence he had been without anywhere to live and had been sleeping in his car. He was using his brother's address to receive mail. He told Dr Nielssen that he had in fact met the deceased several times at his brother's house, but did not know him well and had not formed any particular impression about him. He said that he did not know of any grievance that may have existed between his brother and the deceased, although he understood that they had discussed opening a restaurant in Lennox Head together.

19The offender confirmed with Dr Nielssen that he had helped his brother dispose of the deceased's body and that he had tried to protect his brother by using the deceased's credit cards in order to leave the impression that he was still alive. He said that he had also tried to protect his brother by saying that he had found the deceased's bag.

20The offender told Dr Nielssen that the offence occurred at a low point in his life. He had not long before been laid off from his job at a camper van company during the depths of the global financial crisis, and had been unable to afford the rent on his apartment. He said that he had run out of money and was living on social security benefits and petrol vouchers from an employment agency that was helping him to obtain work. He said that he was ""pretty depressed"" at the time but was not receiving any treatment. He told Dr Nielssen that he had contemplated suicide several times.

21The offender was not using drugs but his alcohol consumption had increased in the period after he lost his job. His intake was however limited by his poor financial position. He told Dr Nielssen that the decision to dispose of the body, instead of calling the police, was made in part because of the delay brought about by the shock of the experience and consideration of how he might be perceived, given that he had a criminal record in Queensland. His brother had allegedly informed him that the deceased ""hangs around with heavy hitters"" and the offender said that he was more concerned about such people than the police.

22The offender reported that he considered that he was close to his brother and had moved from Melbourne to Lennox Head in order to spend more time with him. However, he said that his brother was not very supportive when he lost his job and his brother had not expressed any gratitude towards him for the assistance he gave in attempting to shield him from trouble since his arrest.

23The offender's father had been an alcoholic who also suffered from depression and the abuse of sedative medication. He and his siblings were affected by his father's abuse when depressed or intoxicated.

24His early intellectual development was normal and he did not have any contact with mental health services or child protection agencies during his upbringing. His first contact with a mental health service occurred following his attempted suicide by stabbing himself in the heart at the age of 30. He saw a counsellor for a while but mainly helped himself. He has been prescribed anti-depressant medication by general practitioners from time to time. He attempted suicide by taking an overdose of an anti-depressant medication and was advised to stop taking it. The offender has never experienced hallucinations of voices or other typical forms of schizophrenia at any time.

25The offender has suffered several blows to the head at the hands of his father, including loss of consciousness. He has sustained broken cheekbones on both sides in such assaults and his nose has also been broken on several occasions. Physical abuse by his father has led to him being hospitalised on several occasions for treatment. Social or community agencies were never involved as a consequence of any of these incidents.

26The offender reported epileptic seizures for a period of about three years from the age of seventeen. He took medication and these episodes did not continue after he reached his twenties. He is currently taking an anti-depressant medication prescribed for him since he has been in gaol.

27The offender said that he rarely drank alcohol and had never been a heavy drinker, influenced in this respect by the effect of alcohol upon his father. He used cannabis from his mid-twenties but never heavily. He suffered no complications from this such as psychosis or impaired mental function. He denied ever abusing medication of any sort. He has smoked cigarettes all of his adult life apart from a short period of three months when in custody. He has gained thirteen kilograms since his arrest.

28The offender is the eldest of three children. His brother is in custody and his sister lives in Brisbane. He grew up in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. His father was a butcher by trade and had been in charge of freezers in a big nursing home in the city before his retirement on ""psychological grounds"". He is now terminally ill and partially paralysed. The offender has not spoken to his father for ten years. He tried to protect his brother from his father when he was younger.

29The offender did well at school and completed year 10 with a good pass. He worked as a porter in a big hotel after leaving school. He has worked as a barman, a boilermaker, a farm hand, on tuna boats and he has run hotels. He never married but has two adult children from a relationship that lasted seven years. He has two grandchildren. He does not communicate with his former partner. He was in another relationship for nine years but left that relationship shortly before moving to the Byron Bay area.

30The offender served a three-year sentence in Queensland for sexual assault, which he said was associated with a period of heavy drinking. He believes his drink was spiked. He was also charged with another drink related offence as a younger man.

31Dr Nielssen diagnosed the offender to be suffering from alcohol abuse disorder and chronic low-grade depressive illness. He was not considered to be in need of intensive counselling for substance abuse disorder as it was at the less severe end of the spectrum. The offender has been a compliant inmate with impressive work records. He is confronted with difficulties in his relationship with his family because of the circumstances of this case.

Objective seriousness

32In R v Urriola [2010] NSWSC 367 at [28] - [30] Fullerton J explained the importance of the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence in a similar context:

""[28] It is critical to the sentence to be imposed on the first count that a careful assessment be made of the objective seriousness of the offending since it is well recognised that there is a wide variation in the degrees of moral culpability of persons convicted of the offence of accessory after the fact to murder. In some cases, the moral culpability is moderated where the offender's conduct can be said to be a spontaneous reaction to a critical or unexpected situation (as for example in the case of R v Quach [2002] NSWSC 1205), even though the assistance in that case involved the disposal of a body after a murder, is conduct which the authorities recognise as within the upper echelons of offending comprehended by the offence (see the review of those authorities in R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944). The disposal of a body is also consistently regarded in the authorities as of greater seriousness than assisting a murderer to clean up a crime scene, or assisting by disposing of a weapon or other incriminating evidence associated with the murder. 

[29] In the present case the offender's conduct involves both disposing of the body of the deceased and the destruction of his car in circumstance where it could not be said that he was caught by surprise much less that he acted spontaneously. To the contrary. The manner in which the deceased's body was to be disposed of was planned and organised by Christiansen in advance of the murder, his purchase of the toolbox being ample evidence of that fact. While I accept that the offender was not made aware of Christiansen's plans to murder the deceased, and that he did not know the deceased or have any involvement in the drug debt that motivated the murder, when he was made aware that the deceased had been killed he voluntarily, indeed willingly agreed to provide assistance in disposing of the body and signalled his approval of the killing and that it had been paid for in drugs. I am in no doubt that despite the fact that the offender was apparently in Christiansen's thrall (and had been for some time as he progressively withdrew from family life into a daily routine coloured by habitual drug use, self enhancement and the lifestyle it spawns) he had more than sufficient time over the intervening evening on 6 December 2008 to reflect upon his conduct and its consequences and to withdraw from what had become by that time an entrenched criminal association with Christiansen. The fact that as at December 2008 the offender had by his own admission become personally involved in Christiansen's criminal activity as a drug supplier over a period of 12 months, despite the fact that his involvement fell short of participating as a co-offender in the murder, the seriousness of his offending as an accessory after the fact to murder is aggravated by his criminal association with Christiansen (see R v Do, Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 May 1997, unreported). 

[30] In the result, I regard the offending constituted by the first count as offending of a most serious kind. It is not, however, offending in a worst case category and the Crown does not contend otherwise. That said, the offender's youth, the absence of any criminal record coupled with a degree of psychological vulnerability motivating his misplaced loyalty and reverence for Christiansen, operate in combination to mitigate to some extent the objective seriousness in the offending comprehended by the first count.""

33The recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Urriola v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 95 allowing in part an appeal from the sentence imposed by Fullerton J in that case does not derogate from the significance of her Honour's remarks as quoted for present purposes.

34In the present case the assistance given by the offender to his brother was not inconsiderable. He appears to have taken command of the situation that confronted him when he was allowed into his brother's house and proceeded thereafter to initiate and implement a plan to ensure that his brother's crime was not detected. This included the cleaning of the house in a thorough fashion over several days and the replacement of the toilet that was damaged when the deceased was killed. The offender systematically took his brother's car to a location that was both unlikely to throw suspicion upon his brother and likely to increase the possibility that the car might be stolen so as to consolidate his alibi. The car was later moved and then moved again.

35The offender arranged for a canvas bag to be picked up on his way back to the scene within which to transport the body of the deceased. He put the body in the bag, loaded it into his own vehicle and drove it to a remote location where he buried it in a shallow grave that he prepared by himself. He did not disclose what he knew of the events in his brother's house to Ms Richardson. He used the deceased's credit cards to purchase items in order to give the impression that the deceased was still alive even after he had been reported missing. 

36I accept that none of the offender's actions was planned before the death of the deceased. His involvement in assisting his brother did not commence until he was confronted with the death as he entered his brother's house. The offender was presented with these events suddenly and unexpectedly. It is not suggested that he had, or could have had, any forewarning or prior notice of what occurred. His actions were therefore, to that extent at least, spontaneous and unplanned. They did however acquire a different character in the hours and days that followed. Indeed, the offender systematically utilised the privacy of his brother's then unoccupied house to eradicate any signs or traces of the murder and to engage in a strategy beyond the premises to frustrate any efforts to locate the deceased that the police or others may by then have been taking.

37The offender is older than his brother. It is clear that his actions were not taken under the influence of undue pressure or some other form of coercion brought to bear upon him by his brother because of the difference in their respective ages or for any other reason. Indeed, the reverse would appear to apply inasmuch as the offender had always been someone who looked out for and took care of his younger brother. His actions are claimed by the offender to be the result of an altruistic if misguided sense of kinship and loyalty to a younger man with a young family. The minor extent to which that fact might mitigate the seriousness of the offence has to be contrasted with the fairly extended period over and during which he committed it with the continuing opportunity to withdraw from his relatively involved plans and actions.

38Wood CJ at CL reviewed the authorities as they then stood in R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944 on the issue of objective seriousness at [32] - [41] as follows:

""[32] The maximum penalty for the offence of accessory after the act of murder is imprisonment for 25 years. As the Judicial Commission statistics reveal, the sentencing pattern for that offence accommodates a very broad span of custodial and non-custodial outcomes. Those offenders sentenced to full-time custody represent forty-four per cent of the cases surveyed. Within that group of offenders, fifty-one per cent were sentenced to full terms of up to twenty-four months and thirty-three per cent were sentenced to full terms of between five and eight years. 

[33] Considerable caution needs to be exercised in placing too much reliance upon these statistics. The population surveyed is relatively small and the collection of raw figures risks masking the wide range of objective and subjective circumstances encountered. The range suggested does, however, support the observation of Gleeson CJ in R v Farroukh NSWCCA 29 March 1996, to the following effect: 

'The maximum penalty is penal servitude for twenty-five years. There is, however, a wide variation in the possible degrees of moral culpability of persons convicted of this offence. The present was not a case, as sometimes occurs, where an accessory after the fact has been personally involved in a criminal enterprise, although the involvement falls short of participation as a principal, or where an accessory is associated with criminal elements and has become an accessory by reason of that association (cf R v Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 32, R v Winston (1994) 74 A Crim R 312.)'

[34] That was a case where the offenders, who were convicted after trial, assisted the principal offender, a close relative, by helping him to clean the victim's blood from himself and his car, by providing him with clean clothes and by helping him remove his vehicle. Upon a Crown appeal, the sentences were increased to provide for a minimum term of eighteen months and an additional term of six months. 

[35] The observations of Gleeson CJ were repeated in Tan Do NSWCCA 7 May 1997 in which a Crown appeal against sentences of concurrent fixed terms of twelve months and six months to be served by way of periodic detention, were dismissed. That was a case where the respondent had provided temporary accommodation to a person who had committed a murder in the course of an armed robbery, had agreed to hold a portion of the proceeds of the robbery for the principal offender in case they were needed for his legal defence and had agreed, although without any intention of carrying the promise through, to provide a false alibi for him. 

[36] Cases bearing greater similarity to the present were reviewed in Winston (1994) 74 A Crim R 312 at 317. They include Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 32 where a head sentence of eight years, after taking into account a period of eight months on remand, was imposed upon an offender who had helped remove the body of a deceased from the house where he had been murdered, to the boot of a car, had hosed down the driveway afterwards, had wrapped up the murder weapon and placed it in the car and had cautioned another person to remain silent about anything she had seen or heard. 

[37] In Greig Queensland Supreme Court 13 August 1991 a sentence of five years was imposed in a case where the assistance involved digging a grave to bury the victim, an act which was viewed by the sentencing judge as a ""typical reaction of finding one's friend in a position of difficulty"". 

[38] In Crowley and Garner (1991) 55 A Crim R 201 a sentence of nine and a half years was discounted to five and a half years for assistance given to police in a case where the accused had helped the principal offender to load a body into a car and to dump it in the bush. 

[39] As McPherson and Pincus JJ pointed out in Winston at 316, matters to be taken into account in weighing the offender's objective criminality, include his knowledge of the murder and the circumstances of its commission, the nature of the assistance provided, the reason why it was provided and the extent to which it helped the primary offender to escape or to delay detection, apprehension and punishment. 

[40] The reason why the offence is regarded as serious is obvious. As Thomas J observed in Hawken: 

'An important aspect of being accessory after the fact to any offence is that the offender stands between criminals and the law.'

[41] So far as the offence of being accessory after the fact to murder is concerned, his Honour appropriately noted at 38: 

""But there is something special in the offence of being an accessory after the fact of murder. Section 307 recognises this by providing a penalty of life imprisonment for such an offence. It is in the interests of the community that murderers should be completely isolated from support and deprived of assistance and that such crimes be not covered up. The severe penalty available against accessories after the fact is a way in which the community protects itself and it is an aspect of the law's general deterrence against homicide.""

39Having regard to these authorities it seems to me that the offence in this case falls somewhere in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. The offender did not stand personally to benefit materially from his actions and he did not do so. There was no anterior well-planned criminal enterprise of which the offender might have been aware or with which he had been involved. His actions were altruistic if misguided. He ultimately and quite promptly gave a full confession to the police. Nothing that he did had the effect of permanently frustrating or diminishing the strength of the Crown case against the principal offender, with the possible significant exception of the destruction of forensic and other evidence as a result of his cleaning activities at the scene of the death of the deceased.

Assistance to authorities and early plea

40It is submitted on behalf of the offender, and accepted by the Crown, that the offender is entitled to a combined discount for the effect of his early plea and his offer of assistance to authorities. The offender has agreed that he will give evidence for the Crown at his brother's trial for the murder of the deceased. That assistance is likely to be significant in light of the fact that there were no witnesses to the death of the deceased. Apart from the offender and his brother, no other person saw the crime scene in the state it was in immediately following the death. It is likely that the case against the offender's brother would have been wholly circumstantial without the evidence that the offender is able and prepared to give. I consider that a combined discount of 40 percent in the circumstances of this case is not inappropriate.

Aggravating factors

41There are no aggravating factors.

Mitigating factors

42The offender was vulnerable to the effects of depression at the time of his commission of the offence. Although there is some small doubt that attends the date when the suicide notes were written by the offender, I am prepared to find on the balance of probabilities that they were written before the commission of the offence. Although the offender did not obviously carry through with the implied suggestion that he would take his own life, the mood and tone of the letters is one of desperation and hopelessness. The offender was in the course of attempting to say goodbye to significant people in his life. The letters are eloquent and moving but no less distressing for that. The letters give the impression that the offender was highly emotionally vulnerable.

43There is also in my opinion little if any prospect of reoffending. The very nature of this crime is particularly idiosyncratic. It does not represent or form part of an existing chain or course of criminal conduct. It occurred spontaneously and reactively to circumstances that presented themselves to the offender without warning. The need for special deterrence is therefore low. The prospects for rehabilitation are in my view correspondingly high.

44The same cannot be said for general deterrence. To the extent that any sentence carries a wider message to the community about the significance of punishment and retribution in a case such as this, the sentence that I impose must take account of the seriousness with which the Court and the community treats any conduct calculated to prevent those who commit violent crimes, such as that concerned with the death of the deceased, from being brought to justice.

45The offender did not give evidence before me. It is in those circumstances both difficult and somewhat artificial to form a view or to make any meaningful assessment of the offender's remorse or contrition for his actions. Having said that, the offender has, as already noted, made a considerable practical contribution to the administration of justice by confessing to his crime, and he has promised to continue to assist. These matters are significantly consistent with remorse and contrition, even if otherwise not expressed. It is also important to remember that the crime for which the offender is being sentenced is not the murder of the deceased. However, the heartless and clinical disposal of the body of the deceased is something to which, or about which, some statement from the offender might reasonably have been expected if submissions on his behalf about his contrite and remorseful state are to be given credence.

Special circumstances

46It was urged upon me that I should find ""special circumstances"" for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This was said to be upon the basis of the offender's labile mental state and the need for counselling and treatment following his release. I do not think that this offender is either in need of, or is likely to benefit from, any ongoing supervision or assistance over a period that would not be accommodated by the ordinary statutory period that he will serve on parole. I do not find special circumstances.

Victim impact statement

47A victim impact statement from the sister of the deceased was read aloud by her to the Court. She spoke of her own reaction to the death, as well as that of the extended family. All of these people would appear to be labouring with the burden of grief in various and personal ways. The death of the deceased is undoubtedly a terrible and unending fact of life for them and the rest of the family. Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of his family and friends who remember him. I am, however, mindful of the principles referred to in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, and I must conform to them.

The proper sentence

48I was referred to considerable authority relating to like offences. These included, but were not limited to, R v Galea [2003] NSWSC 465, R v Almirol [2007] NSWSC 323, R v Urriola [2010] NSWSC 367, R v Ferrett (No 4) [2010] NSWSC 956 and R v Postlewaight [2010] NSWSC 1272. I have also considered R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345; (2002) 132 A Crim R 408; R v Jin [2011] NSWSC 169; R v Fennell [2011] NSWSC 489; and R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104. In the latter case, Buddin J helpfully summarised at [15] - [26] some of the principles that apply in a case of this sort. 

49It is trite to observe that there is no single correct sentence that should be imposed. 

Sentence

50The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 16 February 2010. He served a sentence of 6 months for the fraud and larceny offences arising out the use of the deceased's credit cards referred to earlier. That sentence expired on 15 August 2010. The offender has therefore remained in custody since the expiration of that term in circumstances entirely referable to the present offence.

51Mr Smith of counsel for the offender submitted that I should not wholly accumulate the sentence I am required to impose upon the offender in the particular circumstances of this case but that there should be a degree of concurrence of that sentence with the 6 months already served for the other offences. It was submitted in effect that whereas they were on one view separate and distinct acts of criminality they actually arose out of precisely the same set of circumstances, being the murder of the deceased and the offender's desire to avoid detection of his brother for that crime. It was suggested that if the offender had been sentenced for those offences at the same time as he is being sentenced for the present offence, some degree of concurrence would have applied. The Crown did not contest that proposition as a matter of principle but argued that the degree of concurrence should be no more than 2 months. The offender suggested 3 months.

52Warren Malcolm Purtill you are formally convicted of the crime of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of John Garda. You are sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 4 years commencing on 16 May 2010 and expiring on 15 May 2014, with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 16 May 2010 and expiring on 15 May 2013.

1BASTEN JA: I agree with the reasons given by Garling J.

2JOHNSON J: I agree with Garling J.

3GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales by his Honour Judge Neilson on 21 October 2011.

4At the conclusion of argument on the hearing of the application, the Court made the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

5These are my reasons for joining in with the orders made on that day.

Introduction
6The applicant, Mr Phillip Apthorpe, pleaded guilty before Neilson DCJ to one offence of affray, contrary to s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 

7In addition, he asked, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that two further charges, placed on a List of Additional Charges (Form 1), be taken into account. They were a charge of intentionally damaging property contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act and of larceny, contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act.

8The principal offence related to an incident which occurred on 7 May 2010, when the applicant together with four other men, being his brother Graham, Mr Ryan Sloane, Mr Scott Sunners and Mr Jayden Hunter, set upon Richard Drake and assaulted him. 

9Neilson DCJ also had these co-offenders, except Mr Hunter, before him for sentence on 21 October 2011, at the same time as the applicant. 

10The maximum penalty for the offence of affray is 10 years imprisonment. No standard non-parole period applies. 

11The sentencing Judge imposed a total sentence on the applicant of 3 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 7 May 2010, which was the date upon which the applicant was arrested and bail was refused. 

12He imposed the following sentence on the other co-offenders:

(a)Mr Graham Apthorpe: 3 yrs 4 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months;

(b)Mr Ryan Sloane: 2 years 9 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years;

(c)Mr Scott Sunners: 2 years 8 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months.

Facts
13A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge. A brief summary of these facts is set out below.

14The applicant, at the time of these events, was in a relationship with a woman named Hayley Brewin. There was a history of animosity between the applicant's family and Ms Brewin's family. 

15The victim, Mr Richard Drake, was a close friend of Hayley Brewin's brother, Stephen Brewin. 

16On 7 May 2010, Mr Stephen Brewin and his friend Hayden Perry, attended at the Campbelltown Local Court because of the need to appear there in relation to an incident which had involved members of the Brewin family. Supporters of Mr Brewin and Mr Perry were present.

17The applicant, and one of his co-offenders, Mr Ryan Sloane, also went to the Campbelltown Local Court to observe the outcome of the matters. At the Court there was some friction between members of the Apthorpe family and the supporters of Mr Brewin and Mr Perry. 

18The victim, Mr Drake, was not involved in attending at Court. He was at work for the whole of 7 May 2010. When work concluded, he drove to a house at Ambarvale to see a friend. Whilst at that property, Mr Perry's mother and another companion, who had been at Campbelltown Local Court in support of Mr Brewin and Mr Perry, arrived at the property and informed Mr Drake of the result of the day's court proceedings. 

19Whilst Mr Drake was talking to these two ladies, a group of males, being the applicant and his co-offenders, approached Mr Drake and the two women. Upon seeing their approach, the two women ran to their car and left the scene. 

20The group of males surrounded Mr Drake. Mr Graham Apthorpe, the applicant's brother, commenced punching him in the face - connecting four or five times. Mr Drake knocked Mr Apthorpe down in retaliation and ran to the apparent safety of the front porch of the house that he was visiting. A number of the attackers chased him and overpowered him and dragged him back into the front yard. There, all of the group, including the applicant, surrounded Mr Drake and began kicking and stomping on him. The assault continued for a sustained period, during which time the victim lay on the ground and tried to protect his head.

21At one point during the assault, whilst it was continuing, one of the assailants produce a hard object and hit the victim in the face with it, causing damage to his teeth. At another point, he was lifted up from the ground and held by the arms by some offenders, while others of the offenders took turns striking him. 

22The assault by all of the co-offenders continued and eventually the victim lost consciousness. Just prior to that happening, his keys were taken by the applicant. This constituted one of the two offences on the Form 1, List of Additional Charges. 

23The applicant and his brother Graham then proceeded to damage the victim's car, including smashing a number of windows and damaging a number of panels. This conduct constituted the other offence on the Form 1.

24At the conclusion of the assault, the offenders, including the applicant, fled in the vehicles in which they arrived. 

25The victim was hospitalised for about six days and required several weeks off work. He had a minimally displaced fracture of his right nasal bone, damage to his teeth, extensive bruising to his head, face, chest and shoulders and a ruptured blood vessel within his right eye. 

26The applicant was arrested within a few minutes of the assault ending and charged with the offence of affray. He was not released on bail. He has been in custody since that time.

Applicant's Submissions on Sentence
27The applicant agreed with the facts set out above. He did not give evidence on sentence. A pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service was made available to the sentencing Judge as was a report of Ms Debbie Case, a psychologist with Duffy Robilliard Psychologists.

28The Probation and Parole Service report recorded that the applicant was born in September 1988 and accordingly, was 21 years old at the time of the offence. 

29The pre-sentence report indicated that the applicant, who was then 23 years old, had been in a de facto relationship intermittently for eight years and as a result of that union, had two children for whom he was responsible.

30It noted that he had limited schooling, leaving prior to the completion of Year 10, but since leaving school he had attained a number of certificates and trade qualifications. It also noted his criminal history, the details of which are set out later in this judgment.

31The case manager concluded:

""Mr Apthorpe presents as an immature, young twenty-three year old who was co-operative throughout the preparations for this report. He appears to have had a supportive and stable family unit throughout his formative years and continues to have the benefit of a supportive family and partner. It is concerning that he did not appear to take responsibility in relation to the offences and his failure to verbalise the impact his actions had on the victim.""

32The psychologist's report of Ms Debbie Case which was prepared shortly prior to the sentencing hearing, in addition to the matters which have already been recounted, although perhaps in some greater detail, concluded with this expression of opinion:

""Presently Phillip is in a relationship with a partner who has also experienced considerable dysfunction and adversity within her family or origin. In response Phillip has acted impulsively and aggressively, culminating in his involvement in the index offences.

On a positive note, Phillip does not suffer from substance dependence and is involved in a pro-social supportive relationship. He has a positive work history, enjoys work and intends on resuming work immediately post release. ...

Phillip appears to have been experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety since his father's death. In more recent years these symptoms have increased following the death of close friends and his involvement in a serious automobile accident. ...

The results of psychometric testing indicate that Phillip responded in an exaggerated manner. ... Although his profile should be considered with some caution there was evidence of some Schizotypal personality traits and numerous clinical issues including anxiety, dysthymia, major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder which required immediate intervention. ... Phillip's personality style also indicates impairment in his ability to interpret communications and motivations of others. Together with his fear of victimisation, he is more likely to act/react inappropriately.""

33The report concluded by suggesting that the applicant might benefit from ongoing psychiatric or psychological care. It said;

""Phillip may benefit from psychotherapy to address his problematic personality characteristics. In addition to his personality issues his anxiety and dysthmia require immediate intervention. Phillip demonstrated symptoms consistent with Major Depressive Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder which also requires immediate assessment and treatment.""

34A report from Dr Girgis dealt with the general state of health of the applicant, dealing in particular with orthopaedic injuries arising from a motor vehicle accident.

35Contrary to the suggestion of the sentencing Judge, none of the expert reports which were tendered diagnosed a bipolar condition.

36Counsel for the applicant submitted to the sentencing Judge that given the nature of his physical disabilities, the depression which the applicant suffered and the progress which he had made in custody, that it would be appropriate for a sentence to be imposed that did not require him to spend any further period of time in prison and that any non-parole period which was imposed ought to terminate on that day. 

Applicant's Criminal History
37Relevantly, the applicant had, in 2006, been convicted in the Campbelltown Children's Court of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In respect of these offences, he received a community service order and a bond. 

38In 2007, the applicant was convicted in the Downing Centre Local Court of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, for which he received a term of imprisonment of 12 months including a non-parole period of 6 months. He was also convicted of an offence of affray for which he received a term of imprisonment of 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 months. The two terms of imprisonment were ordered to be served concurrently.

39Although he appealed to the District Court of NSW against the sentences that had been imposed and his conviction, the District Court confirmed the conviction and the sentence, but varied the commencement date to 17 September 2007, to take account of the fact that he had been on bail pending the appeal. 

40Whilst those proceedings were taking place, the applicant had been charged with a further offence of assault, which was committed on 4 May 2007. On 1 June 2007, he was sentenced at the Campbelltown Local Court with respect to the common assault. He received a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months, which bond expired in June 2008.

41On 19 January 2010, the applicant was dealt with at the Campbelltown Local Court for an offence of stalking/ intimidating intending to cause fear of physical or mental harm. He was convicted and a bond under s 9 was imposed for a 12 month period. This bond expired on 18 January 2011. It was during his period of being at liberty, and subject to this bond that he committed the offence which is the subject of this application.

Remarks on Sentence
42The sentencing Judge dealt with all of the co-offenders except Mr Jayden Hunter, at the one time. He described the attack, in which the applicant participated, as cowardly and ""...the worst affray upon which I have come."" He noted that affray was a commonly charged offence. 

43There is no doubt that the Agreed Facts entirely justified the sentencing Judge's description of the attack as cowardly and of the affray being a serious one.

44In discussing the individual circumstances applicable to the applicant, the sentencing Judge noted, from the pre-sentence report, that the applicant did not have any insight into, nor any comprehension of, the seriousness of his offending behaviour. This was an unsurprising conclusion as the applicant had told the Probation and Parole Officer who prepared the pre-sentence report, that the victim ""... got what he deserved"".

45The sentencing Judge allowed a discount of 15 per cent on the sentence by reason of the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty. 

46The sentencing judge found special circumstances by reason of the need for the applicant to have treatment for his psychiatric condition and because the applicant, during his period in custody prior to the sentence being imposed, had made good use of his time in undertaking courses designed to assist in the success of his rehabilitation. 

Grounds of Appeal
47There are three grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant. They are these:

(1)His Honour erred in considering factual matters on sentence which did not apply to the appellant.

(2)His Honour erred on a parity basis between the sentences imposed on the appellant and Graham Apthorpe.

(3)His Honour erred in determining a sentence which in all of the circumstances was manifestly excessive. 

Ground 1 - Factual matters which did not apply 
48The applicant submits to this Court that the sentencing Judge made a number of factual errors in his Remarks on Sentence. 

49There were two factual errors made in the course of the sentencing remarks by the sentencing Judge. These two errors related to the facts of what had occurred. The errors were made because the Agreed Facts differed slightly between each of the co-offenders. The course of the sentencing submissions did not alert the Judge to that fact. 

50During the course of the imposition of sentence his Honour recited the Agreed Facts with respect to one of the co-offenders, which did not in their entirety, apply to the applicant. Counsel for the applicant drew his Honour's attention to the differences. 

51His Honour then said:

""Counsel for Phillip Apthorpe has now risen to his feet and pointed out that there are some differences between the facts that I have recorded and the facts agreed between the Crown and Phillip Apthorpe, on which Phillip Apthorpe stands for sentence. I have recited the facts from the facts agreed between Graham Apthorpe and the Crown with the significant omission of the matter that I said does not bind Ryan Sloane. Were I to analyse the facts against each accused separately, I might finish passing sentence by Sunday evening. I will recite the facts against Phillip to show in general terms what the offences are, the facts against each of the accused as agreed between each of the offenders and the Crown will be taken separately into account in the passing of the sentence.""

52Although his Honour's words were not as clear as they might have been, it seems to me that what his Honour was saying was that he had used the facts which he had thus far recited, as a general description of the events which had occurred, and that when considering the particular sentences to be imposed upon each offender, he would have regard to the specific agreed facts, to the extent that there was any difference between them and those which he had recited.

53The recited facts which were said to be erroneous, consisted, principally of two matters. The first was that the sentencing judge attributed to the applicant words to the effect ""Get him. Fuck him up"", whereas the agreed facts did not identify the speaker of these words. The second were remarks which principally relate to the offence, on the Form 1, of damaging the car. 

54Upon careful consideration, the differences between the recited facts and those to which the applicant agreed, are not significant.

55Insofar as the facts relating to the affray were concerned, his Honour expressed the view that it was ""hard to distinguish the relative culpability of any of the offenders"". He did not find that the applicant initiated the affray, which was the impact of the erroneous attribution. Such a finding, if made, was likely to have resulted in a longer sentence than that actually imposed.

56The second factual error related to the circumstances of the damage and the motor vehicle which was an offence in the Form 1. It is not clear, and I am not satisfied that this error has impacted in any way upon the sentence imposed. His Honour seems to have regarded the Form 1 offences as being relatively minor. He did not discuss them separately.

57His Honour also found when dealing with Ms Case's report, that the applicant had reported a diagnosis of bipolar condition. The applicant had not been so diagnosed, but his brother had. The sentencing Judge's conclusion is erroneous in this respect.

58However, the relevance of the applicant's mental health seems to have influenced the sentencing judge's favourable conclusion as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, and a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. To the extent that the erroneous finding was made, it was used to benefit the applicant in the sentencing judge's views.

59There is no error of substance here which has affected the sentence. 

60In my opinion, this Ground fails.

Ground 3 - The sentence was manifestly excessive
61It is convenient to deal with this Ground next. 

62It was submitted that both the non-parole period and the balance of term were manifestly excessive. The submission in large part relied upon statistics from the Judicial Commission of NSW. 

63Based upon those statistics, the applicant submits that at the time of sentencing, the longest total sentence which had been imposed for an affray was 36 months. Yet, it was said the total sentence here was 40 months.

64As well, the applicant submits that the actual seriousness of the affray, the objective seriousness of the applicant's participation in the affray and the applicant's subjective situation, all combine to demonstrate that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

65The statistics upon which the applicant relies in this Court, are substantially the same as those provided to the sentencing Judge.

66This Court has expressed the view on many occasions, that considerable circumspection is necessary in taking into account and relying upon statistics of the kind that the applicant calls in aid of a submission that a sentence is manifestly excessive: R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247 at [48]; R v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43 at [98]-[101]. 

67In this case, there is an added complication, which is that the maximum penalty for the offence of affray was doubled from five years to ten years in 2005. The statistics provided span the period of both maximum penalties. 

68Whatever be the factual basis for a submission that this ground is made out, the legal test requires the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J. In approaching the task of establishing if the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the context is that there is no one single correct sentence, but the process of sentencing involves due allowance for differences of judicial opinion at first instance whilst still acting in accordance with principle: Vuni v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33] per Hoeben J (Tobias JA and James J agreeing); see also Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16]-[17] per Hodgson JA (Buddin and Price JJ agreeing). 

69The applicant has not, in support of this ground, identified any error of principle or fact which would constitute any of the forms of error identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 as the basis for this Court to interfere with the exercise of the discretion of the primary Judge, other than the last - the inference that, by reference to the result, there has been (or must have been) a failure properly to exercise the discretion conferred on the sentencing Judge.

70It is clear from the limited statistics referred to that the sentence falls outside the highest sentence previously imposed, but by a relatively modest margin. However, the question that remains for this Court is whether the sentence falls within the range of the permissible exercise of the sentencing Judge's discretion.

71In my opinion, having regard to the factual circumstances and the applicant's subjective situation to which I have referred above, it does. 

72The affray was very serious. It was part of an ongoing dispute between two families. The numbers involved on one side, five, as against a single victim demonstrated that the victim would have been in significant fear for his safety and life. The assaults perpetrated upon the victim continued over a sustained period of time. 

73The applicant had a poor previous criminal history. He was on, and in breach of, a bond at the time of the offence. This is an aggravating factor which must be taken into account on sentence.

74In my opinion, the applicant has not shown that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, that it was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" nor that any lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

75This Ground ought be rejected.

Ground 2 - Error on a parity basis
76This Ground invokes the parity principle. 

77The applicant confines this submission only to a comparison with the sentence imposed on his brother, Graham. He submits that by reference to the sentence imposed on his brother, the Court ought accept that the sentence imposed on the applicant was such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. 

78Mr Graham Apthorpe, the applicant's brother, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment without parole of 20 months, with an additional balance of term of 20 months, totalling 40 months.

79It is to be observed that the head sentence for both Mr Graham Apthorpe and the applicant were the same, but the applicant was sentenced to a longer non-parole period by 4 months, namely 24 months as opposed to 20 months. 

80The applicant submits that having regard to the greater participation of Mr Graham Apthorpe in the altercation, namely, that he commenced the altercation, and threw the first four or five punches to the victim's face, and in addition, that it was Graham Apthorpe who was identified as being principally responsible for the damage to the victim's motor vehicle, there was no reason why they both should have been ordered to serve identical head sentences. It is also submitted that the subjective differences between Mr Graham Apthorpe and the applicant did not justify identical head sentences.

81However, when dealing with the principal offences of affray, his Honour found that there was little to distinguish the relative culpability of any of the offenders. In his Remarks on Sentence he said:

""With the utmost respect to those who submitted otherwise, it is hard to distinguish the relative culpability of any of the offenders, except to state that Graham Apthorpe commenced the affray.""

82It not submitted that this finding was in error. It is clear that the material before the sentencing Judge amply supported such a conclusion. 

83In order to succeed on this ground, as the authorities demonstrate, the mere existence of a discrepancy is insufficient to warrant intervention by an appellate court. 

84What an applicant needs to establish is that the discrepancy identified is one which is ""marked"" or ""clearly unjustifiable"", or ""manifest ... such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance"" or else it ""[appears] that justice has not been done"": Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606, Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 323 per Gummow J, at 338 per Kirby J; Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 86 ALJR 36 at [31] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, at [105] per Bell J.

85The sentencing Judge correctly found that the criminality of all the offenders was substantially the same. Imposing the same head sentence in those circumstances was justified.

86The applicant's personal circumstances, including his previous criminal record, were sufficient to justify the difference in the non-parole period between his sentence and that of Mr Graham Apthorpe.

87If anything, the applicant seems to be complaining that his brother, Graham Apthorpe's head sentence ought to have been longer. This is not a proper engagement with the parity principle.

88I am not satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated that any discrepancy which exists is marked, or clearly unjustifiable. He has not demonstrated that justice has not been done.

89I would not uphold the appeal on this Ground.

Summary
90For the reasons which I have described above, I do not think there is any basis upon which this Court ought interfere in this appeal.

91It is for these reasons that I joined in with the orders of the Court which were made on Friday 27 April 2012; which were:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

		22 May 2012",2012-05-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759291,Robinson v R [2012] NSWCCA 26,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with Davies J.

2ROTHMAN J:   I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J and generally with his reasons therefor.

3Neither sentence is, on its own, manifestly excessive, but the overall sentence imposed is greater than is desirable to reflect the total criminality. As a consequence, the level of accumulation is too great. I agree with Davies J that greater concurrency is appropriate: Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610.

4I do not consider that it is necessary, as distinct from desirable, to explain the reasons for the degree of accumulation or concurrence beyond stating the principle to be applied and the facts upon which it is based. Instinctive synthesis may often result in some lack of transparency. Nevertheless, the result here is excessive and I agree with the orders proposed. 

5DAVIES J:  On 31 October 2008 the Applicant was sentenced after trial for two offences contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Count 1 was the supply of a commercial quantity of MDMA, namely 125.42 grams (contrary to s 25(2) of the Act). The maximum penalty for that offence was 20 years imprisonment or 3,500 penalty units or both. The offence had a standard non-parole period of 10 years.

6Count 2 was for the supply of a prohibited drug being 115.5 grams of methylamphetamine (contrary to s 25(1) of the Act). This offence carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment or 2000 penalty units or both. There was no standard non-parole period for this offence. 

7In respect of Count 1 the Applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing 17 August 2007 and expiring 16 February 2012 with an additional term of 4 years and 6 months to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring 16 August 2016. 

8In respect of the supply of methylamphetamine the Applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 17 August 2010 and expiring 16 August 2013 with an additional term of 3 years to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring 16 August 2016.

9The Sentencing Judge accumulated the sentence for Count 2 in such a way that it commenced 3 years into the sentence for Count 1. In total, therefore, the Applicant received a non-parole period of 6 years with an additional term of 3 years. 

The facts

10What follows is taken from the Sentencing Judge's finding of the facts:

11On 17 August 2007, police received information that the Applicant was involved in the supply and storage of a large commercial quantity of ecstasy at premises at 131 Ramsgate Road, Ramsgate. On that day the police had that property under surveillance. The Applicant was observed by police prior to her arrest to leave the premises just shortly after 1.15pm. 

12At about 1.40pm on 27 August, the Applicant was observed by police to drive a Daihatsu motor sedan on Park Road, Allawah. The Applicant was subsequently stopped and was spoken to by plainclothes police. A short time later the Applicant was taken to Kogarah police station. The Applicant participated in an electronically recorded interview in which she did not make any admissions.

13The Applicant was questioned in relation to the premises at 131 Ramsgate Road, Ramsgate. She stated that the premises belonged to her son and that she and her former husband were in the process of renovating the home. The Applicant told police that two keys were available to gain access to the premises and that one of the keys was in the possession of her son who had been away for a year. The Applicant told police she was in possession of the other key, and that key was found in the possession of the Applicant at the time of her arrest.
14The Applicant told the police in the record of interview that her residential address was 6 Lyle Avenue, Hurstville.

15Police obtained a search warrant for the Ramsgate premises, and at about 8.45pm on 27 August 2007, police executed the search warrant. The Applicant indicated she wished to be present during the search. The search was videotaped and the jury had the opportunity of viewing the offender and the premises during the course of the search. The police search was extensive and it included a police dog handler and his dog being present at the search.

16During the execution of the search warrant police located in various locations in the home the drugs the subject of the offences contained in the indictment. In particular police located in a room which contained clothing and personal papers of the Applicant the ecstasy tablets, which are the subject of the first charge contained in the indictment. Additionally, police located in a various locations in the premises, in a number of containers, the methylamphetamine which is the subject of the second charge in the indictment. In the area where the drugs were found police located the Applicant's passport and birth certificate. 

17Police also seized clothing and a toothbrush. The Applicant's DNA profile was found to be on the toothbrush and her DNA profile was found on a pair of pyjamas. The Applicant denied any knowledge of the ecstasy pills and methylamphetamine. The Applicant was conveyed to Kogarah police station. She was again offered the opportunity to participate in an electronically recorded interview which she declined.

18Whilst the Applicant was at the police station, police continued their search of the premises and in two locations in the bedroom located $15,795 in Australian currency. The money was located in close proximity to where the drugs were located by police.

19His Honour was satisfied on those facts that the Applicant's role in relation to the drugs was that of warehouser for commercial gain. His Honour found that the Applicant was not addicted to drugs and that she did not have drugs for dealing to feed any drug habit. 

20His Honour then had regard to the amount and purity of the drugs. In relation to the MDMA his Honour noted that the cut off point between the indictable quantity and the commercial quantity was 125 grams and that the total weight of the tablets was 125.42 grams. The purity was in the vicinity of 30%. 

21In relation to the methylamphetamine the cut off point for the indictable quantity is five grams and for the commercial quantity the cut off point is 250 grams. The amount of methylamphetamine seized was 115.50 grams and its purity varied between 1.5% and 32.5%.

22His Honour concluded that the Applicant's criminality lay beneath the middle of the range of objective seriousness for each offence. His Honour noted that the Crown conceded that there were no aggravating factors to be considered. 

Grounds of appeal

23The grounds of appeal set out in the Notice of Appeal are these:

1. The manner and extent of accumulation is erroneous in the circumstances of this case.

2. The overall sentence is manifestly excessive.

24In the written submissions the Applicant refers to a third ground (numbered Ground 2 in those submissions) as follows:

The sentencing judge failed to assert, with a proper indication of degree, the extent to which the objective seriousness of the commercial offence departed from the mid range of objective seriousness.

In a supplementary submission the Applicant indicated that this ground was now abandoned because of the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39.

Subjective features

25The Applicant was born on 3 April 1949 and was therefore aged 59 years at the time of the sentence. She had a criminal record which included four stealing offences between 1988 and 1993, two offences involving fraud on the Commonwealth in 1990, and two offences for supplying a prohibited drug in 2005. Those drug supply offences were dealt with at the same time. For the first of them the Applicant was sentenced to a period of 21 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 months, and for the second to a fixed term of imprisonment for 11 months entirely concurrent with the first offence. 

26The Sentencing Judge had a report from a clinical psychologist Mr John Taylor. He administered a series of tests to her and concluded that she suffered from severe depression. He found that she did not have a significant predisposition to engage in substance abuse and that she had a low to moderate risk of recidivism. He noted that it was the Applicant's view that she had been set up by someone in relation to these offences, and she was very angry about the matter. Further, she was not prepared to acknowledge all of the offences on her record because she claimed that her identity had been stolen many years earlier. She acknowledged that she had committed the offences against the Commonwealth but claimed in relation to the offences of supply prohibited drugs that she did not know they were in the motor vehicle when she was stopped for a traffic violation.

27The Sentencing Judge noted that the Applicant came from a stable family, that she had three relationships, with the second being the longest at twenty-two years and producing two children. The third relationship broke up because the partner was a drug addict and subjected the applicant to violence.

28Until February 2006 the Applicant was in good health. At that time she was assaulted in custody and suffered injuries to her neck and right arm. She also suffered emotional sequelae which appears to have triggered a recurrence of earlier depression from which she had suffered.

Ground 1:  The manner and extent of accumulation is erroneous in the circumstances of this case

Ground 2:  The overall sentence is manifestly excessive

29The grounds of appeal were argued together but it will be necessary to decide if there was an error in relation to the accumulation before considering whether the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

30Whilst there is no appeal against the sentence for Count 1 a number of submissions on behalf of the Applicant lead to the view that a challenge was being collaterally made to that sentence under cover of the expressed grounds argued. First, reference was made to R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78, a case that was provided to the sentencing judge as a guide to the sentence that he should impose. The Applicant submitted that the head sentence imposed by this Court in that case was two years greater ""and manifestly excessive in comparison"" for one third of the quantity of MDMA that was the subject of the offence in Blair. 

31Secondly, the Applicant said that no complaint was made about the way the sentence was structured in that the Applicant was obliged to serve a discrete 3 year non-parole period for Count 1. That appears to be a submission that a 3 year non-parole period was appropriate for Count 1 with some extra period for Count 2, but that the extra period should be set having regard to the sentence in Blair. 
32Thirdly, the Applicant submitted that, ""after what was considered an appropriate amelioration in penalty on account of the totality principles the (effective) non parole period for the commercial sentence was increased by three years"", and that this constituted an error in the exercise of discretion.

33Despite these submissions the appeal must be decided on the grounds in the Notice of Appeal. The Court raised with the Applicant the fact that no appeal had been brought against the severity of the sentence for Count 1 but no application to amend was made. Of course, there was an immediate difficulty for the Applicant in contending that the sentence for Count 1 was manifestly excessive, particularly when there was a standard non-parole period of 10 years, the Applicant was found guilty after a trial, and she had two prior convictions for supplying drugs. Indeed the Applicant's counsel acknowledged that the standard non-parole period would have properly been weighing on his Honour's consideration, and that he may well have felt constrained by what was thought at the time to be the proper approach to standard non-parole periods following R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168.

34No complaint is, or could be, made about the accumulation of the head sentences because they are entirely concurrent. The complaint made is that the partial accumulation of the non-parole period for Count 2 was too great to reflect properly the total criminality of the two offences. That accumulation is also said to result in the manifest excess about which complaint is made.

The sentencing hearing

35The sentencing proceeded in a slightly unusual way. The Sentencing Judge first related the facts giving rise to the offences. His Honour then observed that the offences were serious offences which were reflected in the maximum penalties in the Act. His Honour referred to the fact that a standard non-parole period applied to the first offence, that it was necessary for him to consider the objective seriousness of that offence, and in doing so he needed to look at the Applicant's role together with the quantity and purity of the drugs.

36His Honour was satisfied that the Applicant had the role of a warehouser for commercial gain. He then dealt with the weight and purity of the drugs, as earlier indicated and he made the finding of where in the scale of objective seriousness the offences lay. Noting the Crown's concession of no aggravating features, he said that in the light of the Applicant's criminal history he could not provide her with any leniency. 

37His Honour went on to consider subjective matters including the report of the psychologist Mr W J Taylor. 

38His Honour then said this:

I will stop there. I don't think I can go any further. What do you say? Have I covered everything which has to be covered?

39The Crown Prosecutor said his Honour had, and then indicated that he would like to hand to him the case of Blair. Counsel for the Applicant was apparently waiting for a further report from Mr Taylor. His Honour then indicated that he was going to adjourn, saying:

...I thank you for the judgment and I'll have a look at that judgment. So I'll say again I'll deal with the report when it comes in, I'll then look to the rehabilitation question, the re-offending question, special circumstances question and then deliver my sentences.

40The following exchange then occurred between his Honour and the Prosecutor about Blair:

HIS HONOUR: What sentence was imposed here?

HUGGETT: I think it was five years minimum term and that offender I think had no previous - and it was an amount not dissimilar to this amount 270-odd grams I think.

HIS HONOUR: Of what?

HUGGETT: I think it's the same drug your Honour. Sorry I've read it a while ago. I think it's the same drug.

HIS HONOUR: I think it's -

HUGGETT: It was methylamphetamine.

HIS HONOUR: Methylamphetamine yeah.

HUGGETT: And it was only one count.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

HUGGETT: And he had a previous history but no drug offences. Found that he was sort of a store person effectively.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

HUGGETT: And in fact he was just picking the drug up and minding it overnight, not knowing what it was. No evidence of any financial gain. I think the amount was two-

HIS HONOUR: Non-parole period of five years, three months.

HUGGETT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Total term of seven years so that they didn't find special circumstances.

HUGGETT: I don't know to be quite honest.

HIS HONOUR: What's five sevenths which closer to statutory (sic).

HUGGETT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well as you know Madam Crown it's not a mathematical exercise.

HUGGETT: No.

HIS HONOUR: It's not a scientific skill to apply intuitive synthesis but I thank you for the judgment and I'll have a look at that judgment. So I'll say again I'll deal with the report when it comes in, I'll then look to the rehabilitation question, the re-offending question, special circumstances question and then deliver my sentences.

41Upon resumption there were some short submissions about the further report of Mr Taylor. When they were concluded his Honour continued with his Remarks on Sentence. He found special circumstances in that the Applicant required ongoing rehabilitation in the community. Thereafter the following exchange occurred:

HIS HONOUR: In sentencing the offender it is necessary for me to sentence her in respect of each offence and necessary for me to consider the accumulation or partial accumulation of these sentences in order that the sentences I impose today reflects the totality of the criminality of the offender.

I have heard no submission in relation to that but it is my intention to partially accumulate the sentences in accordance with the principle contained in Pearce's case.

I see no response from the bar table.

HUGGETT: No I don't oppose the partial accumulation your Honour.

FLOOD: Couldn't do so.

HIS HONOUR: Sorry?

FLOOD: I couldn't do so.

HIS HONOUR: Yes thank you. ...

42Thereafter his Honour imposed the sentences I have set out earlier. As can be seen counsel for the Applicant did not oppose partial accumulation of the sentences to reflect the totality of the criminality.

Submissions on appeal

43The Applicant directed particular attention to Blair and to a comparison of the amount of the drug in that case and the sentence imposed by this Court on appeal. The Applicant submitted that his Honour acted on an understanding (derived from what the Crown said in the exchange I have set out above) that the amount of the drug in Blair was similar to the total amount in the present case. In fact in Blair there was one drug being methylamphetamine with a weight of 371.3 grams described as being of extremely low purity. I have no doubt that his Honour was not misled by what the Crown mistakenly said of Blair. His Honour indicated that he would read the judgment over the luncheon adjournment, and I have no doubt that he did so.

44The applicant in Blair had no prior drug convictions but had what were described as ""previous significant convictions"" although those convictions were not specified. The Trial Judge sentenced Blair to a non-parole period of 10 years with a total term of 13 years 4 months. The Trial Judge, having found that the offence was in the mid-range of objective seriousness (partly because of an error he made in saying where the amount of the drug fell within the commercial range), felt constrained by the decision in R v Way not to deviate from the standard non-parole period.

45On appeal this Court considered that, because the Appellant was not a principal but in a lesser role as a courier and storeman and because the weight of the prohibited drug was in the lower part of the range and of extremely low purity, the offence did not answer the description of one that fell within the mid-range of seriousness. This Court quashed the sentence and substituted a non-parole period of five years three months with an additional term of one year and nine months.

46The approach the Applicant took in the present case rather suggested that the Court should overlook the fact that there were two different types of drugs and simply consider the two drugs together as a total quantity of some 240 grams. That quantity, the Applicant suggested, is to be compared to the position in Blair which would show that the present sentence was manifestly excessive.

47The Applicant also pointed to the successful appeals to this Court in a series of cases involving co-offenders, being McKellar v R [2010] NSWCCA 295, Locke v R [2010] NSWCCA 296, O'Brien v R [2010] NSWCCA 297 and Ellis v R [2010] NSWCCA 298. The amount of the drug concerned in three of those cases was three times the amount of the combined weight of the drugs in the present case. All of the offenders were aged 19 or 20 at the time of the commission of the offences, one of them had no previous criminal record and the other two had what could only be described as minor criminal convictions. 

48The Crown submitted that, subject to established principle, questions of concurrency and accumulation are matters falling within the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. The Crown submitted further, and without contention from the Applicant, that possession of two different kinds of drugs is not properly regarded as one episode of criminality: Luu v R [2008] NSWCCA 285. 

Consideration

49It is necessary, first, to consider the matter of the accumulation of the sentences. In McKellar, RA Hulme J (with whom Simpson & Hoeben JJ agreed) made reference to the proper approach in relation to whether sentences should be served concurrently or accumulatively. He said:

[61] The decision as to whether to order sentences to be served concurrently or accumulatively, either in whole or in part, is clearly discretionary but it is guided by principle. In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41, Howie J succinctly stated:

[27] In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.

[62] In R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 481, the Court (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ) stated:

[13] In some cases the fact that a sentence for a particular offence is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence will result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender was to be punished for the two acts of offending: see for example R v Brown [1999] NSWCCA 323. This may be so even if the two offences arise from the same precise criminal act, such as the dangerous driving of a motor vehicle on the one occasion: R v Janceski (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 288. The same principle has been applied to sexual assault offences arising from a single incident of sexual assault: R v Gorman (2002) 137 A Crim R 326. Although, it has been held that a determination of the extent, if any, that a sentence is to be served cumulatively with another sentence is an exercise of discretion on which minds might differ, R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66, that discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality.

50In Locke the Applicant was charged with four offences. The first was the ongoing supply of MDMA between 3 and 25 April 2008 of a total of 20.62 grams. The second offence was supplying more than the indictable quantity of MDMA, namely 360.28 grams between 22 April and 29 June 2008. The third was for supplying not less than the commercial quantity of MDMA, namely 296.01 grams on 14 August 2008. The fourth count was of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of MDMA being 83 grams between 21 May and 24 July 2008. The Applicant pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and was given a 25% discount on sentence. 

51The Sentencing Judge imposed a 3 year fixed term of imprisonment for the first offence, a 4 year fixed term for the second offence to commence 1 year after the start of the first sentence. For the third offence he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years to commence 1 year after the sentence commenced for the second offence. For the fourth offence he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to commence 1 year after the commencement of the sentence for the third offence.

52On appeal to this Court it was determined that the one year accumulation on each of the sentences should be reduced to 6 months for each of them. It may be accepted that the Applicant in that case was 19 years of age at the time and had only minor prior convictions. Nevertheless, there was much less commonality in the offences charged than in the present case, and this Court considered that the sentences should each be accumulated by only 6 months. 

53Similarly, in O'Brien there were four offences charged with three being the offences of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of MDMA, the total amount of the drugs being 748 grams. For an offence of supplying MDMA the Applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years. Each of the subsequent offences of supplying not less than a commercial quantity was accumulated on the prior sentence to the extent of 12 months, 6 months and 18 months respectively. On appeal, the accumulation in each case was reduced to a 6 month period. There was some but not entire commonality associated with the offences. 

54In Ellis, the Applicant was charged with three offences of supplying more than the indictable quantity of MDMA and two offences of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of MDMA. There was some but not entire commonality in the offending. On the first offence of supplying more than the indictable quantity the Applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months. The next count of supplying not less than a commercial quantity was accumulated by 9 months as was the third count of supplying not less than a commercial quantity. Again, this Court reduced the period of accumulation for the two subsequent offences each to 6 months. 

55In McKellar, the Applicant was charged with supplying more than an indictable quantity of MDMA being 19.01 grams for which he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months. He was also charged with supplying not less than a commercial quantity of MDMA being 190.25 grams in 35 separate transactions at a different period in time from the earlier offence. His sentence of 3 years non-parole was accumulated on the first sentence to the extent of a year. On appeal the period of accumulation of the second offence was reduced to a 3 month period. 

56The matter of the appropriate accumulation of those offences was a consideration in McKellar. After discussing the principles involved RA Hulme J went on to say:

[64] In my view it was open to his Honour to have considered that there was additional criminality inherent in the s 25(1) offence, particularly having regard to the not insignificant quantity of drug involved (15 times the indictable quantity). There was, however, a significant overlap with the criminality inherent in the s 25(2) offence in the sense that it represented a continuation of the same activity. 

[65] The appropriateness of the sentencing outcome in terms of the totality principle may be tested in this fashion. The commercial quantity offence was a ""rolled up"" charge, in that it combined numerous individual supply offences committed over a period of time. It would have been open to the prosecution to include within that ""rolling up"" the applicant's possession for the purpose of supply of the 19 grams of MDMA on 26 September 2008. That would have extended the period of the commercial quantity offence from about 19 weeks to about 22 weeks and increased the quantity of drug involved from 190 grams to 209 grams. Would the sentence for such a charge be any different from the one in fact imposed? I would answer that question, ""Yes, but only marginally so"".

[66] I accept that it was open to the prosecution to prefer the two charges as they did. However, a proper application of the totality principle should have seen a lesser degree of accumulation.


57 It may be accepted that the notion of instinctive synthesis comes particularly to the fore when questions of partial accumulation and totality are being considered because a discretion is being exercised. A sentencing judge will not necessarily fall into error because he or she does not set out in detail how the precise period of any accumulation is reached. Nevertheless, it is desirable that some remarks should be addressed to the factors which have been taken into account: McKellar at [63]. A failure to do so may result in this Court concluding, where the sentence or the measure of accumulation appears unreasonable or unjust, that there has been a manifest error in the application of principle relevant to the exercise of the discretion: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.

58In my opinion that is the position in this case. His Honour did not say why he accumulated the sentences in the manner he did, and the overall resulting sentence is unreasonably high. When it is remembered that both drugs were found at the same locations in the same premises at the same time the commonality of these matters highlighted the need for his Honour to explain why he adopted the course he did. His Honour, who is a very experienced trial judge, was mindful of the totality principle - he referred to Pearce - but did not relate the principles to the facts he found. One explanation for the overall sentence (as mentioned earlier ) may be that his Honour felt more constrained by the standard non-parole period in respect of Count 1 than would now be thought necessary: Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [17] and [26] - ]28].

59A proper application of the totality principle would, in my opinion, have resulted in a lesser period of accumulation. Some guidance is available from the four related cases to which I have referred. Two factors tell against the Applicant by comparison with the appellants in those cases. First, they were young (19 to 21). Secondly, they had either no prior convictions or relatively minor convictions, unlike the present Applicant who has two prior convictions for supplying drugs. On the other hand, apart from McKellar, the quantity of the drugs in those cases greatly exceeded the quantity in the present case, and the facts showed a more systematic supply organisation

60When these matters are balanced I consider the sentence in relation to Count 2 should have commenced two years after the sentence for Count 1 commenced. The result is an overall sentence of a non-parole period of five years with no change to the additional term.

61On the basis that this Court came to re-sentence the Applicant she tendered at the hearing of the appeal a further report from Tim Watson-Munro. The report referred to the suicide of one of her children in November 2009, and made reference to the effect this had had on the Applicant whilst in custody. The deceased daughter had a young son who was being cared for by two of the Applicant's other children and her de facto husband. One of these children of the Applicant suffers a range of psychological disabilities and behavioural difficulties. As a result of these matters coupled with her incarceration the Applicant was highly agitated and anxious when seen by Mr Watson-Munro. He considered that she needed a Mental Care Health Plan.

62If the adjustment is made to the accumulation of the sentences that I have proposed it does not appear to me that the overall sentence is manifestly excessive. The Applicant's prior convictions together with her lack of acceptance of responsibility for these offences provide support for that view. Although Mr Watson-Munro's report identifies difficulties that the Applicant is experiencing because of family-related matters I do not consider that it contains anything to warrant any further adjustment to the sentence.
Conclusion

63I propose the following orders:

(1)  Grant leave to appeal.

(2)  Quash the sentence of Solomon DCJ of 31 October 2008 in respect of Count 2.

(3)  In lieu thereof sentence the Appellant to a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 17 August 2009 and expiring 16 August 2012 with an additional term of 3 years to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring 16 August 2015.

		21 May 2012",2012-05-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759294,Tweeddale v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 99,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA:  On 12 October 2010, the appellant pleaded guilty to one count of reckless wounding contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 35(4) and one count of offer to confer a benefit with the intent to influence a witness in a judicial proceeding contrary to the Crimes Act, s 321(1)(a) (the s 321(1)(a) offence).  The offence of reckless wounding carried a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.  The s 321(1)(a) offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.
2On 16 November 2010, the appellant was sentenced by Hosking DCJ to the following terms of imprisonment.  In respect of the offence of reckless wounding, the appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 12 January 2012 and expiring on 11 January 2015.  The appellant was sentenced to an additional term of 18 months, expiring on 11 July 2016. In respect of the s 321(1)(a) offence, the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months, commencing on 12 January 2011 and expiring on 11 January 2012.  
3The appellant has appealed against his conviction in respect of the s 321(1)(a) offence and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the reckless wounding offence.
4The Crown concedes that the conviction on the s 321(1)(a) offence cannot be maintained.  The consequences which flow from that are dealt with below.  
Background facts
5Subject to one factual matter which is at the heart of the application for leave to appeal against sentence, the facts as found by the trial judge in his remarks on sentence are not in dispute.  Accordingly, the following review of those facts is derived from his Honour's remarks.  
6The reckless wounding offence occurred at about midnight on 25 April 2010.  The appellant, Jay Betcke (the victim of the wounding) and Mr Betcke's girlfriend Emma Thomas, were at a party.  As Mr Betcke, Ms Thomas and others were leaving, Mr Betcke heard the appellant ""mouthing off"" about Ms Thomas.  Mr Betcke did not know the appellant.  However, Ms Thomas had been friends with him for about two years.  
7Mr Betcke turned around and told the appellant to ""shut up"", saying words to the effect, ""[t]hat's my girlfriend you're talking about and you won't be doing nothing while I'm around"".  The appellant was heard to reply, ""... [y]ou want to have a go"".  Mr Betcke turned around and saw the appellant running towards him from about 20 metres away.  When the appellant was a ""couple of metres"" from him, Mr Betcke saw him ""bend down and smash a glass bottle on the ground"" and then ""[have] a go"" at Ms Thomas' brother.  Mr Betcke grabbed Ms Thomas' brother, pulled him out of the way and stood between him and the appellant.  The appellant then ""came at Mr Betcke and held the bottle to his throat"".  Mr Betcke could feel the bottle cutting into his throat.  He told the offender to ""put the bottle away or I'm going to hit you"".  The appellant continued to push the bottle into Mr Betcke's throat, yelling at him that he was going to kill him.
8Mr Betcke was holding a bottle of beer and hit the appellant on the side of the head with it.  The appellant ""went crazy"" at this point and started to punch Mr Betcke.  Mr Betcke pulled the appellant close to him to avoid being struck further and then ""threw"" him down and ""kicked him in the head"".  The two men rolled around on the ground until the police arrived soon afterwards and separated them.  
9In his record of interview with the police, the appellant said that he could only remember ""bits and pieces"" of what had happened that night, principally due to his level of intoxication.  He had also taken some Ecstasy tablets that night.  
10Mr Betcke was given first aid at the scene and was then taken to hospital by ambulance.  According to the statement of facts tendered on the sentence hearing, Mr Betcke was treated at hospital for the following injuries:
2 cm laceration to the vertex of the scalp requiring three sutures;3 cm long deep laceration to the back of the vertex of the scalp requiring two deep sutures;Partial amputation of the rim of the left ear, repaired with four nylon sutures;Laceration to lower left ear, repaired with five sutures;Superficial laceration over left carotid artery;Arterial bleed behind left ear;Laceration on back of right forearm, deep, down to the muscle requiring three deep sutures and five skin sutures.
11A photograph taken of Mr Betcke in hospital showed him with a significant amount of blood on his face, including down the bridge of his nose, across his left cheek and along the jawline on the left side of his face and chin.  According to the statement of facts, the treating doctor did not expect any long term deficit from these injuries, except scars to Mr Betcke's head, ear and arm.  
12In dealing with the reckless wounding offence, his Honour stated:
""Returning then to the sentences with which I am dealing, the s 35 offence is self-evidently, one of extreme violence as I said, involving the offender using a broken bottle as a weapon.  It is clear to me that the offender struck Mr Betcke a number of times with the broken bottle.  Apart from what witnesses say, when one looks at the photographs of Mr Betcke's head that is plainly evident with the number of injuries he sustained consistent only with having been struck a number of separate blows with the broken bottle.
The photographs also show - or one of them shows Mr Betcke in the emergency ward at the Cobar Hospital which is a horrifying photograph showing Mr Betcke with what appear to be significant cuts to his face, his face largely covered in blood and the upper part of his torso also covered in blood as is the pillow or most of it or a lot of it and some other dressings below his head.""  
13His Honour's finding that the photograph of Mr Betcke in the hospital showed ""what appeared to be significant cuts to his face"" is challenged on the sentence appeal.  
The conviction appeal
14The appellant was charged on indictment with the following offence contrary to the Crimes Act, s 321(1)(a) to which he pleaded guilty: 
""That [the appellant] on the 30th day of April 2010, at Cobar, in the State of New South Wales, did offer to confer a benefit on Emma Thomas intending to influence Jay Betcke a person to be called as a witness in a judicial proceeding, to wit, Orange District Court, to not attend as a witness."" 
15Section 321(1)(a) provides: 
""321 Corruption of witnesses and jurors
(1) A person who confers or procures or offers to confer or procure or attempt to procure any benefit on or for any person:(a) intending to influence any person called or to be called as a witness in any judicial proceeding to give false evidence or withhold true evidence or to not attend as a witness or not produce anything in evidence pursuant to a summons or subpoena ...""
16An essential ingredient of the offence is that there is an intention to influence a person called or to be called as a witness in a judicial proceeding.  
17The s 321(1)(a) charge arose out of a series of text messages the appellant sent to Ms Thomas on her mobile phone.  The messages read:  
""Emma I have a deal for ur bf.  Does he want to hear it.""
""My Dad is willing to give ur bf $5,000 to drop the charge.""
""What's the go does he want to make a deal.""  
18Ms Thomas did not respond to any of the messages. 
19At the sentence hearing, the appellant gave the following evidence in relation to this purported offence:  
""Q. And you offered the witness $5,000 is that correct?[A. Yes]
[Q.] You said that your father would pay the money but you never spoke to your father did you?A. No.
Q. And I think you also told the police that you - I mean you wanted [the] matter not to proceed is that right?A. Yes.""  
20The appellant seeks to challenge his conviction on the s 321(1)(a) charge on the basis that the plea was entered in circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice:  the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6. 
21The Crown conceded on the appeal that the evidence did not establish the offence as particularised in the indictment and that the plea to the charge on the indictment should not have been accepted.  The evidence was that the appellant offered to confer a benefit on Mr Betcke, whereas the indictment charged that the appellant offered to confer a benefit on Ms Thomas.  
22The Crown's concession was correctly made.  The appeal against conviction should be allowed and the conviction set aside.  The question then arises as to what other orders, if any, this Court should make.  
23The Crown submitted there was sufficient evidence to establish that the appellant committed an offence contrary to the Crimes Act, s 319, of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice.  Under that offence, it is not necessary that judicial proceedings had commenced at the time of the commission of the offence.  It is sufficient if an accused person, at the time of offering a bribe or inducement or otherwise acting with intent to pervert the course of justice, was apprehensive that s/he would be prosecuted and acted so as to prevent the prosecution:  Regina v OM [2011] NSWCCA 109;  R v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25;  174 CLR 268;  Kalick v R (1920) 55 DLR 104. 
24Section 319 is not a statutory alternative count to s 321(1)(a).  That offence cannot, therefore, merely be substituted for the s 321(1)(a) offence to which the appellant pleaded guilty.  The Crown submitted that the proper approach, in these circumstances, was for the Court to make an order under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 8A that the proceedings before the Magistrate before whom the appellant pleaded guilty, be continued.  That section provides:
""8A Power of court to order committal proceedings to be continued in certain cases
(1) Where a person deemed to be convicted on indictment under section 105 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, appeals to the court against the conviction, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order that the proceedings before the Magistrate at which the appellant pleaded guilty be continued at a time and place to be specified in the order, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, the miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order that those proceedings be so continued than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.
(2) Where an order is made under subsection (1), the proceedings before the Magistrate shall be continued in all respects as if the appellant had not pleaded guilty and as if those proceedings had been adjourned by the Magistrate to the time and place specified in the order.
Upon the making of the order, the court may, subject to the Bail Act 1978, exercise any power that the Magistrate might have exercised under section 41 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, if the order had been an order made by the Magistrate adjourning the proceedings to the time and place so specified, and the provisions of section 41 of that Act apply to and in respect of the appellant.
(3) The powers conferred on the court by this section are in addition to any other power conferred on the court by this Act.""
25If that course was taken, it would be necessary for the Crown to seek leave to amend the Court Attendance Notice.  This course was followed in R v Wilks [2001] NSWCCA 383.  In that case, the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of break enter and steal contrary to the Crimes Act, s 112(1).  Similarly to the present case, the evidence did not establish that the appellant had committed that offence.  The evidence established that Wilks had committed a lesser offence to which he was prepared to plead guilty.  Wilks requested the Court to substitute a plea of guilty for the lesser offence and to proceed to sentence him for that offence.
26The Court (Bell J, Powell JA and Sully J agreeing) held that the Court did not have that power:  see the Criminal Appeal Act, s 7(2).  The Court considered, however, that the miscarriage of justice which had occurred in the appellant having been wrongly convicted on his plea of guilty was more adequately remedied by an order under s 8A.  
27In my opinion, that is the appropriate course to take in this case.  The contrary was not argued by the appellant. 
The sentence appeal:  the reckless wounding offence
28The ground of appeal on sentence is that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  I have already referred to his Honour's finding that the reckless wounding offence was one of extreme violence.  In sentencing the appellant, his Honour had regard to the following factors.  First, the appellant has, as described by his Honour, ""a very significant record for offences of violence"".  In 2007, the appellant was convicted of the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm.  
29In 2008, the appellant was convicted of resist officer in the execution of duty and intimidate police officer in the execution of duty without actual bodily harm.  On the same date, the appellant was convicted of assault person with intent to commit a serious indictable offence.  He was also convicted of larceny of the sum of approximately $2,000.  In respect of this assault offence, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 12 May 2010 and expiring on 11 November 2011, with a non-parole period expiring on 11 May 2011.  The Crown tendered a fact sheet in respect of this last-mentioned offence.  In short, it involved the appellant assaulting his next door neighbour with a baseball bat.  
30His Honour considered that the appellant's actions on the night of the reckless wounding offence appeared to be ""like the action of somebody who was deranged"".  His Honour noted that the appellant ""claim[ed] to be remorseful for what he did"".  His Honour was doubtful, however, whether the appellant was in fact remorseful, or whether he was sorry for what he had done because of the predicament he found himself in, facing sentence for another offence of violence.  His Honour referred to messages the appellant had posted on Ms Thomas' Facebook page.  His Honour considered those messages, particularly the second one in which the appellant boasted of a previous assault or assaults and threatened more, fortified his:
""... strong conclusion that in his current mental state [the appellant] is a very dangerous individual indeed and presents a very real danger to the general community.""  
31His Honour next referred to the need for general deterrence in respect of persons who wielded ""broken bottles and glasses against others"".  In this regard, his Honour considered that general deterrence in this case was of the ""utmost importance"".  His Honour also considered that specific deterrence was of the ""utmost importance"" because of the need for the appellant to understand that these types of attacks would ""bring appropriately heavy sentences"".  
32His Honour assessed the s 35 offence at the high end of the range in terms of its ""objective gravity"".  His Honour considered that the offence was ""far higher than the medium range of objective seriousness"".  His Honour noted that, as he understood the submission made on behalf of the appellant, it was not contested that the offence was objectively above the mid-range of seriousness.
33His Honour then dealt with the appellant's subjective features.  At the date of sentence, the appellant was 20 years of age.  His Honour recorded that the appellant had experienced an ""unhappy childhood"", as his mother habitually used alcohol to excess and sometimes used illicit drugs.  She apparently had committed criminal offences.  His Honour recorded that the appellant's mother appeared to have been ""a violent woman"", who ""kicked [the appellant] out of his own home at aged about eleven or twelve"".  Notwithstanding this, the appellant remained at school until 17 years of age and had held a number of jobs in the mining industry.  
34According to a Probation and Parole Pre-Sentence Report dated 8 November 2010 tendered on the sentence hearing, the appellant said that, at times, he ""experienced anxiety and depression [and] his depression was often exacerbated whilst under influence of alcohol and/or illicit substances"".  He told the Probation and Parole Officer that he had used steroids to enhance his fitness.  He considered the steroids may have contributed to his already aggressive disposition.  Under the heading ""Anger"", the Probation and Parole Officer recorded:
""[The appellant] reported having an impulsive and disruptive nature which he admitted that this enraged behaviour would intensify when under the influence of alcohol and illicit substances.""  
35His Honour accepted as accurate the summary in the Probation and Parole report:
""[The appellant] is a young man who appears to have experienced a volatile childhood and upbringing however, continues to have the support of his father.  His alcohol and drug abuse have been a significant contributing factor in his offending behaviour.  [The appellant's] current period in custody appears to have given him time to reflect on his aggressive and anti social behaviour.  However, he will need continuing and appropriate interventions to address and change his destructive and violent behaviour.""  
36A report of Anna Robilliard, Forensic Psychologist, dated 6 September 2010, was also tendered on the sentence hearing.
37According to Ms Robilliard's report, the appellant had had a motorbike accident when he was about 17 years of age.  The appellant reported to Ms Robilliard that, in his opinion, his ""behavioural control"" had worsened since the accident.  He acknowledged that he had ""always had an anger problem"", but told her:
""I get angry a lot faster, especially on alcohol or drugs.  Even sober, little things get me wild.""  
38Ms Robilliard also recorded the appellant's heavy drinking pattern from the age of 15 or 16.  
39Ms Robilliard administered psychometric testing to assess the appellant's risk of re-offending and the impact of his traumatic life experiences on him.  In respect of the appellant's risk of recidivism, the testing placed him in the ""High to Moderate range"".  She recommended that he undertake programs in custody that focussed on identifying those problems that would put the appellant at risk of re-offending.  In relation to the appellant's ""Trauma Attachment Belief Scale"", which was intended to assess the long lasting effects of traumatic life experiences, his score placed him in the top 1 per cent of the population.  Ms Robillard reported:
""This indicates a major disruption to beliefs that effect this individual's ability to relate to others in a healthy manner because of symptoms associated with traumatic life experiences that have produced distorted cognitions.""  
40Under ""Recommendations"", Ms Robilliard reported:
""[The appellant] presents a complex set of problems and needs that will require careful ongoing assessment and treatment.  He is conscious of his potential to hurt others and appeared motivated to help himself in order to reduce his risk of reoffending.""  
41His Honour took into account the appellant's relative youth, but considered that the mitigating effect of that was diminished, because of his record of violent offences coupled with the extreme violence involved in the offence with which his Honour was dealing.  His Honour also found the appellant's present mental state was such that he was a danger to other people.  
42His Honour had specific regard, pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A to the likelihood or not of the appellant re-offending and to the prospects of his rehabilitation.  As to the former, his Honour was not prepared to find it unlikely that the appellant would re-offend.  His Honour considered that ""may depend upon the mental stock that [the appellant] takes of himself in custody and what specialists are able to do for him psychologically"".  His Honour said he was ""unable to make any prediction"" as to the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation.  His Honour said, ""I simply do not know"".  His Honour also took into account the appellant's early plea of guilty and allowed a 25 per cent discount on the sentence that otherwise would have been imposed.
43The starting point for the sentence imposed by the trial judge, before the application of the discount, was close to the maximum penalty for this offence.  It is apparent, therefore, that his Honour considered this was not only a high level of objective seriousness, but was almost at the most serious level.  This assessment arose in part because his Honour found that Mr Betcke had significant cuts to his face.  His Honour's reference to the ""horrifying photograph"" showing this indicates, in my opinion, that he considered the cuts to Mr Betcke's face were also very serious.  The appellant contended, correctly in my opinion, that this finding was unsupported by the evidence.  
44The summary of facts to which I have referred made no reference to any cuts to Mr Betcke's face.  The only possible material that might have constituted such evidence was the photograph of Mr Betcke in the emergency ward at Cobar Hospital.  However, in the absence of any reference to cuts to his face in the agreed statement of facts, being material which appears to have been derived from the hospital records, I am not satisfied that the photograph establishes that Mr Betcke did receive cuts to his face.  Rather, the photograph is consistent with Mr Betcke's face having become bloodied as a result of the bleeding from the significant lacerations recorded in the statement of facts.  
45It follows, in my opinion, that his Honour erroneously took into account a serious injury to Mr Betcke's face that he had not sustained.  Having thus erred in a relevant respect in his assessment of the overall seriousness of the injuries, the question which arises for this Court's consideration is whether any other sentence is warranted in law:  see the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(3).  
Appeal against sentence
46In my opinion, in this case, a less severe sentence is warranted in law.  I have reached this conclusion, not only having regard to the fact that the appellant was wrongly sentenced on the basis that there were injuries to Mr Betcke's face, but also because I have formed the opinion that the sentence imposed was in any event manifestly excessive.  I have not come to this conclusion lightly.  Even leaving out of consideration any injury to the face, the attack and the injuries it caused were horrific.  His Honour considered that the conduct of the appellant appeared to be ""the action of somebody who was deranged"".  I do not think that description was inappropriate.  The appellant himself has recognised that he has an impulsive and disruptive nature and that ""this enraged behaviour"" was intensified when he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
47I also agree with the primary judge that this is a case where general deterrence is of the utmost importance.  As a weapon of choice, a bottle is readily available in nearly every social setting where drinks are served.  A broken bottle is an extremely dangerous weapon, capable of causing grievous injury and even death.  This may be compounded by the heavy use of alcohol and the use of illicit drugs, which invariably accompanies such assaults.  It is apparent from the matters that come before the courts that attacks with broken bottles usually occur suddenly, with ferocity and as a result of the most minor of perceived provocations, such as being bumped, or being the recipient of an unsolicited remark.  Such behaviour is criminal and is totally unacceptable.  The courts are entitled to and should sentence individuals, who engage in such conduct, on the basis that the sentence should reflect an aspect of general deterrence to others.
48The trial judge also considered that specific deterrence in this case was of the utmost importance.  There can be no doubt of that.  The Probation and Parole Pre-Sentence Report and the report of the psychologist, Ms Robilliard, presents the Court with a concerning, but slightly hopeful picture.  It appears from the Pre-Sentence Report that the appellant has some insight into his aggressive and antisocial behaviour.  It is also apparent that he has an understanding that he is prone to anxiety and depression.  He has a serious drug and alcohol problem.  This is all the more serious given his young age.  The slightly hopeful aspect of Ms Robilliard's report was that the appellant's frankness about his history of drug and alcohol abuse, as recorded on an inventory measuring substance dependence (SASSI), was a positive indicator for rehabilitation.  
49The appellant also has a very supportive father and stepmother and he values their support.  He also has proven work skills.  He appears conscious of his potential to hurt others and, in Ms Robilliard's assessment, he appeared motivated to help himself so as to reduce his risk of re-offending.  However, Ms Robilliard has recommended that the appellant have therapeutic intervention in addition to intervention to address his drug and alcohol problem.  
50Notwithstanding the positive indicators for rehabilitation to which I have referred, the trial judge was not prepared to make a finding that there were prospects of rehabilitation.  I do not consider that his Honour erred in making that finding.  The appellant's prospects for rehabilitation are dependent upon a multitude of factors, but most significantly, the appellant's motivation in the future to undertake appropriate treatment for his various and serious psychological problems.  That will require a high level of motivation and persistence on his part.  There are indications that he has the former.  The latter remains unknown.  However, in my opinion, there is hope that over time, the appellant will address his problems and become a contributing member of the community.  He has not had any disciplinary offences in jail;  he works as a sweeper and has attended such programs as have been available to him.  His relationship with his girlfriend has broken down, but, as I have said, his family remains highly supportive of him. 
51Having taken all of these factors into account, including the objective seriousness of the offence and the fact that this is the third serious offence of violence committed by the appellant within a relatively short space of time, I remain of the opinion that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  Prior to the application of the discount, the sentence imposed by his Honour upon the applicant was approximately 6 years and 4 months, in circumstances where the maximum penalty was 7 years.  Notwithstanding the seriousness with which I view the appellant's offending, I consider that relative to the maximum penalty, the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive.  
52Applying the discount of 25 per cent for the early plea, the sentence at which I have arrived is 4 years and 2 months.  For the reasons given by his Honour, there should be a finding of special circumstances.  Accordingly, I propose that the appellant be sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months with an additional term of 1 year and 6 months.  As the conviction of the s 321(1)(a) count is to be quashed, the non-parole period is to commence on 11 January 2011 and to expire on 10 September 2013.
53Accordingly, the orders I propose are:
(1) Appeal against conviction of the charge under the Crimes Act 1900, s 321(1)(a) allowed;
(2) The conviction on the charge under the Crimes Act 1900, s 321(1)(a) recorded in the District Court be quashed;
(3) Pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 8A, the proceedings be continued before the Local Court at Orange on the first date available that is convenient to the Court and to the parties;
(4) Grant leave to appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the charge under the Crimes Act 1900, s 35(4);
(5) Appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the charge under the Crimes Act 1900, s 35(4) allowed;
(6) Sentence the appellant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months commencing on 11 January 2011 and expiring on 10 September 2013 and an additional term of 1 year and 6 months expiring on 10 March 2015.  The first date upon which the appellant is eligible for release is 10 September 2013.
54HIDDEN J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley JA in relation to the charge under s 321(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, and with her Honour's reasons.  
55I also agree, for the reasons expressed by Beazley JA, that the sentence for the offence of reckless wounding is manifestly excessive.  Nevertheless, like her Honour, I regard the offence as a serious one of its kind and I am satisfied that this court should intervene only to a modest extent.  That said, I consider that the reduction of sentence proposed by her Honour is inadequate.
56The effect of the orders proposed would be to reduce the sentence and non-parole period by 4 months.  In my view, a reduction of at least 6 months is called for.  That would be achieved by a starting point of 5 ½ years which, after a reduction of 25% for the plea of guilty, would produce a sentence, rounded off, of 4 years.  An appropriate non-parole period would be 2 ½ years.
57As I have said, I consider that the court should intervene at least to that extent.  It may be that a somewhat greater reduction would be appropriate.  However, as I am aware that I am in the minority on this issue, I express no concluded view about that.
58ROTHMAN J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley JA and with her Honour's reasons.
59I desire to make some additional comments on the proposed reckless wounding sentence.  Ordinarily, a reduction of 4 months in a sentence of this length, as proposed and with which I agree, would be tinkering.  However, the original sentence was fixed, bearing in mind the need to comply with the principle of totality and the sentence that was imposed in relation to Count 1.
60The sentence in Count 1 is no longer relevant and totality no longer features as an applicable principle.  Because of the orders to be made under s 8A of the Criminal Appeal Act, the possibility of a conviction under s 319 of the Crimes Act becomes problematic and renders the task in re-sentencing far more complex.
61The maximum sentence under s 319 is 14 years' imprisonment as against the maximum under s 321 of the Crimes Act, which is 10 years.  The circumstances of this particular case would not allow, it would seem, a sentencing judge to impose more for a sentence under s 319, than would be appropriate under s 321.  Moreover, in the circumstances of this case and its history, no more severe overall sentence would seem appropriate, even if the additional charge were included.
62I have opted for the re-sentencing regime proposed by Beazley JA, because I do not consider it likely that an offence will be charged under s 319, and even if it were, and a sentence were imposed, it is likely, in all the circumstances, that it would be wholly concurrent with the sentence now being imposed.

2759295,Krotiris v R [2012] NSWCCA 28,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA:    I agree with Davies J.

2ROTHMAN J:    I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Davies J in draft. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour.

3On the issue of parity, I agree with the reasons of Davies J.

4For my own part, I am not sure that a 5 percent discount adequately reflects the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty in this case, but I am not convinced one way or the other. However, I am sure that no lesser sentence than that imposed is warranted: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

5DAVIES J:  On 19 January 2011 the Applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to the offence of stealing from a dwelling house contrary to s 148 of the Crimes Act 1900. On 13 May 2011 he was sentenced by Judge Cogswell SC to a period of imprisonment of 2 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months to expire on 12 July 2012. The Sentencing Judge took into account an offence of attempted break and enter with intent to steal on a Form 1.

6The primary offence and the Form 1 offence were committed in close proximity, and were committed in company with one Andrew Schoultz. Mr Schoultz was sentenced by Judge King SC on 24 September 2009 to a period of imprisonment of 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year. Judge King took into account 2 offences on a Form 1, being the offence of attempted break and enter with intent to steal, and a further offence that the offender was in possession of a housebreaking implement without lawful excuse.

7The sole ground of appeal contained in the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was an asserted lack of parity with the sentence given to Mr Schoultz by Judge King. However, during the hearing the Applicant sought leave to add a further ground as follows:

His Honour erred in allowing only a 5% discount for the utilitarian plea of guilty.

Although this was opposed by the Crown, the Crown could not point to any prejudice if the ground was added. Accordingly, the Court granted leave.

8The Sentencing Judge found the following facts:

5.  Mr Krotiris and another man named Andrew Schoultz were in Birriga Road, Bellevue Hill, in the early hours of Tuesday, 9 December 2008; in fact it was about 4.30 in the morning. There was a security gate around a block of units in Birriga Road. The gate was about two metres high. Both of them climbed over the security gate and went down a flight of stairs to the first unit.
6.  They tried to get into one of the units. They were seen by one of the occupants who reported what had happened and Mr Krotiris and Mr Schoultz left the scene. They were heard talking by the occupants of the unit they tried to get into and they were seen looking into cars parked in a nearby block of units. The occupants of the unit that they tried to get into called the police.

7.  Not knowing that the police were on their way, Mr Krotiris and Mr Schoultz continued with their criminal escapade. They got a makeshift ladder and climbed on to the balcony of a unit in another block of units nearby. The sliding door had been left slightly open for fresh air. It was Mr Schoultz who actually got on to the balcony.

8.  He then walked through the sliding door and picked up a computer and a watch which belonged to one of the occupants. He in fact was in the bedroom of one of the occupants. She woke up and not surprisingly screamed and woke her partner who jumped out of bed and told Mr Schoultz to clear off. Mr Schoultz did just this and jumped over the balcony and discarded what he had taken.

9.  The man was heard running up Birriga Road and voices were heard saying, ""The cops, the cops are here.""

10.  The police arrived and Mr Schoultz was arrested whilst he was running away. He was wearing a sock on one hand and had a screwdriver and a latex glove as well. They then found Mr Krotiris. They found that Mr Krotiris had Mr Schoultz's phone number on Mr Krotiris' phone. Police asked Mr Krotiris what he was doing and he said, ""I was at the top of the street doing 500 steps, push-ups, 500 steps, push-ups.""

Procedural history

9The Applicant was originally charged with 3 offences as follows:

Count 1:Aggravated attempted break, enter and commit serious indictable offence;

Count 2:Attempted break, enter and commit serious indictable offence (in the alternative); and

Count 3:Enter dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence.

10Count 3 was subsequently amended to a charge of aggravated enter dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence.

11The Applicant was committed to stand trial. 

12The trial was listed in November 2009 but vacated because the Applicant changed his legal representation. It was then listed again in July 2010 but was vacated because the Applicant was sick. It was listed again in October 2010, but was vacated for a third time because a Crown witness was not available.

13It then came on for hearing on 17 January 2011. The Applicant pleaded not guilty. Judge Cogswell conducted a voir dire concerning the admissibility of certain evidence. On 18 January 2011 Judge Cogswell ruled that this evidence was admissible. On 19 January 2011 the Applicant pleaded guilty to the offence of steal from dwelling house, and consented to an offence of attempted break, enter and commit serious indictable offence being taken into account on a Form 1. 

14It is apparent that the plea of guilty on 19 January together with the placing of the other offence on the Form 1 was consented to by the Crown. How that came about was not elucidated. Nor was there any evidence of whether there had been, and if so what, negotiations about a plea prior to 19 January 2011. This absence of evidence left the Court in an unsatisfactory position given the added ground of appeal. 

15Judge Cogswell determined that the plea of guilty was at a very late stage and he only allowed a discount of a little over 5% for that plea. 

The sentence

16At the time he sentenced the Applicant Judge Cogswell had available to him the Remarks on Sentence by Judge King in respect of Mr Schoultz. I shall return to that presently.

17Judge Cogswell noted that the Applicant had a bad criminal record which included prison sentences for stealing, for possessing implements to break into a car, for having goods in custody, and for supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. He had other offences of break, enter and steal and obtain money by deception. Judge Cogswell described it is as a very bad record for a thirty-four year old man. He noted further that the offence charged was committed whilst the Applicant was on conditional liberty. 

18The Judge took into account that the Applicant was not the person who actually entered the unit - that was Mr Schoultz. His Honour also found that the offence charged fell at the lower end of the range, a finding consistent with that made by Judge King to which Judge Cogswell referred. 

19Judge Cogswell then turned to consider the Applicant's subjective circumstances. He read a psychologist's report from Tim Watson-Munro. The report confirmed evidence and other information that the Applicant had had a serious heroin habit for some years. He had been through the Drug Court and had been part of the program administered by that Court. He was successful for some time but lapsed when a woman who was pregnant with his child suffered a miscarriage. The Sentencing Judge noted that at the time of the offence charged the Applicant was in a stage of relapse. 

20At the time of the sentence the Applicant had re-established himself on the methadone program. His Honour further noted that Mr Watson-Munro described the Applicant as depressed and anxious. Mr Watson-Munro reported that the Applicant expressed considerable remorse for his behaviour which Mr Watson-Munro believed to be genuine. His Honour noted that the remorse was confirmed by the Applicant in evidence before him, and his Honour said that he took it into account. Mr Watson-Munro also noted that the Applicant was willing to undertake treatment that could be offered to him, and noted that he had begun contact with an organisation which would assist him in the process of treatment. 

21His Honour said that he regarded the appropriate penalty in all the circumstances to be 3 years in imprisonment. He discounted that by a little over 5% to impose a head sentence of 2 years and 10 months. His Honour, it may be inferred, found special circumstances, because he made specific reference to the non-parole period that would ordinarily be imposed by reason of such a head sentence and said he proposed to reduce it to a period of 18 months. 

22An issue of backdating arose because by the time of the sentence the Applicant had served some time in custody, most of which could not be attributed to the offence for which he was being sentenced. However, because his bail conditions had been reasonably onerous his Honour said that he had generously backdated the sentence to allow a period of 2 months for the time he had spent in custody although, strictly, only 16 days could be attributed to the offence for which he was being sentenced. 

Grounds of appeal

Ground 2 - 5% discount for plea of guilty

23Given that a complaint of disparity accepts that the sentence imposed on an offender cannot otherwise be challenged (Rae v R [2011] NSWCCA 211 at [60]), it is convenient to deal first with this new ground. If error is demonstrated in relation to the discount such an error may be sufficient to explain the disparity in the sentences given to the co-offenders. 
24Judge King noted that Mr Schoultz entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity. Accordingly, he gave him a 25% discount for the utility of that plea. 

25I have made mention of the difficulty in dealing with this ground of appeal because of the paucity of information concerning negotiations, if any, in relation to a plea of guilty prior to the plea being entered on 19 January 2011. It seems to me it is incumbent upon the Applicant, who argues this ground of appeal, to produce appropriate evidence to show that there was an error on the part of the Sentencing Judge in only giving a 5% discount. 

26A reading of the transcript of the sentencing hearing makes two things clear. The first is that the Sentencing Judge was aware (as might be expected) that the indictment was amended only on 19 January 2011 to charge the present offence. The second is that the only reference made by the Applicant's counsel to the guilty plea and any discount was a submission that Mr Schoultz received a benefit of an early plea by the discount he was given by Judge King. No other submission was apparently made suggesting that there should be a discount for the guilty plea by the Applicant or what discount that should be. 

27At the hearing of the appeal the Applicant's present counsel suggested that the discount ought to have been 15%. He made reference to comments by Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreed) in Sullivan v R; Skillin v R [2008] NSWCCA 296 at [15]-[17], and to what was said by Hodgson JA in R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 at [8]. 

28In Sullivan the applicants were charged with a number of offences of disposing of motor vehicles contrary to s 188 of the Crimes Act 1900. Such offences are commonly known as re-birthing of motor vehicles. The relevant history concerning the pleas is to be found in Howie J's judgment at [8]:

The matters have a long history. Both of the applicants were arrested in May 2004. The applicant Skillin admitted to police disposing of the vehicles but maintained he did not know they were stolen. The applicant Sullivan refused to be interviewed by police. They were committed for trial to the District Court on 7 April 2005. The matters were first before that court in September 2005. There were numerous adjournments while the Crown served material on the applicants and determined what charges would proceed and how the applicants would be indicted. In March 2007 a trial date of 16 July 2007 was fixed. Eventually there were successful negotiations between the applicants and the Crown resulting in the indictment of 19 July 2007 to which the applicants pleaded guilty on arraignment. 

29What seems to be suggested, although it is not made quite clear, is that the original charges differed from those contained in the indictment of 19 July 2007 to which the applicants pleaded guilty.

30The sentencing Judge in that case gave a discount of 15%, saying that the pleas involved significant utilitarian value, but she also said the ""late negotiation and entry of pleas meant that the Crown had to prepare for the trial or series of separate of trials, therefore the utilitarian value of the pleas was diminished by their being made at that stage"".

31Sullivan argued that the discount should have been at least 20%. Howie J went on to say:

[14]  ... The short answer is that this Court would not generally find that there was an error in the exercise of discretion in choosing a discount of 15 per cent rather than one of 20 per cent, in particular where the Judge gives reasons for determining the discount chosen.

[15]  The applicant seeks to obtain support from what I said in R v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291 in the following passage of my judgment and in particular the sentence I have underlined: 

[86]It does not always follow that a plea is entered at the first reasonable opportunity simply because the plea occurs after negotiations with the Crown once the offender has been committed for trial. Clearly there will be occasions where the nature of the bargain struck does indicate that the offender could not reasonably have been expected to plead guilty before the opportunity was presented to plead to some less serious charge. But that is not always so and it behoves the sentencing judge to look at the situation realistically in determining the value of the plea on the utilitarian basis. Nor is it the case that the same discount applies to all the offences for which the offender is to be sentenced and a proper exercise of discretion requires the judge to discriminate between the offences if it is necessary to do so in order to properly reflect the value of the pleas by the discount given.

After that passage I quoted from the judgment of Hodgson JA in R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 in which his Honour noted that pleas coming late in the proceedings will have less utilitarian effect and, therefore, attract a lesser discount.

[16]  I do not understand how the underlined passage of my judgment applies to the facts in this case. Clearly the applicant could have indicated a willingness to plead guilty to some charges early in the proceedings. He did not have to wait until the Crown was in a position to go to trial in order to enter into negotiations. If he chooses to wait to see what the Crown is going to do at trial then clearly the utilitarian value of the pleas is less. He knew what offences he had committed even if the Crown was not in a position to prosecute him for those matters. If the accused waits as a matter of tactics before entering negotiations with the Crown then so be it, but he does not obtain the advantage of the full utilitarian value of an early plea. 

[17]  At the hearing of the application, counsel for the applicant submitted that the Judge should have taken into account that whole history of the matter including the various charges that the Crown laid at different times during the period of the prosecution that did not find their way on to the final indictment. In my opinion none of this history changes the situation that the applicant knew what offences he had committed and what he was prepared to acknowledge whether the Crown had chosen to charge him with those offences or not. It is not unusual for persons to acknowledge to the authorities guilt of offences uncharged against them in an effort to clear the record and, as a result, be rewarded with what is known as an Ellis discount. A discount of 15 per cent was more than appropriate to meet the situation in this case. (emphasis added)

32In Dib the applicant was committed for trial on 17 December 2000 on a number of charges, one of which was that of being an accessory after the fact to murder. He and his co-accused were arraigned on 1 February 2001. The trial was listed to commence on 9 September 2002. The jury was empanelled on 11 September 2002. 
33On that day the Crown presented a further indictment against the applicant of being an accessory after the fact to the malicious wounding of the deceased with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The applicant pleaded not guilty to the more serious charge but guilty to the lesser charge, and the Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. The Sentencing Judge gave a discount for the utilitarian plea of guilty of 16.7%. The Sentencing Judge said that the discount for a plea of guilty would not be as great in a case where it involved a plea to a lesser charge as where it involved a plea to all charges brought by the Crown. 

34This Court held that so holding was an error, and said that the plea should have been treated as one made at the earliest opportunity. However, the Sentencing Judge was not therefore bound to grant a discount of 25%. Hodgson JA (with whom Barr J agreed) said:

[4]  However, the utilitarian discount is a recognition of advantages to the administration of justice that actually flow from a plea of guilty. By reason of statutory provisions applying in New South Wales, in this State it is not given merely on the basis that the offender's culpability is mitigated by demonstration of willingness to facilitate the course of justice: R v. Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300, distinguishing Cameron v. The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 382. 

[5]  If a plea is entered a long time after a person is first charged, but at a time when a lesser charge is substituted for a greater charge, the advantages to the administration of justice are less, even though the plea may have been made at the earliest opportunity. There is in any event no entitlement to a 25% discount; and the fact that in this situation there are less advantages to the administration of justice can justify a smaller discount.

[6]  This approach may mean that in some cases an offender may obtain a lower discount just because the prosecuting authorities initially brought a greater charge than that ultimately pursued, so that the delay in the plea of guilty was not the offender's fault. But this is consistent with the nature of the discount as being at least in part a recognition of practical advantages, and not merely a recognition of mitigation of culpability. 

[7]  I think the sentencing judge may also have been in error in referring to the strength of the Crown case. That can be relevant to the question of whether a plea of guilty is indicative of remorse or otherwise mitigating of culpability, but it is not relevant to the discount to be given by reason of the advantages actually flowing to the administration of justice. 

[8]  However, in my opinion, the discount given in this case, namely 16.7%, was entirely appropriate, and for that reason the first ground of appeal fails. (emphasis added)

35The Applicant points to the similarity of events in those cases where a plea was made to an amended indictment at the earliest opportunity after such indictment was presented. The Applicant argues that the discounts approved by this Court in those cases provides an indication of what is appropriate in the present case. 

36R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 was the guideline judgment in respect of discounts for pleas of guilty. Spigelman CJ (with whom Wood CJ at CL, Foster A-JA, Grove and James JJ agreed) said:

[152]  In my opinion, the appropriate range for a discount is from 10-25 percent. 

[153]  The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge.

...

[156]  Rare cases involving exceptional complexity and trial duration may justify a higher discount. In some cases no discount is appropriate at all. In some cases the ""discount"" will be reflected in a step down in the hierarchy of sentencing options.

...

[159]  It is also pertinent to state that a discount of 10-25 percent is not a range within which trial judges may exercise a discretion that will not be subject to appellate review. Appeals against severity or leniency of sentence focus on the range which is appropriate for the particular case, not on the range appropriate for pleas in the full variety of circumstances. 

[160]  The Court should adopt the following guideline applicable to offences against State laws:

...

(iii)  The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge.

37In my opinion, limited use can be made in the present case of the judgments in Sullivan v R and R v Dib. The appeal in Sullivan was an appeal involving a complaint that the discount given for the plea was too low at 15% and should have been at least 20%. The reasons given by Howie J in Sullivan demonstrate a difficulty asserting any error in the exercise of discretion where it is said that rather than a discount of 15%, 20% should have been granted. Further, Howie J's remark about the appropriateness of 15% was that it was ""more than appropriate"" to meet the situation in that case. 

38Dib was a crown appeal before double jeopardy was largely abolished, and it is not surprising that the Court was not prepared to interfere to adjust a discount in the circumstances of that case. However, the issue was whether a higher discount of 25% should have been granted. The statement about the appropriateness of a 16.7% discount must be seen in that context.

39The Applicant has further difficulties in the present case. The first is that, apart from mentioning that Judge King gave a discount for an early plea in relation to Schoulz, nothing else was put to the Sentencing Judge in the present case concerning a discount for a guilty plea. Mr O'Neil of counsel for the Applicant said that that was because the Applicant's counsel at the sentencing hearing was arguing for an intensive correction order. That is not a satisfactory explanation for failing to assist the Sentencing Judge to come to the view for which the Applicant now argues. 
40Secondly, in the absence of evidence about negotiations, if any, prior to the amendment and the guilty plea, all that is known is that the trial date was vacated on three occasions, and that the Applicant only pleaded guilty after a decision on a voir dire and before the scheduled trial actually commenced. The Court was informed that the trial was estimated to take three days to a week. Nevertheless, it had been fixed three times for trial and vacated, and the trial judge was required to hear argument and rule on a voir dire that took two days of court hearing time.

41It may be accepted that the discount was at the bottom end of the range. However, if it is assumed (as this Court must) that there were no other negotiations for a plea prior to 19 January 2011, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the value of the discount was small. Hodgson JA in Dib made it clear that the discount is not for the recognition of mitigation of culpability and that, despite a change in approach to the charges by the Crown at a late stage, the benefit to the community of a late plea is less, and justifies a lower discount. Further, this Court in Thomson recognised that in some circumstances a lower discount or no discount may be appropriate despite a plea.

42It seems to me that it was within the discretion of the Sentencing Judge to reduce the sentence by 5% for a plea which came at a late stage in the proceedings. In the absence of some evidence of an earlier offer by the Applicant to plead to the lesser charge ultimately brought, it cannot be said the Sentencing Judge's discretion miscarried.

43This ground fails.

Ground 2 - Parity

44The starting point for Mr Schoultz was 2 years 8 months. The starting point for the Applicant was 3 years. The Applicant argues that his role was the lesser of the two particularly because he did not enter the premises. The Applicant also submitted that counterbalancing the Applicant's worse record and the fact that the offences were committed whilst on conditional liberty was the second offence on Mr Schoultz's Form 1 and the subjective circumstances concerning the Applicant's addiction to heroin and his reason for relapse. 

45It can be accepted that it is desirable that co-offenders should be dealt with by the same judge where that is possible. The reasons for this are conveniently summarised in Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67 at [33]-[46]. That may not have been possible in the present case because Schoultz pleaded guilty at an early time but the Applicant did not until a very late stage.

46Nevertheless, in Rae at [68] Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed) said:

This court has observed that considerable obstacles are faced by an applicant seeking to invoke the parity principle in circumstances where the sentencing Judge was fully aware of the sentences imposed upon a co-offender and the reasons for those sentences, and indicates in the sentencing remarks why the Judge is departing from the co-offender's sentence: Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [58].

47Judge Cogswell was fully aware of the sentence imposed on Mr Schoultz. He made express reference to the different roles of the offenders in the offence charged and the Form 1 offence common to both, the plea of guilty by Mr Schoultz and the discount he received, the assessment by Judge King of the objective seriousness of the offence, and the fact that both offenders were heroin addicts and were engaging in this and other offences to feed their habits.

48The Applicant places weight on what is said to be his less culpable role in the commission of the offence in that it was Mr Schoultz who actually entered the premises. In R v Sukkar [2011] NSWCCA 140 this Court said at [36]:

Although the starting point is that the offenders were parties to the same joint criminal enterprise, and that should not be lost sight of, (Johnson v R; Moody v R at [4]), and that one should not identify the differences in the roles with any precision (R v Hoschke [2001] NSWCCA 317 at [18], R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [161], Johnson v R; Moody v R at [11]), it is always relevant to refer to the particular conduct of each such participant with a view to identifying the level of culpability for which each must be sentenced (R v JW at [161], and see Johnson v R; Moody v R at [4] and [94], R v Darwiche [2006] NSWSC 1167 at [74], R v Rick Barry Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [72] and [74]).


49The Sentencing Judge made reference to the different roles of the offenders. Given the way the offences were committed, and in circumstances where the judge regarded the offences as relatively unplanned, there was little basis to make much, if any, distinction between the co-offenders' respective roles. It cannot be said, however, that his Honour overlooked the matter.

50His Honour also considered the two other matters earlier referred to, namely, the Applicant's criminal record and his being on conditional liberty at the time of the offence under consideration. Whilst his Honour did not expressly contrast the Applicant's position in those matters with Mr Schoultz's position, he was not obliged to do so. It may reasonably be assumed that his Honour had regard to Mr Schoultz's sentence and the factors influencing it when considering matters relevant to the Applicant's sentence.

51The Applicant's criminal record was significantly worse than Mr Schoultz's record. He had served prison sentences, often for multiple offences, on no less than five separate occasions, the most recent before the date of the offence in question being only six months earlier on 11 June 2008. One of the offences for which he was imprisoned on that day was a break enter and steal offence. By contrast, Mr Schoultz had not previously served a term of imprisonment.

52The Applicant was at the time of the offence, unlike Mr Schoultz, on conditional liberty as follows:
(1)  30 April 2008 Parramatta Drug Court -

(a)  9 months suspended sentence for Larceny,

(b)  9 months suspended sentence for Drive Whilst 
Disqualified,

(c)  12 months suspended sentence for Drive Whilst 
Disqualified,

(d)  10 months suspended sentence for Obtain Money by 
Deception;

(2)  30 May 2008 Burwood Local Court -

(e)  18 months s 9 Bond for Drive Whilst Disqualified.

53The matters said to counterbalance these aggravating factors are the additional offence on Mr Schoultz's Form 1, and matters associated with the Applicant's heroin habit. 

54The additional Form 1 matter was an offence of possess housebreaking implement without lawful excuse. That implement was a screwdriver. It was found on Mr Schoultz when he was arrested for the offences for which both he and the Applicant were charged. Bearing in mind that the screwdriver appears to have been intended for use in the joint criminal enterprise involving Mr Schoultz and the Applicant, the fact that Mr Schoultz had possession of it when arrested can scarcely be seen as a counterbalancing factor in the Applicant's favour. 

55The issues relating to the Applicant's heroin habit are these. First, the Applicant points to the evidence he gave at the sentencing hearing that he was tricked into smoking heroin. A person with whom he was smoking marijuana put heroin into the marijuana without the Applicant realising it, and as result of that one incident he became addicted. Secondly, the Applicant said he was successfully on the methadone program, under the supervision of the Drug Court, when his fiance had a miscarriage of his twins a few months before the subject offence was committed. That caused his relationship with his fiance to end, and he lapsed back into using heroin again.

56His Honour heard the Applicant's evidence about these matters. He made express reference in his remarks to the fact that the Applicant lapsed because of the tragic circumstances of the miscarriage. Although his Honour did not refer to the Applicant's evidence about how he became addicted that may well have been because it was not safe to draw any conclusion from it in the absence of medical evidence that the Applicant's belief about the significance of the described incident was justified. 

57What is clear is that his Honour had due regard to the Applicant's heroin habit and the reason for his relapse. He no doubt weighed those matters with others in fixing the sentence. He regarded the Applicant's bad criminal record and his being on conditional liberty when the offences were committed seriously because he mentioned both matters on two occasions. He was not wrong to do so.

58In Rae Johnson J said:

[61]  The test for determining whether there is a legitimate sense of grievance is objective. What has to be demonstrated by an applicant is not that he or she feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the applicant's grievance is justified: R v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 at [34]; Dwayhi at [21].

...

[63]  A ground asserting disparity is concerned with such markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on co-offenders that they give rise to a genuine feeling on the part of a reasonable and impartial observer that justice has not been achieved because one offender has been unfairly treated, having regard to the sentence passed upon the other offender. What is required is a gross, marked, glaring or manifest disparity: England v R ; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[67]; Dwayhi at [23]-[24].

59Four months difference on a starting point of a sentence of 3 years could scarcely be said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance when judged objectively. That difference is neither gross, marked, glaring nor manifestly disparate. When the Applicant's criminal record and his conditional liberty at the time of the offences are additionally regarded that conclusion is comfortably confirmed.

60This ground fails.

Conclusion

61I propose the following orders:

(1)  Leave to appeal granted.
(2)  Appeal dismissed

		21 May 2012",2012-05-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759313,R v Pratten (No 9) [2012] NSWSC 1672,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: The application before the Court is an application for a directed verdict on the charges that are currently before the Court. The substantive charges allege various counts of a contravention of s 134.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (hereinafter ""the Code""), which makes it an offence for a person by deception to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from another person, where the other person is the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth entity.
	
	
	In this case it is said that the accused, Mr Pratten, by deception dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth entity, by filing a tax return, which was knowingly false, in that it did not declare all the income, earned by the accused during the years in question.
	
	
	It is unnecessary at this stage to drill down to any further detail in relation to the allegations. It is sufficient for me to state that this is not a case in which it is alleged there are false invoices, or claims for false or unexpended deductions. It is a case in which it is said by the Crown that moneys paid to the benefit of Mr Pratten was his income in the ordinary sense, and it was known to Mr Pratten at the time that the income tax returns relating to the years in question were lodged, that said income should have been declared and it was not. If all of that is accepted by the jury, the no case to answer or the directed verdict submission is an unusual one.
	
	
	Ordinarily a directed verdict is based upon the proposition that one or other element of the charge is such that it cannot be proved according to law. In that sense the no evidence test, as it is often referred to, is a test which judges commonly deal with in determining an application of this kind.
	
	
	The principles upon which a direction may be given are strict. They are confined, but the test, once satisfied, is not discretionary. It is a trial judge's duty to direct a verdict of acquittal if the evidence could not sustain a guilty verdict for the charge preferred. Most often, as earlier stated, that is based upon the proposition that there is no evidence upon which a jury, properly directed, could convict. See for example: Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 212.6.
	
	
	In dealing with whether an acquittal should be directed, the Court is required to ignore contradictory evidence unfavourable to the Crown case, and to take the Crown case at its highest, including any inferences that may arise from the evidence adduced, and I emphasize the word ""may"". It is for the jury, not the Judge, to resolve conflicting evidence, and I refer in particular to the judgment of Chief Justice Gleeson in R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 81.
	
	
	Ordinarily such an application, while described as a question of law, involves an assessment of the facts that are proved by the evidence adduced in the Crown case, and ordinarily such an application is made at the close of the Crown case.
	
	
	For obvious reasons an application of that kind cannot or is not usually made before the closure of the Crown case. Those obvious reasons include that the Crown case could alter.
	
	
	Nevertheless, it is important to stress that it is not for the trial judge to determine the issue on the basis that a jury verdict would be unreasonable, or as it was once described, unsafe and unsound. If there be evidence, even tenuous, inherently weak or vague evidence, which a jury is able to take into account and which, if accepted by the jury, would support a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury.
	
	
	It is not a matter for the trial Judge to pre-empt a potentially unreasonable verdict by a jury, but a matter for the Court of Criminal Appeal, if the verdict ultimately reached be found to be unreasonable.
	
	
	Secondly, it is insufficient for a trial judge to come to a conclusion that a reasonable hypothesis, consistent with innocence, can be formulated, since such is the foundation of an unreasonable verdict. That is ultimately a matter for the jury, and if they, in the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal, get it wrong, ultimately for the Court of Criminal Appeal, and I refer in particular to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39.
	
	
	This case, as earlier stated, is unusual. No submission is put and no application is made on the basis that the Crown has not proved an element of the offence (except as set out hereunder).
	
	
	The Court enquired of counsel as to whether such a ground were to be raised, and was informed that it would not be raised. This application for a directed verdict is one that could have been made at the time that the indictment was preferred by the Crown. The submission of the accused, in this case, is essentially that there can be on the facts alleged by the Crown no financial advantage obtained, and, therefore, no offence under s 134.2 of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	I have in the course of argument referred to two aspects of the submissions that have been put and referred to them as: firstly, the issue of the temporariness of any advantage, if there be an advantage; and, secondly, the nature of financial advantage being such that it cannot be effected in circumstances where it is the statute rather than the income tax return which determines liability to income tax. I will deal with each of those separately.
	
	
	One other matter should be stated. The accused has gone into evidence. This has been short evidence, predominantly formal, but the accused's case has closed, and this application for a directed verdict is made immediately prior to the addresses being commenced.
	
	
	The Crown takes issue with the capacity of the defence to raise the issue at this time. There is a dearth of authority on the proposition. However, it seems, from first principles, and the little authority that does exist, that the defence is entitled to make the application it now makes at any stage. Reference has been made to the judgment of his Honour Justice Hunt, as he then was, in R v Haas (1986) 22 A Crim R 299. His Honour said at page 299, after referring to the fact that the accused has already gone into evidence:
	


""In my view the accused should still be permitted to seek such a ruling immediately at the conclusion of the Crown case, notwithstanding that he has already gone into evidence during the course of that case, retaining the right to call further evidence if his application fails. It has not been argued by the Crown to the contrary.

The only consequence of the accused following the present course is that, so far as it is relevant to this issue, I must take into account that evidence put forward by the accused, as well as the evidence of the Crown witnesses, in deciding whether the Crown has made out a case for him to answer"".


	
	That of course was a circumstance where the accused's evidence, or the adducing of the particular evidence, occurred during the course of the Crown case, and not after opening a separate case.
	
	
	In a judgment of mine in the case called R v Philip Wan Por Leung (No 3) [2009] NSWSC 450 the same situation arose. Because of the unavailability of an expert witness, who was qualified by the accused, the witness was called or interposed during the middle of the Crown case. In that situation the accused, even more obviously than was the case in Haas, supra, that is, in the case before Justice Hunt, had gone into evidence and opened a case.
	
	
	The view I took in that case was that the no case submission could still be made, albeit that the no case submission was adumbrated immediately at the close of the Crown case.
	
	
	I stated as a matter of principle that the evidence adduced by the expert could be used to support the Crown case, but not to contradict it, since if it were contradictory of the Crown case, the principles embodied in a no case to answer would not have been followed, were it to be taken into account.
	
	
	While that judgment was the subject of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the question as to whether a verdict should have been directed, the Court of Criminal Appeal accepted the statement of principle as to the manner in which that question ought to be decided.
	
	
	It seems to me that, ultimately, it becomes a question of what is fair and just. If there be a question of law, which renders the charge, as a matter of law, unproved, then it matters not, subject to the ability of the Crown during the course of its own case to alter its case, when that application be made. As a matter of law, the jury cannot decide a question, which could not be before it.
	
	
	It seems to me that the preferable course is that which underpins the reasoning of his Honour Justice Hunt in Haas, supra, and the reasoning I applied inLeung (No 3), supra, and that would be to allow the accused to put the no case to answer at this point in time.
	
	
	I then deal with the substance of the application. The application arose in somewhat odd circumstances. The Court asked the parties for an indication of the kind of directions that ought to be given. In the course of the exchange of documentation in relation to that aspect, the accused raised the issue that the case itself could not be proved because of the lack of a financial advantage and urged a direction to that effect. The Court pointed out that it seemed a question of law rather than a question of fact.
	
	
	I deal with the issues, previously mentioned as the issues, relating to the temporary nature of any financial advantage, and secondly, the operation of the statute.
	
	
	In one sense every financial advantage is temporary or potentially temporary. Every financial advantage that may be sought can be remedied either by another administrative act of the Commonwealth, or by civil proceedings, if it be a party other than the Commonwealth, and perhaps civil proceedings if it be the Commonwealth. Those civil remedies can also include interest.
	
	
	The fact, if it be the fact, that the financial advantage alleged by the Crown is a short term advantage, because the Australian Taxation Office levies income tax by the issue of a default assessment, including interest, and in most circumstances penalties, does not in my view render the act incapable of being an act for a financial advantage. A temporary financial advantage, if it be a financial advantage, is still a financial advantage and remains a financial advantage for the time it remains uncorrected. The fact that it is eventually corrected is, in this sense, irrelevant and I so hold.
	
	
	The second question is a little more difficult and of greater moment. The submission made is essentially a submission based upon a proposition adumbrated by the learned authors of the Federal Criminal Law Service, Messrs Williams, Payne and McNaughton at paragraph 5A - 134.2.10 under the heading ""Obtains a Financial Advantage"". In the course of their commentary the learned authors say this:
	


""It is an open question whether the provision [being a reference to s134.2 with which Mr Pratten is charged] will extend to the making of deliberately false statements in an income tax return. Income tax is imposed by the operation of the Act although the precise amount of that is ascertained by assessment and any review decision.""

The learned authors refer to Re Mendonca; Ex parte Commissioner of Taxation (1969) 15 FLR 256.

They go on to say:

""Any amount understated will be subject to a liability to pay interest and administrative penalties. This distinguishes the position from cases such as Matthews andFountain where a person has deferred a present liability to pay a debt by writing a valueless cheque.""


	
	Mr Leighton-Daly, who appears for the accused, contrasts the provisions of s 134.2 of the Code with the provisions of s 135.1, which, at least in subsection 1 thereof, refers to a person doing anything with the intention of dishonestly obtaining a gain from a Commonwealth entity or the Commonwealth itself.
	
	
	It seems to me the fact that another provision of the Code gives rise to an offence which is easier to understand or easier to prove does not mean that s 134.2 does not also give rise to an offence. It would not be the first occasion on which the performance of one act would render a person guilty of a number of offences, some of which are more serious than others.
	
	
	Properly analysed the submission of Mr Leighton-Daly would render impossible even the obtaining of a gain within the meaning of s 135.1. It may mean therefore that the provision of s 11.1 of the Code would operate to mean a person was attempting either a 134.2 offence or a 135.1 offence, but neither of those issues arise in the present circumstances.
	
	
	The argument is an ingenious one and one which has a number of compelling aspects. However, in my view, the argument must fail. The reason it fails is because no act, on one view, relating to the Commonwealth could ever mean the obtaining of a financial advantage if the argument were correct. If one were to look at the obtaining of a pension, or a benefit or any kind of grant, all of such benefits are obtained by an application of an Act of Parliament to the objective facts in question. In this case, tax is levied on the basis of the objective income that is earned and properly calculated deducting allowable deductions and the like.
	
	
	Ultimately the submission of the defence is this: that, because the Commonwealth has (assuming as I must that the Commonwealth has proved its case) proved that Mr Pratten has received income that he did not declare and rectified the situation, no financial advantage is gained. The necessary inference, assuming again that the Commonwealth has proved its case otherwise, from the acts that have been carried out, is that it was intended the Commonwealth would act permanently on the basis of the tax return that was filed. I do not at this point deal with tax amendments and the details, but dealing with it from a hypothetical perspective, the fact that the Commonwealth ultimately takes a view that the objective facts are otherwise than that which have been declared, and the fact they have a capacity to do that, does not render the filing of a return and the obtaining of a tax assessment that is more favourable to the taxpayer than would otherwise be the case anything other than the obtaining of a financial advantage.
	
	
	In Mendonca, Gibbs J (then sitting as Federal Court of Bankruptcy) dealt with the effect of a tax assessment on bankruptcy and vice versa. The judgment of his Honour turns on whether the tax debts were in existence at the date of the bankruptcy. His Honour held that although tax ""was owing"" under the statutes for the years in question, since no assessment issued, the ""debt"" was neither liquidated nor payable and, therefore, could not form the basis for a creditor's petition.
	
	
	The question before Gibbs J was fundamentally different to the issue pressed by the accused in these proceedings. The fact that the statute renders tax owing, even though no assessment has issued, does not mean that a person cannot deceive the Commonwealth as to the objective facts necessary to finalize an assessment. It is the finalization of the assessment that renders the tax debt payable and the reduction of that which is payable is a financial advantage, which, if obtained dishonestly and by deception, gives rise to the offence.
	
	
	I agree with the analysis of Gray J in Matthews v Fountain [1982] VR 1045 at [1049]. His Honour was dealing with the presentation of a valueless cheque by a person who could not otherwise pay the debt. His Honour said:
	


""[1049] In my opinion, however ""penniless"" a person may be, he derives a financial advantage by evading an antecedent debt, for however short a period. In one sense it can be said that he obtains ""credit"" or time to pay. The proffering of a valueless cheque is equivalent to proffering counterfeit bank notes. He fobs off the creditor and gains time to pay. The fact that he may, in a given case, be unable to pay is, in my opinion irrelevant. He is relieved for the time being of being harried by the creditor by legal proceedings or otherwise. If the observations of Widgery, L.J. are valid, they would apply equally to the case of a man who, although having the means to pay, has resolved not to do so. It could be said that such a person has not evaded the debt or obtained any financial advantage by his deception. In this connection, one may ask rhetorically - ""Why is the valueless cheque proffered?"" It is clearly intended to confer some advantage upon the person practicing the deception. Equally clearly, in my opinion it is a financial advantage.

The matter can be looked at another way. By proffering a valueless cheque, the profferor is falsely representing that it is a valid cheque. If the representation had been true, the profferor is would lose the amount of the cheque, upon its presentation. In the case of the false representation he loses nothing upon the presentation of the cheque. He thus obtains a financial advantage by reason of the deception.""


	
	It is accurate to assert, as does the accused, that tax is owing on the objectively ascertained amount of income. But it does not follow that a ""dishonest deception"" that misleads the ATO as to the objective facts is incapable of giving rise to a financial advantage. The advantage may be temporary, because the real facts are discovered, but it is still an advantage.
	
	
	Moreover, notwithstanding the view expressed by the learned authors of the Service, pensions, benefits, bounties and grants are, in other than quite exceptional cases, based upon either objective circumstance or the administrative decision-maker's understanding or satisfaction as to the existence of circumstances. The distinction between tax, on the one hand, and a pension, on the other, does not withstand scrutiny.
	
	
	I consider that the filing of a tax return, especially in circumstances where the Act or Statutory schemes require self-assessment, means that a financial advantage is obtained by deception, if a person were dishonest to understate the assessable income earned during any financial year.
	
	
	For those reasons I reject the current application for a directed verdict.

2759334,Heshmati v R [2012] NSWDC 143,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR: This case is an appeal from the Local Court. Dr Bijan Heshmati was found guilty by a magistrate of signing a declaration contained in a statement filed under the Bankruptcy Act which Dr Heshmati knew to be false. That is an offence contrary to s267(2) of the Bankruptcy Act. The particular statement which was said to be untrue, was made when Dr Heshmati indicated (by crossing a box with 'no' written next to it), the answer 'no' to this question;

""Have you sold, transferred or given away any assets worth more than a thousand dollars in the last five years?""

2Evidence in the Local Court was called on the prosecution side and Dr Heshmati gave evidence. When the appeal was heard in this Court he tendered some further documents, pursuant to a grant of leave that had been granted to him earlier by a different judge. He sought to give further evidence but I refused that application. 

3There is no doubt that in August 2006, well within the five years prior to Dr Heshmati signing the statement of affairs, he had transferred assets worth more than a thousand dollars. The prosecution focused on one particular transaction. On 29 August 2006, Dr Heshmati, obtained a bank cheque for $150,000 from the ANZ bank, utilising money that he had held in a premium cash management account. (I note in passing, both sides have drawn my attention to this, that that particular account was not listed as an account held by Dr Heshmati, as it should have been at question 23 of the statement of affairs). As I say, the appellant obtained a bank cheque for $150,000 which he transferred to his wife. He says that this was for two reasons, one, to pay a debt that he owed his wife in these circumstances: When he married his wife, he agreed to pay her a total of 100 Iranian Azadi gold coins, upon his wife's request. A photocopy of what is apparently a marriage certificate together with an authorised translation was tendered as fresh evidence on this appeal. 

4It is apparent according to that translation, there is on the marriage certificate, this appearing;

""The couple agreed on a marriage portion of a total of 100 Iranian Azadi gold coins which is payable by the groom upon the request of the bride"".

5The appellant says that $75,000 of that $150,000 bank cheque, was in payment of the debt to his wife, as she had requested payment pursuant to the agreement made upon marriage and that they agreed between them, since Iranian Azadi gold coins are not as freely available as Australian dollars, that the debt would be settled by payment of that $75,000. The remainder of the $150,000 was according to Dr Heshmati, used to pay his wife's living expenses in advance, in anticipation of the doctor leaving Australia. After he changed his mind in the next few days, and decided to stay in Australia, thus obviating the need for his wife to have that $75,000, it was apparently transferred back to him, and he then gambled it away.

6So the prosecution in the Local Court and here, is based on that $150,000 bank cheque. The prosecution says that represents the appellant transferring assets worth much more than a thousand dollars, in the five years prior to the statement of affairs being signed by the appellant.

7I gather that Dr Heshmati agrees now that he should have ticked the 'yes' box in those circumstances. But of course it is not enough for the prosecution to prove that the answer to question 33 is wrong. The prosecution has to prove the relevant mental element, which is that the appellant knew that it was wrong to tick the 'no' box when he did so, and it is in these circumstances that I look closely at what was apparently going through Dr Heshmati's mind when he made the statement of affairs. 

8He spoke about his state of mind at the time being extremely distressed and disordered. One thing I can work out from the material before me is that Dr Heshmati was gambling heavily. He had failed in his attempt to become accepted into a college appropriate to his medical speciality and was in those circumstances, planning to go away. Although some of what I have just outlined occurred before the money was transferred, the evidence would tend to suggest that Dr Heshmati continued to be distracted and disordered at the time he filled in the relevant form and indeed, he says, the failure to include any bank accounts at all in answer to question 23, is not evidence of dishonesty, but further evidence of that state of mind. Thus says Dr Heshmati, when he came to look at question 33, in a very lengthy document, he did not immediately consider that by paying off a debt to his wife, and prepaying her expenses, he was selling, transferring or giving away any assets. It is his submission that the question is unclear and that he misunderstood it. He did not consider that by paying a debt, he was doing anything in relation to an asset of his, all he says he was doing was paying a debt. 

9In response the prosecution says, well if he was paying a debt, he should have answered 'yes' to question 36. But that question begins as a result of pressure for payment from creditors. Have you done certain things? The opening words are important. The evidence would tend to suggest that Dr Heshmati's wife asked for payment of the marriage debt. There is no evidence that she put pressure on him and so I can draw no conclusion favourable to the Crown, from the failure of Dr Heshmati to answer 'yes' and then provide details in relation to question 36. 

10If you look at question 33 closely, it is apparent that it covers the situation where a person uses money in a bank account to pay off a debt worth more than a thousand dollars. So if a person has a credit card bill of more than a thousand dollars and transfers money from a bank account in credit to the credit card provider, that should be recorded in question 33. But there are only six lines given for details to be provided. I might have thought that if I had to record every time in the last five years I have paid a debt of more than a thousand dollars, more space would be allocated. 

11Of course in an ideal world, everyone filling in a statement of affairs would think carefully about every single question that is asked of them and if that had been done, it is possible, I do not say it is likely but it is possible, that Dr Heshmati might have realised that he should have ticked the answer 'yes'. But in circumstances where I consider that there are indications in the form itself, that transferring assets in order to pay a debt, is not included in question 33, that is a significant matter in assessing whether the prosecution has proved, beyond reasonable doubt I emphasise, that Dr Heshmati knew that the declaration was false. 

12I pause here to note that other aspect of the documents given to a person who has been made bankrupt, are unnecessarily complex. Tendered in the Local Court and then tendered to me, is a document headed, ""Information About Being a Bankrupt"". It contains many extracts of Commonwealth legislation including such helpful things as, 

""Note a defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection 1(A) see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code"".

13I have on other occasions commented about the difference between the way Commonwealth Parliamentary Counsel drafts legislation, and the way in which New South Wales Parliamentary Counsel drafts legislation. Those comments have not been favourable to the Commonwealth. It appears that some closer consideration could be given to documents given to a bankrupt, in order to ensure that that person can understand the person's obligations and liabilities. 

14I will give another small example. Every time a number is mentioned it is both written out and put in numerals. Lawyers are used to reading that but one wonders why it is necessary to include such obvious impediments to a clear understanding in documents which are supposed to be understandable by the man in the street, even the doctor in the street. 

15Question 33 could have asked very simply, have you transferred money in excess of a thousand dollars in the last five years in any circumstances whatsoever. I appreciate that even the word 'whatsoever' could be improved upon, but the point that I wish to make is that it is necessary to give careful consideration to the meaning of the question, in order to understand that regular, even automatic, payment of debts, worth more than a thousand dollars, requires disclosure. 

16In those circumstances I consider whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt, the mental element of this offence. 

17Now I put to one side almost completely, the circumstance that Dr Heshmati's first language is not English. He addressed me eloquently and understood most of the legal concepts that I was speaking to him about. He appeared unrepresented despite acknowledging that this might not be such a good idea but I was able to converse with him and confirm that he understood some of the things I was saying to him by asking him to repeat them back to me. So I can put to one side any question of language being a factor which might tend to explain why Dr Heshmati has answered question 33 inaccurately. But I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dr Heshmati did not make the mistake that I identified earlier, that is in thinking that the question was not asking questions about the payment of debts. It is always a difficult thing to prove a person's state of mind beyond reasonable doubt and in circumstances where Dr Heshmati has explained why he considered that the proper answer to the question was ""no"", and where I am satisfied that it is at least reasonably possible that misunderstanding arose, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Dr Heshmati was aware and thus knew, that the statement he made, the subject of these proceedings was false.

18The appeal is therefore allowed and the conviction is quashed.

1ALLSOP P: I agree with Hoeben JA.

2HOEBEN JA:
Offences and sentence
The applicant stood for sentence on 12 November 2010 before Charteris DCJ in the Sydney District Court for the following offences:

(i) That he between 3pm on 10 May 2009 and 8.40am on 11 May 2009 at Wollongong did break and enter the business premises ""Madsens Camera House and Imaging"" and then in the said business premises did commit a serious indictable offence, to wit, stealing in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, he was in company with another person who is unknown.

This offence is contrary to s112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and has a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.

(ii) That he between 11pm and 11.30pm on 12 May 2009 at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales did assault Anna Berry with intent to rob her. 

This offence is contrary to s94 of the Crimes Act 1900 and has a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.

(iii) That he between 5.33am and 6.43am on 13 May 2009 at Kings Cross in the State of New South Wales did rob Samantha Barlow of certain property and immediately before did inflict grievous bodily harm upon the said Samantha Barlow whilst armed with an offensive instrument, to wit, a house brick.

This offence is contrary to s98 of the Crimes Act and has a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.

3On 16 December 2010 his Honour sentenced the applicant as follows:

Count 1: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to commence 14 August 2009 and expire 13 February 2012, with a balance of term of 1 year to expire 13 February 2013.

Count 2: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years to commence 14 August 2011 and expire 13 August 2015, with a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months to expire on 13 November 2016.

Count 3: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years and 6 months to commence 14 November 2013 and to expire 13 May 2025, with a balance of term of 5 years and 3 months to expire on 13 August 2030.

4The aggregate sentence was one of 21 years, with a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months. His Honour did not find special circumstances.

5The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the severity of those sentences on the following grounds:

Ground 1: The sentence imposed for the break, enter and steal was manifestly excessive.

Ground 2: The sentence imposed for the assault with intent to rob was manifestly excessive.

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in finding the offence of aggravated robbery while armed causing grievous bodily harm in the ""worst case"" category of offences.

Ground 4: The sentence imposed for the aggravated robbery was manifestly excessive.

Ground 5: The learned judge erred in his assessment of totality resulting in an overall sentence which was manifestly excessive.

Factual background to offences

6Agreed Facts were placed before the court. In relation to count 1 an alarm was activated in a business known as ""Madsens Cameras and Imaging"" in Crown Street, Wollongong a little after midnight on Sunday, 10 May 2009. On investigation it was discovered that entry had been gained by forcing open a window to an adjacent building. The offender had then dropped through the roof and forced entry by kicking through a timber and plaster dividing wall providing access to the rear stairs. Goods and money to the value of approximately $5,500 were removed from the premises.

7On 18 June 2009 the applicant made admissions in relation to this offence. He said that he wanted to clear up outstanding matters. He fully participated in an electronically recorded interview and described the method of entry. He was accompanied by another male person at the time of the offence, whom he did not identify. He said that the goods which were stolen were sold to enable him to buy heroin. 

8In relation to count 2, between 11pm and 11.30pm on 12 May 2009 the victim was walking north on Forbes Street, Darlinghurst. As she approached the intersection of Forbes Street and Montclair Lane, she noticed the applicant walking a short distance behind her. When the victims had passed Montclair Lane, the applicant approached her from behind and placed both his hands over her mouth, grabbing her and preventing her from screaming. The victim fell to her knees as she pushed away from the applicant. She started screaming very loudly thrashing her body, arms and the two bags she was carrying. The applicant ran away. These events were witnessed.

9A short time after 11.30pm, the applicant spoke to a Ms Walsh and said ""I just tried to rob a girl. I tried to put my hand over her mouth and she fought me off and I ran off"". At this time Ms Walsh noticed that the applicant had a big rock about 10cms in width in his hand. The applicant said ""I'm gonna smash someone's jaw in and steal their bag"". The applicant then walked off. 

10In relation to count 3, the victim, Ms Barlow, was a sergeant of police attached to the Traffic Office at the Kings Cross Police Station. She was wearing civilian clothes at the time of the offence. At about 5.30am on 13 May 2009 she was walking to the Kings Cross Police Station to commence work. She was carrying two bags, a pink Enviro bag and a multi-coloured shoulder bag. The applicant was in Arthur Park at the time.

11The applicant picked up a rock from the garden bed in the park. In his interview he said ""I picked up the rock to threaten her with it"". He said that he was ""desperate for money"" and had ""tried earlier to get a lady's handbag"".

12The applicant approached Ms Barlow with the rock by his right side so that she could not see it. He asked her for the time. She stopped and as she turned, he struck her at least twice to the face with the rock in his right hand. She fell to the ground on her back still holding the two bags. The applicant said that he struck her at least two more times to the back of the head to make her release the bags. The applicant said that he ""hit her twice before she fell to the ground. Hit her twice on the ground. Then dragged her up here"".

13Medical reports indicated that the victim sustained blunt force head injuries with multiple lacerations to the scalp and forehead. She also suffered defensive wounds to her right hand.

14Ms Barlow lay on the ground unconscious. The applicant stated that he dragged her further into the park ""so no-one could see her"". A large pool of blood in the park confirmed that statement. During the struggle, items had fallen from her bag, including a New South Wales Police shirt. The applicant said that he put the shirt over the victim's face so that he could not see her. He said that he was ""thinking I am dead, I have just killed a police woman. I thought she was dead I thought I'd killed her"".

15The applicant collected the two bags and the property that had fallen out of the bags, including the NSW Police shirt, and wrapped this in his jacket which he held in front of him. He left Ms Barlow lying in the grass. He said that he ""did not check on her condition because he thought she was dead"". When he was about 100 metres from the park, the applicant searched the two bags. He kept her purse, her mobile phone and the shoulder bag. He tried to hide the other bag and items from it which he did not want. When the police subsequently found the pink Enviro bag, they also found a piece of brick with traces of blood and hair embedded and a blood soaked NSW Police shirt.

16Ms Barlow was discovered by patrolling police. Her hair and face were covered in blood and there was a large laceration over her right eye. She appeared dazed and could not immediately recognise any of the police, although she worked with them. She was able to recall her name but could not recall what had happened to her.

17On admission to hospital, Ms Barlow was found to be suffering from multiple scalp and forehead lacerations, multiple depressed fractures to the right occipital skull and right hand lacerations with an associated compound fracture of the right index finger tip and a closed fracture of the right middle finger. She had a minor avulsion fracture to the right little finger and facial fractures. She had suffered significant blood loss. She was placed into an induced coma and received emergency surgery to remove part of her skull and relieve pressure on the brain. A metal plate was inserted in her skull and metal fixateurs were attached to her right hand.

18The applicant was arrested on 14 May 2009 at the Dapto Railway Station. He was taken to Port Kembla Police Station and admitted to attacking the victim and hitting her to the head a number of times with a rock. After the interview he took part in a video walk-through with the police. He showed where he had discarded the victim's mobile phone.

19As a result of the attack, Ms Barlow suffered a significant brain injury. As of July 2010, she has been left with continuing thoracic and lumbar pain and an obvious parietal deformity. She has suffered a permanent loss of her sense of taste and smell. The rehabilitation process was lengthy and painful and is continuing. The brain injury which she suffered put her at risk of developing treatment resistant psychiatric symptoms. She was more vulnerable to organic personality changes and dementia during the ageing process.

20From a psychological/psychiatric point of view, Ms Barlow has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder of moderate severity and a major depression disorder. These conditions, together with the brain injury, have produced disabilities such as lowered concentration, short-term memory loss, distraction by PTSD thoughts and images, and reduced information processing capacity. Although protected by her quite robust and stoic premorbid personality, she now carries disabilities regarding her self-image with bouts of low confidence and personal vulnerability. 

Applicant's criminal record

21In order to understand his Honour's remarks on sentence, it is necessary to set out the applicant's criminal record in some detail. The applicant has an extensive criminal history covering more than 20 years. He first appeared in the Children's Court in June 1982 (aged 12) for an offence of malicious injury. Between then and May 1983 he committed 13 further offences (10 break and enter, 1 malicious injury and 2 stealing). In 1984 he was committed to an institution for offences of stealing and absconding. In August 1984 he was convicted of 12 offences (5 break enter and steal, 5 stealing and 1 each of malicious injury and take and use conveyance). In November 1984 he was dealt with for a range of offences including an offence of stealing a motor vehicle and two of break enter and steal. 

22During 1985 he was convicted of three counts of being carried in a stolen car and for stealing money. In August 1985 he was convicted of offences of break enter and steal, 4 counts of stealing a car, 3 of being carried in a stolen car and 1 of maliciously setting fire to a car. During 1986 he was committed to an institution for 2 years for an assault and rob and separately for 6 months for offences of malicious injury and absconding. In early 1987 he was convicted of 4 counts of assault, a count of stealing and a count of malicious injury. .

23After turning 18, the same pattern continued. In 1988 and August 1992 he was convicted of the offences of malicious injury, 4 counts of using a car without the owner's consent, assault, malicious damage, goods in custody, escaping lawful custody, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and administering a prohibited drug. He served his first term of imprisonment in 1992.

24Between 1993 and 1998 he was convicted of stealing, driving while his licence was cancelled, failing to stop after an accident, driving in a manner dangerous, breaching an apprehended violence order, malicious damage, being armed with intent to steal and contravening an AVO. In 1998 he served a further term of imprisonment.

25In February 1999 he was sentenced in the Wollongong District Court for maliciously wounding a female on 16 November 1997. This involved punching a former partner, threatening her with a kitchen knife and then stabbing at her so as to slice a finger. He was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years. He was released to parole on 1 July 1999.

26Between May 2000 and August 2001 the applicant resided in Queensland where he committed offences, including one of burglary, and appeared before a magistrate's court on seven occasions. He served a further term of imprisonment from which he was released to parole on 7 May 2001.

27In 2002 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for destroying or damaging property and was released to parole in September 2002. In 2003 the applicant received a gaol sentence for possessing housebreaking instruments and for three counts of goods in custody. In early 2004 he was sentenced to imprisonment for two break, enter and steal offences. 

28In November 2004 he was sentenced in the District Court for an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on a woman without provocation. Having engaged the victim in conversation, he approached her from behind, pushed her to her knees and then struck the back of her head six times with a blunt object. He struck a further three blows after the victim had put her hands to her head. The victim's injuries included a substantial laceration to her head, grazing and bruising to her head. She suffered multiple fractures to her fingers and knuckles. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 2 years.

29On 25 May 2006 the applicant was released to parole but on 8 June 2006 parole was revoked and the applicant served the balance of the prison term until 27 January 2008.

30On 21 March 2008 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court for an offence of break enter and steal. The sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 1 year.

31The applicant was released to parole on 18 April 2009 and committed the first of these offences on 14 May 2009. His parole was revoked on 8 May 2009 for reasons unrelated to these offences and it was recommended that he serve the balance of the sentence, which was due to expire on 28 April 2010.

Remarks on sentence

32The applicant did not give evidence. He relied on two psychological reports by Dr Christine Gillies of March 2008 and 9 November 2010. The earlier report was prepared for the sentencing proceedings for the offence of break enter and steal for which the applicant was sentenced in March 2008. The second report was prepared for the matters now before the Court.

33Having reviewed the facts relating to the offences, his Honour had regard to the applicant's subjective case. His Honour noted that the applicant was of Aboriginal descent and had been born in 1969. He had a difficult home life and had left home at an early age. At the time of the commission of the offences, he was almost 40 years of age. His Honour characterised the applicant's criminal record as an appalling one, with an extensive history of dishonesty and violence. His Honour then set out salient parts of that criminal record.

34His Honour had regard to the extensive nature of the injuries suffered by Ms Barlow, the treatment which she had received and the continuing disabilities, both physical and mental, from which she continued to suffer. His Honour referred particularly to the photographs, which showed the extent of the surgery to her head.

35His Honour noted that the applicant had been released to parole on 18 April and that two days following his release, his parole orders and requirements were explained to him. Referrals were arranged for drug counselling and assessment, as well as individual counselling including a referral to the Aboriginal Client Service Officer in the Community Compliance Group. A home visit by Probation and Parole officers was arranged for 5 May. The applicant did not attend any of the counselling sessions which had been arranged for him, nor was he home on 5 May when the scheduled visit by Probation and Parole personnel took place. His Honour concluded that from the time of his release on parole, the applicant had no regard for the obligations created thereby. 

36His Honour was sceptical of the conclusions arrived at by Dr Gillies in her two reports. In the March 2008 report, Dr Gillies had observed ""He pointed out he was careful not to hurt anyone physically when stealing to obtain money for drugs"". Later in the report, Dr Gillies said:

""He spoke in a manner and used vocabulary for describing his psychosocial history that made it clear that he had spoken to other people with psychological knowledge about his past. In fact his knowledge of psychological terms was quite extensive. He generally had an extensive vocabulary far beyond what is to be expected in an early school leaver.""

37Dr Gillies set out issues which had arisen because of his Aboriginal heritage. She was told that he had a difficult upbringing and was raised by his mother and stepfather. He said that by age 12 his home situation was ""totally unbearable"" so that he left. He then lived on the streets of Wollongong and began committing offences to support himself. He said that in due course he was committed to a boys' home. The applicant told Dr Gillies that he had abused alcohol and illicit drugs from an early age.

38In the first report, Dr Gillies concluded that the applicant was an habitual offender. She noted that he had a history of not sticking to commitments that he had made. Nevertheless, she thought that psychologically the applicant had reached a ""make or break"" time. She said:

""He has reached a critical juncture where he could place himself on an alternative pathway. He wants to change and he has already stopped using drugs.""

39In the second report, Dr Gillies repeated the history she had earlier recorded and set out what she had been told by the applicant concerning his movements in the gaol system before he was released on parole. He complained that he had been moved around so much that he had lost contact with his counsellors and had ended up in Junee with an Aboriginal gang of inmates who had encouraged him to use illegal drugs. The applicant told her that there were other courses he wished to undertake within the prison system which had been denied to him. He described the offences and expressed regret for his attack upon the victim. On the basis of that history, Dr Gillies was very critical of the absence of adequate support for the applicant when he was released to parole.

40Having read the reports and being aware of the applicant's criminal history, his Honour set out the following conclusions:

""... she seems to be completely accepting of the history given to her by the offender. She said he was at a crossroads in 2008 or to use her words ""make or break time"". There is an aspect of her being somewhat of an apologist for the offender in her second
report. In my view her report places far too much criticism on the alleged shortcomings of rehabilitation offered to him on his release. The fact of the matter is, and the experience of courts overwhelmingly is, that some individuals make a decision to turn their lives around; they make serious attempts to rid themselves of addiction and become worthwhile members of the community. This offender in my view has been somewhat manipulative in the history he has given Dr Gillies. I am very cautious about accepting her opinion. It is my view that any rehabilitation must first start with the offender. There is no magic bullet, no magical application of therapy or counselling which will turn an unwilling offender's life around. I am satisfied on the material that is before me that this offender has not made the decision to turn his life around. Whether he ever chooses to do so I do not know. I accept that he is intelligent enough and manipulative enough to express the appropriate words to encourage in others some optimism that he will embrace a new approach to life. But in my view one ought to look at his actions more than his words and his actions are not consistent with a person who is wishing to turn his life around."" (ROS 16.3)

41Although the applicant did not give evidence, and accordingly had not confirmed the histories in the psychological reports, his Honour gave considerable weight to the fact that by his actions the applicant co-operated with the police. He had admitted the attack upon Ms Barlow, willingly provided a statement and agreed to a walk-through interview. His Honour considered that those matters were consistent with a genuine regret for the commission of the attack upon Ms Barlow.

42His Honour assessed the attack upon Ms Barlow as being in the worst category of offences of that kind. His Honour took into account the aggravating matters of the use of a rock and the extensive injuries suffered by the victim. His Honour also had regard to matters individual to the applicant, which would operate to place any penalty imposed within the upper level of the range of penalties for offences of that kind. His Honour took into account the applicant's very bad criminal record (Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 and R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566). His Honour also took into account that the applicant was on parole at the time of the commission of this offence. By way of mitigation, because of his early plea of guilty and co-operation with authorities, his Honour allowed him a discount of 30 percent.

43In passing sentence, his Honour declined to find special circumstances. In that regard his Honour concluded that there was no point in providing a long period of parole since in the past the applicant had consistently ignored parole supervision.

44His Honour assessed the offence in count 2 to be in the middle range of criminality for offences of that kind. As before, he took into account the applicant's criminal record and the fact that he was on parole. For the reasons already indicated, his Honour allowed a discount of 30 percent.

45His Honour assessed the offence in count 1 to be within the middle range of seriousness. His Honour considered that the applicant's co-operation with the authorities in that matter was considerable since they were unaware of his participation in the offence. Taking that into account and his plea of guilty, his Honour allowed a total discount of 50 percent in the applicant's favour.

46On the question of totality, his Honour took into account the purposes of sentencing:

""But in relation to each of the offences of course I do not lose sight of the purposes of sentencing. I must ensure that this offender is adequately punished. I must prevent crime by deterring him and others from committing similar offences. I must protect our community from this offender. The Parliament also requires that I denounce his conduct and I recognised the harm done to the individual victims and to our community. I must also promote his rehabilitation. All of those purposes apply in relation to my sentencing of the offender. As regards Ms Barlow I can observe that the behaviour is so appalling that I must give greater weight to the protection of our community from this offender than perhaps other purposes of sentencing. I have sought to give weight to each of them."" (ROS 20.5)

47In order to achieve those purposes, his Honour partly accumulated each sentence.

Ground of Appeal 1: The sentence imposed for the break enter and steal was manifestly excessive.

48The applicant submitted that when one took account of the 50 percent discount, the notional starting point for his Honour's sentence was 7 years. He submitted that the objective circumstances of the offence did not justify such a high starting point. The offence was in many respects unremarkable and the circumstance of aggravation, i.e. being in company, was a matter unknown to the victim. There was no gratuitous damage to property and the amount stolen was relatively small. The offence was not committed in a person's home nor did it involve confronting a person in its execution.

49By reference to sentencing statistics, the applicant submitted that a starting point of 7 years would indicate a sentence which fell within the top 2 percent of sentences imposed for this offence. He submitted that the objective circumstances of the offence did not warrant a sentence at the top of the range.

50By reference to the aggravating factors identified by his Honour, i.e. that he was on parole and his criminal record, the applicant submitted that 17 of the 20 entries for break and enter offences on his record, occurred when he was a juvenile. The applicant submitted that his Honour had wrongly applied Veen (No 2) and McNaughton in that these matters were not matters of aggravation. In summary, the applicant submitted that 7 years was not a proportionate sentence reflecting the objective ""mid-range"" seriousness of the offence.

51The reliance on statistics in relation to this offence is unhelpful. The applicant is comparing the notional sentence of 7 years with actual sentences imposed, i.e. sentences after any discount has been applied. Accordingly, no valid comparison is possible. In addition, there are the other limitations associated with statistics set out most recently in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 243 FLR 28 at [303] - [305] and Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [53] - [54]. 

52Moreover, the objective circumstances of the offence were not insubstantial. The property loss was over $5,500 which does not include the damage caused to the premises. The fact that the premises where the offence took place comprised a business which traded in goods which were clearly in demand and could be quickly exchanged for cash is indicative of some planning. Importantly, as his Honour noted, the offence was committed within three weeks of the applicant being released to parole after his conviction for an identical offence.

53Those considerations determined the upper boundary of the sentencing range available to his Honour, which in the exercise of his wide sentencing discretion he determined to be 7 years. It was then open to his Honour within that upper boundary to use the applicant's prior criminal record with its implications as to retribution, deterrence and the protection of society to determine the final sentence and in particular the non-parole period.

54In relation to grounds of appeal raising ""manifest excess"", the plurality in Hili said: 

""59 ... And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong, appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"". Rather, as the plurality went on to say in Wong, ""intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"". But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition. And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that ""the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error"".""

55The choice of 7 years as a starting point for the head sentence, having regard to the objective circumstances of this offence, was well within his Honour's sentencing discretion. Thereafter, his Honour was entitled to place considerable weight upon the applicant's criminal record to determine where within that range the offence fell and to determine that the offence merited more serious punishment than if it were looked at in isolation.

56This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 2: The sentence imposed for the assault with intent to rob was manifestly excessive.

57The applicant submitted that once the 30 percent discount was taken into account, his Honour's starting point for the head sentence in relation to this offence was 7 years and 6 months. The applicant noted that his Honour found that the offence fell within the mid-range of criminality for offences of that kind. By reference to the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346, which he acknowledged was not directly comparable, the applicant submitted that it was clear that his Honour's start point was outside the appropriate sentencing range. The range suggested in Henry was 4 to 5 years imprisonment. 

58The range suggested in Henry is not entirely irrelevant to the circumstances of this offence. With the exception of the first factor, i.e. a young offender with no, or little criminal history, the other factors in Henry favoured the applicant. There was no weapon used, there was a limited degree of planning, there was limited actual violence, no amount of money was taken and there was a plea of guilty. 

59As the above analysis demonstrates, the objective circumstances of the offence in count 2, even allowing for the aggravating factor of the offence having been committed while on parole, would not justify a start point as high as 7 years and 6 months. While the applicant's criminal record is an aggravating circumstance, its application is limited as set out in Veen and McNaughton in that the upper boundary is fixed by the objective circumstances. In this case, an upper boundary of 7 ½ years is simply too high.

60The reasoning behind such a conclusion cannot be expressed in more detail. As was said in Hili:

""60 ... No doubt, as the Court went on to say, manifest error ""arises because the sentence imposed is out of the range of sentences that could have been imposed and therefore there must have been error, even though it is impossible to identify it"". But what reveals manifest excess, or inadequacy, of sentence is consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence. The references made by the Court of Criminal Appeal to the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of each offender were, therefore, important elements in the reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal.""

61I am satisfied that the sentence imposed for the assault with intent to rob was manifestly excessive and because of the requirements of totality, this will require that the applicant be re-sentenced.

Ground of Appeal 3: The sentencing judge erred in finding the offence of aggravated robbery while armed, causing grievous bodily harm in the ""worst case category"" of offences.

Ground of Appeal 4: The sentence imposed for the aggravated robbery was manifestly excessive.

62The applicant submitted that the notional starting point for the sentence imposed for count 3 was only 1 month short of imprisonment for 24 years for an offence which carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The applicant submitted that the objective seriousness of the offence, although high, would not place it into the worst case category and therefore his Honour's notional starting point for the sentence revealed error. The applicant relied upon the observation in Regina v Twala (NSWCCA, unreported, 4 November 1994):

""However in order to characterise any cases being in the worst category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)"". (Badgery-Parker J at p 7.)

63The applicant submitted that by reference to the objective circumstances of the offence, it was ""recognisably"" outside the worst case category. The applicant submitted that there was no gratuitous violence, the victim was not deprived of her liberty in furtherance of the offence, nor was the attack prolonged in any way. The planning of the offence was limited and done in circumstances where the applicant's state of mind was affected by his desperation for drugs. The applicant armed himself with a rock, being an object notably less dangerous than weapons used in comparative cases. The amount of property stolen was relatively small and the applicant acted alone. The applicant submitted that, but for the injuries sustained by Ms Barlow, the offence would be considered in the mid-range of seriousness for offences of its nature. The applicant did accept that the serious injuries sustained justified the placement of the offence above the mid-range of seriousness, but not into the worst case category.

64The applicant referred the Court to two cases in support of his submissions. In R v El-Andouri [2004] NSWCCA 178 the offender robbed an employee of a service station while he was carrying in his car the bank bag containing an amount of $11,855. The robbery was premeditated and executed by the offender and his co-offender by deliberately ramming the victim's car. The victim was violently assaulted and left for dead on the side of the road. He was on a life support machine, remaining in a coma for some months. The medical evidence indicated that fragments of his skull were broken off inside the skull cavity, he sustained a severe closed head injury and a right skull fracture. The victim was left with permanent brain damage and was largely paralysed. The offender received a sentence of 16 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. He was also sentenced for other matters including an assault with intent to rob armed with an offensive weapon.

65In R v Amohanga; R v Rai [2005] NSW CCA 249; 155 A Crim R 202 the victim was lured to a flat under the pretext that a prostitute was going to have sex with him. There the two co-offenders attacked him. He was beaten ""mercilessly"", one offender being armed with a tyre lever and the other with an iron bar about 4 feet in length. The victim was beaten unconscious and left at the scene. The victim underwent a craniotomy and later, a cranioplasty. He was left seriously and permanently impaired, both physically and mentally, and would require support for the rest of his life. Both offenders had histories of offences involving armed robbery and violence. A successful Crown appeal increased the sentence from 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years to 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months.

66The characterisation of the objective circumstances of the offence by the applicant is too generous. In my opinion, there was gratuitous violence exhibited towards Ms Barlow. No demand for property was made before she was attacked. The attack itself, i.e. striking blows to the face with a house brick, was brutal and savage. The issue of deprivation of liberty is entirely neutral. In this case, the victim was rendered unconscious so that the question of deprivation of liberty simply did not arise. The same observation is applicable to the proposition that the attack was not prolonged in any way. 

67The juxtaposition of lack of planning and desperation for drugs, over-simplifies what occurred. Apart from the fact that a need for drugs is a subjective matter rather than an objective circumstance (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154 at [27]) there was some planning and the applicant's intention went beyond satisfying his desire for drugs. This is evident from his comment to Ms Walsh, some five hours before to the effect: ""I'm gonna smash someone's jaw in and steal their bag"". Quite clearly, the applicant had a dual intention not only to obtain money for drugs, but to cause pain and injury to effect that purpose after having been frustrated by the rebuff in his earlier attempted robbery.

68The submission that arming oneself's with a rock, rather than a more modern weapon, makes an offence less objectively serious is surprising. It is not the type of weapon which is significant, but the intention behind the arming of an offender and how the weapon is deployed. Despite the applicant's protestations to the contrary, it is clear from his actions that his intention in arming himself with the house brick or rock was not just to threaten a potential victim but to injure the victim by rendering her helpless after a blow to the head.

69In submissions the applicant said that he was not seeking to support these grounds of appeal by reference to some gruesome sequence of offences, each being more serious than the other. However, the submission to the effect that the injuries to Ms Barlow did not put the offence into a worst case category seeks to do exactly that. The injuries to Ms Barlow were horrific and life-threatening. The medical evidence is that her amenity of life has been substantially ruined and that she will suffer significant physical and psychological consequences for the rest of her life. It is unhelpful to submit that in some other cases injuries suffered by the victims have been more serious.

70As was said in Veen No 2:

""... the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; (1987) 61 ALJR 525, at p 527; 74 ALR 1, at p 5. That does not mean that a lesser penalty must be imposed if it be possible to envisage a worse case; ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness. A sentence which imposes the maximum penalty offends this principle only if the case is recognizably outside the worst category.""

71The crucial question is whether on the objective circumstances of the offence in count 3, it was open to his Honour to place it in the worst case category. For the reasons set out in the factual background and above, I am firmly of the opinion that it was open to his Honour to do so.

72In relation to the applicant's reliance upon the cases of El-Andouri and Amohanga, I have already referred to the observations of the plurality in Hili. It is useful to set out what was said:

""53 Next, in seeking consistency, sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. In the present matter, the prosecution produced detailed information, for the sentencing judge and for the Court of Criminal Appeal, about sentences that had been passed in other cases arising out of tax evasion as well as cases of customs and excise fraud and social security fraud. Care must be taken, however, in using what has been done in other cases.

54 In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".

55 As the plurality said in Wong:

""[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.""""

73An examination of the two cases to which this Court was referred, not surprisingly, bears out those cautionary directions by the High Court.

74El-Andouri was an appeal against severity by the offender. The fact that this Court rejected the appeal indicates only that the sentence passed was within the range of sentences available in that no lesser sentence was appropriate. It does not mean that a higher sentence would not also have been within the range of proper sentencing options. Significantly, no issue was taken with the sentencing judge's categorisation of the offence as being in the worst category. The offender in that case had the advantage of youth (19) and a comparatively minor criminal record by comparison with that of the applicant in this case. In addition, he was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation; he had demonstrated contrition and had family support. The applicant in this case did not have the advantage of such findings.

75In Amohanga the first distinguishing feature is that this was a Crown appeal. At the time that appeal was heard, the principle of double jeopardy applied so that while the court was entitled to increase the offender's sentence, such an increase ""should be no higher than the least which could properly have been imposed at first instance and in the exercise of the Court's discretion they may be lower"" (Amohanga at [43] per RS Hulme J).

76The offender in that case was aged 26 and there were totality problems in that he had been sentenced by another judge for entirely unrelated offences onto which the offences, the subject of the appeal, had been accumulated. A number of errors had been made by the sentencing judge to the offender's detriment which also had to be taken into account by this Court. There were also issues of delay and uncertainty which had to be taken into account (Amohanga at [65]).

77These cases are of limited value, not only for the reasons set out in Hili, but because their factual backgrounds are so different to that under consideration in these proceedings.

78The issue is not whether a lower sentence could have been passed in respect of count 3, but whether it was open to his Honour to impose the sentence which he did. If, as I have found, it was open to his Honour to categorise this offence as being in the worst category, then in accordance with Veen, it was open to his Honour to have regard to the applicant's appalling criminal record when taking into account the principles of retribution, deterrence and the protection of society.

79A brief statement of the matters to which his Honour had regard in relation to count 3 make it clear why it was open to his Honour to categorise this offence as falling within the worst category and to impose the sentence which he did. The applicant intended to bash someone and get their bag. He chose a female who was vulnerable by reason that she was alone on a deserted early morning street. The attack took place in a secluded setting. Without any demand for her property, Ms Barlow was set upon in an unprovoked and ferocious attack. While the weapon may have only been a rock or house brick, it was used with devastating consequences and was obviously capable of causing serious injury. The attack was explosive in execution and continued while the victim was on the ground to the point where the applicant thought that he had killed her. Added to those matters were the devastating injuries suffered by Ms Barlow and their consequences, together with the need to protect the public having regard to the applicant's appalling criminal record.

Ground of Appeal 5: The learned judge erred in his assessment of totality resulting in an overall sentence which was manifestly excessive.

80The applicant accepted that Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 requires the fixing of ""an appropriate sentence"" for each offence before considering questions of accumulation, concurrence or totality. The applicant also accepted that a determination whether to accumulate or not is discretionary and that there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively (Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41). The applicant submitted, however, that after an appropriate sentence is imposed in respect of each offence and the question of accumulation is addressed, the total sentence imposed must properly reflect the totality of the criminality (R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [37]). The applicant submitted that not only were the individual sentences excessive, but that the degree of accumulation of each sentence had produced error resulting in an aggregate sentence that was manifestly excessive and exceeded the total criminality involved.

81As already indicated, I have concluded that the sentence passed for count 2 is manifestly excessive and that the applicant will need to be re-sentenced in relation to that offence. Had I not reached that conclusion, there is nothing in the accumulation of the sentences by his Honour which bespeaks error. It is only because of the need to re-sentence the applicant in respect of count 2 that it is necessary to adjust the extent of the concurrency and accumulation which is reflected in the aggregate sentence passed by his Honour.

82Taking into account the objective and subjective circumstances to which I have already referred, the sentence which I propose for count 2 is imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 8 months. 

83Allowing for an appropriate adjustment for totality, the orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) Leave to appeal is granted.

(2) The appeal is allowed.

(3) The sentences imposed by his Honour on 16 December 2010 are quashed and in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced as follows:

Count 1: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to commence 14 August 2009 and expire 13 February 2012 with a balance of term of 1 year to expire 13 February 2013.

Count 2: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years to commence 14 May 2011 and expire 13 May 2013 with a balance of term of 8 months to expire 13 January 2014.

Count 3: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years and 6 months to commence 14 May 2012 and to expire 13 November 2023 with a balance of term of 5 years and 3 months to expire 13 February 2029.

The aggregate sentence which I propose is 19 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 14 years and 3 months.

84BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Hoeben JA.

2759349,R v Stanyard [2012] NSWDC 106,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: On 25 May 2012 I convicted Mr Stanyard of two offences of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. I delivered a judgment on that day which set out in some detail the circumstances of the collision which led to two young girls suffering serious injury, one catastrophically so. 

2I need not repeat what I said on that occasion beyond noting that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately drove his small Suzuki four wheel drive vehicle over a sand dune at a speed which caused it to become airborne. As it fell forward down the steep face of the sand dune it rotated until when it hit the sand at the bottom it rolled forward onto its roof. 

3As a result of that Ms Free suffered two broken arms. Ms Crawford was rendered a tetraplegic. Her mother read a victim impact statement to the Court today. The statement itself was tendered. It is easy to imagine the consequences of being unable to move from the neck down, but Ms Crawford's victim impact statement was an eloquent explanation of how her life had changed as a result of the offender's misconduct on 7 February 2009. No one would seriously challenge the suggestion that the injuries suffered to Ms Crawford, are in the worst category of grievous bodily harm.

4She cannot even scratch herself when she feels any itch. She cannot give herself a drink. She cannot feed herself, brush her teeth or brush her hair. For obvious reasons she did not go into the indignities of daily personal care, but they too are easy to imagine. Her life has changed irrevocably as a result of what the offender did. 

5When she ultimately thinks about the sentence that I will impose upon the offender, she is entitled to respond by saying that that sentence is, as far as she is concerned, lenient, after all she might think she has been given a life sentence and in one sense that is true. But it is important to remember that I sentence Mr Stanyard according to the law. The maximum penalty for each of these offences is seven years imprisonment and that is reserved for offending in the worst category. Although, as I have said, the harm that Ms Crawford suffered is in the worst category of grievous bodily harm, it does not follow that the offence itself is in the worst category of offending, thereby deserving the maximum penalty of imprisonment appropriate to that offence.

6I also sentence in accordance with authority, particularly the two guideline judgments issued by the Court of Criminal Appeal, R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. It is to be noted that the very first guideline judgment issued by the Court of Criminal Appeal was for the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. That guideline judgment followed a series of, usually successful, Crown appeals which indicated that sentencing judges were not treating seriously enough offences of this type. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Jurisic and Whyte corrected what it held to be was an inappropriate sentencing regime. I will have something to say about the guideline judgments in a little while.

7The offender is now twentyseven years of age, he was twentyfour at the time of his offending. He appears to have been a productive member of society. Evidence was tendered and he gave evidence himself of having been in full-time employment until I revoked his bail last Friday.

8He has many family and friends in support of him today and he had support throughout the trial as well. His former partner, to whom he has a fouryear-old son, and his current partner, to whom he has a daughter a mere sixteen weeks of age, are present in Court today. 

9It is expected that his partner will have to give up her accommodation as a result of the offender being unable to assist in paying rent as he serves the inevitable full-time custodial sentence that I must impose upon him. 

10In common with almost every offender who has committed an offence of this type he expressed his remorse today. Of course he was correct when he said nothing was meant to come out like this. He did not intend to harm anyone. He certainly did not intend Ms Crawford to suffer the terrible injuries that she suffered, but that is almost universal in cases of this kind. Had he intended harm of course he would have been facing much more serious charges. And so when I think about the effect of the offender's expressed remorse, which I accept, it has to be remembered that in almost every other case of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm similar sentiments are expressed by the offender.

11The offender did not plead guilty. Of course he is not to be punished for that but he does not receive a discount for the utilitarian benefit which a plea of guilty would have brought. The absence of a plea of guilty is also relevant when I consider the guideline sentences postulated in Jurisic and Whyte as I will shortly demonstrate.

12The offender has a criminal history of not much moment, but also a traffic history. For someone still relatively young he has accumulated a significant number of offences. True it is as Mr Dailly pointed out, none of them are major offences but they are offences of some regularity. Even if I accept what Mr Stanyard said about two of the offences on his traffic history which show offences after 7 February 2009, the awful experience of that day has not persuaded Mr Stanyard to drive in a way which does not involve breaches of the road rules, and before that day as the Crown points out he has lost his licence on two occasions. Most people go through their driving history never losing their licences on a single occasion. The offender's traffic history does him no credit at all.

13He is a young man and was of course younger at the time of this offending. In one sense the offence represents the foolishness of youth, the exuberance of young people and their failure to appreciate the consequence of what they are doing.

14When I look at the offence in objective terms, even though the offender was travelling at a speed well in excess of a safe speed, I do not consider that objectively this offence is of the same gravity of other offending which involves high speed travel along the roadway. I will explain why.

15A person who travels at a grossly excessive speed along a roadway must know from their experience of life and information they receive from various sources, that the chances of a collision involving serious injury or death are high. But no such information is widely known as to the consequences of driving over a sand dune at high speed. Perhaps if someone stopped to think about it, they might realise what might occur. But this sort of offence, as I have said, is committed in a way in which there is no calm reflection about the dangers which a particular course of driving carries.

16For those reasons I do not regard this offending in the same category as those who travel at grossly excessive speed along the highway thus causing their cars to become airborne over a slight bump in the road. 

17I said that I would return to the guideline judgment cases. The typically recurring case is of a young offender with good character with limited or no prior convictions. The offender here was young but he did not have limited prior convictions insofar as that term relates to driving offences. 

18There were two people who suffered grievous bodily harm as opposed to the death or permanent injury to a single person postulated in the typically recurring case. Both Ms Free and Ms Crawford were effectively strangers to the offender and Mr Stanyard suffered limited injuries himself. He has expressed genuine remorse and as I mentioned earlier did not enter a plea of guilty, the typically recurring case being postulated on a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. 

19A number of aggravating factors were also suggested for consideration relating to the moral culpability of the offender. 

20I have mentioned repeatedly because of its importance in the sentencing decision the terrible injuries suffered by Ms Crawford. Mr Dailly concedes that it is an aggravating circumstance that more than one person was put at risk with Mr Stanyard driving over that dune with two girls in the back of his vehicle.

21Mr Dailly also accepts, consistent with my earlier finding that the offender was showing off. This, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, was not intended by Mr Stanyard to be a repeat of the cautious driving and descent observed by one witness earlier that day. 

22Mr Stanyard's passenger who got out of the car with Ms Free's camera intending to take a photo, was clearly intending and understood that Mr Stanyard would do something worth photographing. That is one of a number of circumstances which have led me to find beyond reasonable doubt that it was Mr Stanyard's intention that his vehicle become airborne, not in the manner that one might see in a Hollywood movie, but clearly in a manner which would have all four wheels leaving the surface of the sand. I am satisfied that Mr Stanyard was showing off and that that has led directly to Ms Free and Ms Crawford suffering grievous bodily harm.

23Mr Dailly also accepts that Mr Stanyard ignored warnings. There were concerns expressed in the vehicle as to what was about to happen. He ignored those concerns. He ignored the fears of the more sensible people in the vehicle that day with terrible consequences. 

24It is conceded that there should be some partial accumulation to reflect the circumstance that more than one person suffered grievous bodily harm. 

25Sentencing in this type of case is always quite difficult because on the one hand we have enormous consequences for Ms Crawford and on the other hand we have an offender who in no way intended those awful consequences. I have to sentence the offender based on the results and also based on his moral culpability, but a person's moral culpability can still be high, even when they do not intend what occurred. This is such a case. 

26I sentence the offender as follows: For the offence involving Ms Free the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year and a head sentence of two years to date from 25 May 2012. 

27For the offence involving Ms Crawford the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of two and a half years and a head sentence of four and a half years to date from 25 May 2013. 

28The offender's non-parole period will expire on 24 November 2015 on which day he is eligible to be released to parole. The overall sentence consists of a nonparole period of three and a half years and a head sentence of five and a half years. The offender is disqualified from driving for four years from 25 May 2012.

2759365,Environment Protection Authority v Bourke Shire Council [2012] NSWLC 3,"Judgment

1Bourke Shire Council (Council) has pleaded guilty to an offence of transporting waste to a facility that could not be used for that purpose in breach of s 143(1)(a) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (POEO Act).

2The maximum penalty for the offence by a Corporation is $1,000,000: s 143(1) POEO Act.

3Under s 215(2) POEO Act the maximum penalty that may be imposed in the Local Court is $110,000. That amount was an increase from $22,000 and came into effect on 6 February 2012. These proceedings were commenced in the Local Court on 28 November 2011. The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) submits that although there were no transitional or savings provisions in respect of the increase in jurisdiction, the appropriate jurisdictional maximum penalty should be $22,000. I propose to proceed on that basis.

4An agreed statement of facts was tendered to the Court together with written submissions, two affidavits from the General Manager of Bourke Shire Council and numerous authorities.

Summary of agreed facts

5Council owns and operates a landfill known as the Bourke Shire Waste Depot. EPA is the appropriate regulatory authority for the Depot under the POEO Act. The Council does not hold an environment protection licence in relation to the Depot. The Depot is operated under an exception from the need to hold a licence (under cl 39(2)(f) of Schedule 1 of the POEO Act) where it:
(vi) receive(s) from off site less than 5,000 tonnes per year of general solid waste (putrescible), general solid waste (non-putrescible), clinical and related waste, asbestos waste, grease trap or waste tyres (or any combination of them), but only if the waste has been generated outside the regulated area.

6This exemption does not permit hazardous waste to be applied to the land at the Depot. A licence is required for that purpose.

7The Council also operates a water treatment plant in Bourke. Council used the chemical sodium fluoride to fluoridate the water. Sodium fluoride is a whitish crystalline solid that is classified as a Class 6 dangerous good under the Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail. It is therefore ""hazardous waste"" under the POEO Act by virtue of that classification.

8At 1 May 2007 Council had between 440kg and 600kg of sodium fluoride stored at the Water Treatment Plant in bags on a pallet in a shipping container. A further 500kg to 1000kg of sodium fluoride was stored at the plant in four plastic HAZMAT drums. The sodium fluoride had been acquired in 2002 for use in a fluoridation plant constructed in 1999 but never commissioned. Council wished to dispose of the sodium fluoride rather than use it in a new plant, which was to be commissioned in the near future. It obtained a quotation from Chemsal (hazardous waste disposal specialists) for $7,485.50 to remove and dispose of the stored sodium fluoride. Chemsal was expected to collect the waste on or about 25 June 2007. It was never collected.

9In September 2010 Council was preparing to commission a new fluoridation system and to have fresh stock of sodium fluoride delivered to the plant. It still needed to dispose of the old stock. By this time the outer woven bags of the sodium fluoride stored on the pallets was deteriorating, although the inner plastic wrap remained intact. Council's Manager Environmental Services, Mr Bernie Wilder, had done some research and determined that the sodium fluoride could be disposed of at the Depot. In part he relied upon Council's copy of the material safety data sheet for sodium fluoride. Although this document correctly identified sodium fluoride as a Class 6 dangerous good, Mr Wilder failed to appreciate that such a classification made sodium fluoride hazardous waste. He passed on his determination to Mr Willoughby (Environmental Services and Development Officer) who in turn told Mr Brown (Manager of Waste and Wastewater) of Mr Wilder's decision. Mr Brown instructed his team leader Mr Stephens to take the sodium fluoride to the Depot for disposal.

10On 11 October 2010, Mr Willoughby telephoned the EPA and left a voicemail message for a Mr Tanswell to confirm that Council could dispose of sodium fluoride at the Depot. He advised Mr Brown he had not heard back from the EPA. A risk assessment sheet of one page was prepared but did not consider any environmental risks associated with this disposal.

11On 12 October 2010, Mr Brown instructed Mr Stephens and a Mr Hopley to wrap the bags of sodium fluoride ""like asbestos"" because it was a high risk substance, transport it to the Depot and place it at the bottom of the landfill. The sodium fluoride was then wrapped, taken to the Depot and placed at the bottom of an area known as ""Cell 2"" about 117 meters from the depot boundary. It was then covered with waste to a depth of four metres and finally covered sometime later with a layer of material containing clay, sand and gravel. The top layer was intended to prevent entry of water into the waste and to direct any flow of water away to the drains.

12On 20 October 2010, Council's OH&S Officer Mr Ryan became aware that the sodium fluoride was missing from the plant. He reported this fact to his superiors. The General Manager, Mr Wise, was advised that the sodium fluoride had been disposed of at the Depot. Mr Wise was at a meeting in Cobar at the time and upon his return to Bourke the next day, he convened a meeting with Mr Brown, Mr Ryan and the Manager of Corporate Services, Ms Brown. They discussed the disposal and the hazardous nature of sodium fluoride but not whether the Depot was legally able to receive such a substance or the effect of the actual classification of sodium fluoride. Mr Wise regarded the matter as closed.

13Mr Ryan however clearly had some concerns. On 28 October 2010 he filed an OH&S incident report recommending that the sodium fluoride be removed from the Depot and be properly disposed of by a licensed contractor. He also sought a full investigation into the disposal by 15 December 2010. If his recommendations were not followed he advised that he would report the matter to the EPA and WorkCover.

14The General Manager agreed to reconsider the disposal. He asked Mr Wilder to review the disposal and report back to him by 15 December 2010.

15On 1 November 2010 Mr Tanswell called Mr Willoughby back in relation to his earlier call. Mr Tanswell was not told the waste had already been placed at the Depot. Mr Tanswell advised Mr Willoughby that Council would need to assess disposal in accordance with the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW) ""Waste Classification Guidelines"". Mr Willoughby was told these guidelines were available on the DECCW website. This information was passed onto Mr Wilder.

16On 8 December 2010 Mr Wilder reported back to Mr Wise that he had ""thoroughly investigated the matter from the Environmental Services section perspective and legislation under which we operate"". Mr Wilder recommended that Mr Ryan be advised as follows:
(1)""The matter has been extensively researched by Management and the disposal to landfill represents current industry best practice and meets environmental protection requirements.
(2)There is no reasonable justification for retrieval of the waste from its current location because it is unlikely that the material will be disturbed or subjected to action by strong acids in its present location...."".

17On 13 December 2010 Mr Wise sent a memo to Mr Ryan. Included in the memo were these words ""I have requested a detailed investigation and written report of best practice strategies for disposal of fluoride, and this has reassured me that the fluoride was appropriately disposed of, and any suggestion of removing the fluoride would be counter-productive"". There followed some observations by Mr Wise about Mr Ryan's attitude to himself and Mr Ryan's threats to go to a higher authority. On 16 December 2010 the EPA received a confidential telephone call alleging that Council had illegally disposed of sodium fluoride at the Waste Depot in Bourke. Senior Management at the Council made no report to the EPA.

18EPA then investigated the complaint. Initially not all documents requested by EPA were provided by the Council apparently because they misunderstood what was required to be produced. However after 16 February 2011 there was co-operation and compliance by the Council with the EPA investigation.

19On 8 June 2011 EPA issued the Council with a Clean-up Action under s 91 POEO Act. Council complied with all the requirements of the notice at Council's cost. The sodium fluoride was removed intact and transferred to an appropriate disposal site at Blayney. Soil sampling and testing confirmed that there was no contamination of the soil at the Bourke Waste Depot. EPA issued a notice of satisfaction to the Council on 1 September 2011.

20On 15 September 2011 Mr Wilder resigned as an employee from Council. Mr Brown also resigned on 17 February 2012.

Environmental Harm 

21As part of the statement of facts a number of photographs were tendered together with an agreed statement of potential harm. It was conceded that there was in fact no actual environmental harm caused by Council's actions. A summary of the harm alleged follows.

22Sodium fluoride is an inorganic compound. Fluoride is naturally present in water and soils. It is found in higher concentrations in seawater (up to 1.5mg/L) than in freshwater (0.01 to 0.3mg/L) and accordingly sodium fluoride is added to drinking water in some parts of Australia to reach a safe level of approximately 1mg/L. At that level it poses negligible risk to organisms in the environment. Concentrations above 1.5mg/L could increase risk due to the toxicity of fluoride ion.

23Landfills containing mixed waste substances such as Cell 2 at Bourke are dynamic. Waste shifts over time as it breaks down. The plastic wrapping around the sodium fluoride may have been pierced by a sharp object or may have eventually degraded, allowing the sodium fluoride to escape. There was insufficient evidence to guarantee that the waste cover placed over the buried sodium fluoride would permanently exclude water from the cell. As sodium fluoride is highly soluble in water, any penetration of water could have led to the sodium fluoride solubilising.

24If the sodium fluoride had solubilised in percolating water, this could have been taken into leachate. If the leachate accumulated at the bottom of the cell it may have been pumped into an evaporation pond. The amount of leachate generated by a landfill depends upon factors such as rainfall, the contents of the waste and the ability of water to enter the cell. As Bourke has a semi arid climate, Cell 2 generates less leachate than landfills say on the coast might be expected to generate. If leachate had been pumped to an evaporation pond then it may have been consumed by birds or animals and would be hazardous and perhaps fatal to those animals. There was however no evidence of leachate from this disposal.

25Although the offence did not result in environmental harm, it had the potential to cause environmental harm. Had the offence gone undetected then it is likely over time that actual harm may have resulted from the disposal. 

Costs incurred by Council

26Council has paid the following costs associated with the offence:
(1)$444.00 to EPA for Cleanup Notice
(2)$5,995.00 to ERM for a risk assessment report
(3)$24,944.70 to Cleanaway Environmental Services for the lawful disposal of the waste (a cost the EPA says Council would have incurred anyway to properly dispose of the waste).
(4)$14,000.00 to EPA for legal costs.

27Council co-operated with the EPA during its investigation. Council has no prior convictions.

28It is a matter to be taken into account in respect of penalty that the defendant Council has paid agreed costs.

Purpose of Sentencing and Matters Relevant to an Environmental Offence

29Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 states the purpose for which a Court may impose a sentence on an offender: 
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c) to protect the community from the offender, 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
 
30Where the Defendant is a Council, ""there is no principle that a penalty should be increased by reason that the defendant is a public authority rather than a private person"" nor should a Council ""receive a more lenient penalty merely because of its status as a public body"": Preston J in EPA v Ballina Shire Council [2006] 148 NSWLEC 289 at [85]-[86].

31In determining the appropriate penalty for a pollution offence, two things are to be borne in mind; the seriousness with which the community regarded the pollution and the purpose to be achieved by the imposition of a fine. Those who handle dangerous chemicals must be regarded as being under a heavy obligation to the rest of the community to do so with the utmost care: Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 113 LGERA 357.

32In environmental matters, courts should exercise their discretion in relation to penalty on the principle that the more serious the lasting environmental harm involved, the more serious the offence and ordinarily, the higher the penalty: Camilleri's Stock Feed Pty Limited v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683.

33""While it is the function of the Court itself to assess the seriousness of the offence in question, the maximum penalty available for an offence reflects the 'public expression' by parliament of the seriousness of the offence"": R v H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 65.

34The sentence must serve the purpose of general deterrence and this is particularly important in relation to environmental offences: Bentley v BGP Properties (2006) 145 LGERA 234.

35The POEO Act sets out the matters to be taken into account by the Court in sentencing for an offence under the Act:
241 Matters to be considered in imposing penalty 
(1) In imposing a penalty for an offence against this Act or the regulations, the court is to take into consideration the following (so far as they are relevant): 

(a) the extent of the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence, 
(b) the practical measures that may be taken to prevent, control, abate or mitigate that harm, 
(c) the extent to which the person who committed the offence could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence, 
(d) the extent to which the person who committed the offence had control over the causes that gave rise to the offence, 
(e) whether, in committing the offence, the person was complying with orders from an employer or supervising employee. 
(2) The court may take into consideration other matters that it considers relevant.
 
Nature and seriousness of the Offence

36In EPA v Geoff Robinson Pty Ltd [2011] NSWLEC 14 the Court said that the objective seriousness of the offence is ""the primary factor the Court must consider when determining sentence"". In Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd the Court noted that regard must be had to the defendant's state of mind in committing the offence and the defendant's reasons for the commission of the offence in determining the objective seriousness of the offence.

37Craig J in Environment Protection Authority v Hanna [2010] NSWLEC 98 stated at [38]:
The objective seriousness of the offence is illuminated by the nature of the statutory scheme. Relevant to the offences charged, the legislature has prescribed a highly regulated scheme for the disposal of waste. This is undoubtedly due to the harm to the environment, including risk to human health, which is, or may potentially be caused by the improper disposal of waste. By reference to the definitions of both 'pollution' and 'harm' found in the POEO Act, disposal of waste other than at a licensed facility is taken, for the purposes of the POEO Act, to have caused environmental harm.

38Preston CJ in EPA v Waste Recycling and Processing Corp [2006] NSWLEC 419 said at [146]: 
Harm can include harm to the environment and its ecology. Harm to an animal or plant not only adversely affects that animal or plant, it also affects other biota that have ecological relationships to that animal or plant; Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd at 174.

39Council submits that the objective seriousness of the offence is low. Mr Wilder was negligent in his assessment of the requirements that Bourke Shire Council was required to meet and as a result other Council officers including the General Manager subsequently fell into error. Accordingly as this was a case of error as to the appropriate way to dispose of the waste, it is submitted that there was not the wilfulness or deception that is found in many of the other prosecutions for breaches of s 143 POEO Act. In this case it would not have been difficult to determine that sodium fluoride was a toxic substance that required special methods of disposal. As submitted by Ms Cory for the EPA, a simple Google search would have clarified the status of sodium fluoride. This was a fact that was easily discoverable and Council could have taken simple steps to properly dispose of the waste. Council's own website confirmed that its Depot was NOT accepting hazardous waste.

40That it falls at the lower end of the scale of seriousness is confirmed by the proceedings being commenced in this Court. The EPA can deal with matters in three ways. They can issue a Penalty Infringement Notice (in this case $5,000), commence a prosecution in the Local Court (maximum penalty now $110,000 but as at November 2011 $22,000) or proceed in the Land and Environment Court where the maximum penalty is $1,000,000. In addition the likelihood of serious harm was reduced by both the manner of the disposal and the fact that Bourke is a semi arid area with relatively low annual rainfall.

41I am therefore satisfied that this is not a serious breach, however it is difficult to see how it could fall much below the Court's jurisdictional threshold on penalty as at November 2011 of 2.2% of the worst case. $22,000 is the jurisdictional limit and not the maximum penalty for the purpose of determining an appropriate penalty: R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317.

Application of s 10 Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act

42In considering the application of s 10 a Court can consider the following: 
(a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition,
(b) the trivial nature of the offence,
(c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed,
(d) any other matter that the Court thinks proper to consider.

43The offence does not have to be trivial. In R v Paris [2001] NSWCCA 83 at [42], Simpson J held:
It is not necessary to the application of s10 that the offence be characterised as trivial; the four factors mentioned in subs 3 are, in my view, intended to be disjunctive and nonexhaustive.

44Council submits that the proceedings should be dismissed without conviction. Mr Down for the Council points to the good character of the Council, its co-operation with the EPA, its early plea of guilty, contrition and remorse and changes implemented to ensure that such an offence would not be committed in the future. Council has no prior convictions. There was no environmental harm and Council acted in good faith although mistaken as to the proper method of disposal.

45The EPA submit that dismissal under s 10 is not appropriate because this is more than a technical breach, was foreseeable and could have been avoided. In Hunter Water Board v State Rail Authority of NSW (No 2) (1992) 75 LGRA 22 Stein J said at 33 that the Court ""has not infrequently stated that it will be a rare case when a dismissal under s556A is seen as appropriate to an environmental offence"". Section 556A was the section in the Crimes Act 1900 superseded by s 10. In that case although there was in fact little harm, the potential for harm was serious. The Defendant was fined $15,000 and ordered to pay costs.

46In Thorneloe v Filipowski [2001] NSWCCA 213 Spigelman CJ said at [151]:
The discretion conferred by s10 is wide-ranging. There is no warrant for treating the scope and range of matters which it is 'proper' for a sentencing judge to take into account in a narrow way. Nevertheless, it is a discretion which must be exercised judicially. 
Also at [171] his Honour made this observation: 
Even in the case of an offence of strict liability, no public purpose is served by recording a conviction or imposing a penalty in circumstances where the relevant accused could not, as a matter of practical reality, have done anything to ensure that the offence or, in the case of a result offence, the adverse consequences of the conduct, did not occur. 
At [178] his Honour made this comment: 
It is, in my opinion, relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s10 of the Sentencing Act, in the context of a strict liability offence, to consider what the applicant for the benefit of s10 could have done to avert the event that has occurred. 

Spigelman CJ then determined that the Master of the vessel in that case had done all that was reasonably practical to avoid what amounted to a small discharge of oil into the water. As he had an unblemished record, the pollution was small and short of virtual perfection it was difficult to identify any other steps the Master could have taken to avoid the discharge, it was appropriate to apply s 10. Hulme J and Howie J concurred with the Chief Justice and Mr Thorneloe was not convicted.

47This is not a case where s 10 should be applied. Although there was no harm, there was potential for harm. The steps required to avoid the illegal disposal were modest and reasonable. Although I accept that specific deterrence is not needed to ensure future compliance by the Defendant Council, general deterrence is an important factor in exercising my judicial discretion in this case against a dismissal. It is important that all defendants including Local Government and Statutory Authorities understand that the Courts will enforce compliance with the requirements to safely dispose of hazardous waste. 

48There is a clear distinction between the reasons given by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Thorneloe v Filipowski for the application of s10 and the facts of this case. The actions of the Council employees at Bourke were careless. Mr Ryan's concerns were ignored. There was initial reluctance to either ""confess"" to the EPA that the sodium fluoride had already been disposed of illegally or to fully comply with the initial EPA request for information.

Factors to consider on penalty

49Deterrence: In EPA v Barnes [2006] NSWCCA 246 Kirby J said at [31]-[32]: 
Deterrence, especially in the context of environmental offence, is a matter of some importance. In Axer Pty Limited v EPA Mahoney JA said this: (at 359) ""the quantum of the fines which the legislation allows to be imposed has no doubt been fixed not merely to indicate the seriousness with which such pollution is regarded, but also to deter those engaged in such activities and to procure that they will take the precautions necessary to ensure that it does not occur."" 

In Camilleri's Stock Feeds Pty Limited v EPA Kirby P (Campbell and James JJ agreeing) made the following comment in the context of the objects of pollution control legislation: (at 701) ""The objects of the Act and its provisions would require a substantial sentence to punish the appellant, to deter others and to encourage full compliance with the Act by the appellant and others.""

50Preston J in Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Limited at [139] said this: 
The sentence must serve the purpose of general or public deterrence. It is the duty of the Court to see that the sentence which is imposed will operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar crimes by those who might otherwise be tempted by the prospect that only light punishment will be imposed... 
Further at [140]:
This factor is particularly relevant to environmental offences. Persons will not be deterred from committing environmental offences by nominal fines.

51Plea of Guilty: s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires a Court to take into account a guilty plea. The Court must take into account both the fact of the plea and the time when it was made: R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142. In R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, the Court of Criminal Appeal indicated that the utilitarian value of the plea ""should generally be assessed in the range of ten to twenty five percent discount on sentence"" for the utilitarian component of avoiding the necessity for a trial. His Honour RA Hulme J at the Annual Magistrates Conference in 2011 suggested that in the Local Court the discount to be allowed should be less than 25% as the value of a trial in that jurisdiction is substantially less than a trial in a superior Court involving a jury. It has been my experience that in general, discounts of up to 25% have regularly been applied in the Local Court. In the absence of some judicial direction by a superior Court it is my view that the 25% discount remains available in the Local Court.

52Bourke Shire Council indicated a plea of guilty at the first available opportunity. They have co-operated to the extent that a joint statement of agreed facts was prepared and tendered to the Court. Written submissions on sentence were prepared by both parties to minimise Court time. The saving to the Court and the parties by this co-operative approach must in my view attract the full benefit of making such a plea. I intend to allow a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of this plea.

53Extra curial punishment: Extra curial punishment refers to any serious loss or detriment an offender has suffered or will suffer as a result of committing an offence, quite apart from any punishment imposed by a sentencing judge: R v Einfeld [2009] NSWSC 119 at [154]. What weight is to be given to any extra curial punishment is a factor for the Court to consider on the particular facts and circumstances of the matter before it: Director of Public Prosecutions v D'Arcy [2009] NSWLC 1 at [26].

54The Council submits that the loss of two senior staff as a result of this matter amounts to extra curial punishment. Although such a submission may seem strange in the metropolitan area it has some weight when one considers the circumstances of this Council. Bourke is a small town located approximately 800 kilometres north west of Sydney. It is located in a semi arid area where there is little rainfall and the summers are extremely hot. There is limited public transport. Bourke has no regular air service, has no train service and is only serviced by a State Rail bus service three days a week. There are no theatres or cinemas, limited sporting facilities, shops are closed at 5pm and shuttered for the night. Crimes including break and enter of premises, damage to property and car stealing are common. There is no dentist and not even a fulltime hairdresser. Attracting suitably qualified staff to a remote town like Bourke must present significant problems. Magistrates and Judges attend on a fly in/ fly out arrangement, as do many medical services. The loss of Mr Wilder and Mr Brown will have an impact on the defendant not only as to their experience but also in the likely cost of attracting experienced replacements. I take the loss to the defendant of Mr Wilder and Mr Brown as employees into account as a factor in justifying some reduction in the penalty otherwise applicable.

Penalty

55The maximum penalty for this offence is $1,000,000.00. In determining penalty I have taken into account the following factors:
(i) s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as to the purposes of sentencing;
(ii) s 241 POEO Act as to there being no actual harm but the potential for harm, the practical measures that could have avoided the offence, the foreseeability of harm and the extent to which the Defendant had control over the causes giving rise to the breach;
(iii) General and specific deterrence;
(iv) Mitigating factors including the early plea of guilty and assistance to the EPA, costs of the cleanup and these proceedings, that the Council has no prior offences and Council is unlikely to re-offend, measures taken to avoid environmental harm when the substance was placed at the waste site, the low risk of actual harm and extra curial punishment.

56No submissions were made on the ability of the defendant Council to pay a fine. 

57Taking into account all of the factors referred to above, the written and oral submissions of the parties and the objective seriousness of the breach, I impose a fine of $10,000, which is 1% of the maximum penalty. The fine reflects that the breach was of a very low level of seriousness but the quantum of the penalty serves to indicate that any illegal disposal of hazardous waste will have consequences that are more than a slap on the wrist.

Order 

58Bourke Shire Council is convicted and fined $10,000. I allow 28 days to pay the fine.

		13 June 2012",2012-05-31 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2759373,JRM v R [2012] NSWCCA 112,"Judgment
1HOEBEN JA:  I agree with RS Hulme J and the orders which he proposes.
2RS HULME J:  On 15 October 2010, this Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by Garling DCJ in respect of a number of offences.  In summary, the offences, the statutory provision relating to them and the maximum penalties provided are as follows:-
1.Having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years and under his authority - Crimes Act 1900 - s 66A(2) - life imprisonment.
2.Having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years and under his authority - Crimes Act 1900 - s 66A(2) - life imprisonment.
3.Possessing child abuse material - Crimes Act 1900 - s 91H(2) - 10 years.
4.Using a carriage service in a way that reasonable persons would regard as offensive - Commonwealth Criminal Code 1995 - s 474.17.
5.Using a child then under 14 for pornographic purposes - Crimes Act 1900 - s 91G - 14 years.
3The first two offences have, pursuant to the provisions of s 54A et seq of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
4The child involved, then aged 9, was the son of the Applicant and his wife, who was a co-offender in the case of the offence the subject of the fifth count and the third offence on the Form 1.  The victim had resided with his parents since birth.  The authorities first became aware of problems when the child commenced exhibiting unusual and inappropriate sexual conduct at school.
5The Applicant and his wife seem to have had an open attitude towards nudity.  One of his remarks to police officers was, ""I understand that you think we are wrong, but we think the human body is art and to be admired"".  He also made the point that no violence or pain had been inflicted, observing also that we are a ""very touchy feely family"".  It is clear also from the Facts Summary tendered before Garling DCJ that at least the first 4 charges were but representative of a course of conduct engaged in over a substantial period.
6From time to time, an online chat programme was used and activities photographed by video camera and broadcast on that chat programme.  Sometimes similar activities of others were watched by a similar method.
7The circumstances of the first offence were that the Applicant and his son were on the Applicant's bed before school one morning watching television.  The child was in a nightie and the Applicant was nude.  The Applicant felt the child's penis and then commenced to suck it.  Before the child when to school, the Applicant told him, ""Don't you tell anyone about this"".
8The second charge arises from remarks of the Applicant during a police interview in which he acknowledged allowing the complainant to suck his penis.  He told police words to the effect, ""It's just a quick suck, he doesn't stay there because he's too young to sort of know to do any different.  It's just in the art of bonding with your child"".  Asked whether that resulted in the Applicant having an erection, the Applicant said words to the effect, ""Probably started to, it wouldn't have been a full one 'cause he's not there long enough to make it full"".
9The third count arose in consequence of the police finding images on the Applicant's computer.  One included an unknown blonde female child of about 8 being both anally and vaginally sexually assaulted by an adult male, the child appearing to be clearly distressed, crying and wearing a black dog collar with silver coloured studs.  Also depicted was a young female child naked with legs apart while an adult female performed cunnilingus upon her.  
10Asked if there was any material showing the complainant in sexually explicit positions, the Applicant said:-
There shouldn't be.  I can't recall taking any.  Maybe just one, a picture of him and I playing on a bed both with a hard on as it was just something that happened.  Very funny.  
11The Applicant also admitted that he probably had more than 100 photographs and had been receiving child pornography on his computer for a couple of years.  Asked whether there were any images of children performing sexual acts upon adults, the Applicant replied:-
Yes, there will be, yes - if it's been forced sex I don't like it, but if it's a normal thing that happens and - the children are consenting to this, well why not.
12The fourth count also arose in consequence of what was recorded on the computer.  The Applicant and another male had communicated via Yahoo Messenger on 53 separate days.  On each occasion, the two males were nude and masturbating and on some occasions the Applicant and his wife were fondling each other.  The conversation which was recorded on many these occasions was of a sexually explicit nature.
13The fifth count arose out of an occasion when the complainant and his mother were lying on the bed in the early morning watching a DVD movie ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"".  The Applicant entered the room carrying a web cam and said to his wife, ""Suck (the complainant's) dick to show them that you can play too"".  The Applicant's wife rolled over towards the complainant and sucked his penis.  Asked about this incident, the Applicant said:-
We talk to a lot of nudists from around the world and you like to cam with other families and I'm sure if he is sitting beside me and we are camming with another family, he has been there with me.  We are just proving to people that we are real.
14Three offences on a Form 1 were also taken into account.  The first two of these were of committing an act of indecency towards the complainant, a child then under 10, an offence under the Crimes Act, s 61O(2).  The third was an aggravated indecent assault, an offence under s 61M(2).  The first offence was constituted by the Applicant's wife massaging the Applicant's penis to ejaculation in the presence of the complainant.  The second consisted of the Applicant massaging the complainant.  Asked whether the massage involved sexual contact, the Applicant replied to the effect:-
Of course, you are going to rub the genital area, aren't you?  It might happen once every three weeks, it might happen once every couple of days, it might not happen for a long while ... he likes to have his penis rubbed a little bit ... he's obviously going to get hard very quickly, even for a 9 year old.
15The third offence on the Form 1 was evidenced by a video recording of the Applicant's wife fellating him in the presence of the complainant sitting less than a metre away and watching.
16After allowing a discount of 25% for the Applicant's plea, the sentences imposed were as follows:-
Count 1:  Imprisonment for 10 years including a non-parole period of 7 years, both such periods commencing on 16 November 2011.
Count 2:  Imprisonment for 8 years including a non-parole period of 6 years, both such periods commencing on 16 November 2011.
Count 3:  Imprisonment for 3 years including a non-parole period of 1 year, both such periods commencing on 16 November 2010.
Count 4:  Imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing on 16 November 2010.
Count 5:  Imprisonment for 3 years including a non-parole period of 1 year commencing on 16 November 2009
17The effective sentence thus was imprisonment for 12 years including a non-parole period of 9 years, both such periods commencing on 16 November 2009.
18The grounds of appeal are:-
1.The judge erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of offences 1 and 2 by taking into account irrelevant considerations
2.The judge erred in assessing the objective seriousness of offences 1 and 2 as ""above the mid-range"" and ""somewhere in the middle of the mid to high range"".
19Garling DCJ addressed the question of where the first two offences fell in the range of objective seriousness.  As the grounds of appeal reflect, he found they were above the mid-range and somewhere in the middle of the mid to high range.  Summarised, his reasons for so concluding were that:-
1.There was a gross breach of trust.  I accept that part of the charge is that the child was under authority but, at this stage, I'm trying to place the offences within a range.  It is hard to imagine a greater breach of trust than what the male offender has committed.  This is his son who was entitled to be protected by his father, not abused by him.  His on has now lost both his parents and, until 18 years of age, will be in care.
2.There has been significant emotional harm.  I have set out that harm at an earlier stage and you add to it what I have just said, that is, the emotional harm of losing both parents.
3.The offences took place over a fairly lengthy period of time.
4.I also have to look at the overall series of offences which includes the use of the internet.
20His Honour also observed that he was ""satisfied in JM's sentence that counts 1 and 2 should be concurrent as they are part of the one set of sexual behaviour"".
21His Honour rejected a Crown submission that the Applicant's offences fell into the worst category or into the upper range of offending because:-
1.There was no penile penetration or the like.
2.The complainant was 9, an age not far removed from the maximum with which s 66BA is concerned.
3.There was no physical injury or threat.
4.The Court sees cases where the factual situation is significantly worse and the abuse goes on for a longer time.
22His Honour observed that the statistical information with which he had been provided was of no assistance because of the wide range of sentences.  He expressed the view that although there should be accumulation of some of the sentences, the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 should be concurrent ""as they are part of the one set of sexual behaviour"".
23His Honour recorded that the Applicant was in his late 50s at the time of sentence, had no prior criminal record.  His Honour was prepared to assume he was previously a person of good character.  His Honour found special circumstances but the partial accumulation he proposed would take those into account.  He accepted that the Applicant would probably have to serve his sentence in protective custody but his Honour did not regard this as a significant matter because, as he said, such a situation is dealt with by the prison authorities on a regular basis.
24His Honour also had before him a report from a psychologist Joanne Mercer concerning the condition of the victim and in particular the impact that his parents' actions had had on him. On the topic his Honour remarked:- The Crown tendered a report from Joanne Mercer, clinical psychologist.  It was objected to, however, I allowed it but I will take care with the report as it contains material that goes beyond the agree facts and was obtained for care proceedings.  The complainant is now under the responsibility of the Department of Community Services and he is in care.  His parents are not permitted to have any contact with him until he attains eighteen years of age.  This report was tendered in relation to both offenders to show that there was an aggravating factor, that is, significant emotional harm.  Ms Mercer said: 'The emotional impacts for the child are twofold.  He is struggling emotionally with an abundance of guilty relating to the consequences his parents are facing.  This stems from the sense of responsibility bestowed on him from his parents.  He does not fully recognise that he has been through an abusive and traumatic situation.  He is about to begin a complex and long-term therapeutic process that requires him to challenge nearly all his ingrained beliefs and trust'.
This opinion could hardly be controversial.  This young boy was sexually abused by his parents, those are the facts they agree to.  I do not need a medical report to tell me that this young boy would have suffered emotional harm, however, the report, as far as any non-controversial part of it is concerned, clearly confirms that.  I find that, as a result of the actions of the offenders, their son has suffered significant emotional harm. 
Grounds 1 and 2
25There can be no doubt that this ground is made out.  His Honour's reasons recorded above demonstrate that in assessing the criminality involved in the first and second offences, he took into account ""the overall series of offences which includes the use of the internet"" and, it is clearly to be inferred, the impact of the course of conduct indulged in by both his parents over an extended period.  The first two offences were not related to the internet in any way and while there was evidence that the first offence had occurred a few weeks prior to the victim being interviewed on 16 November 2009, there was no evidence as to the date upon which the second offence occurred beyond the terms of the charge which identified the time as between 1 January and 10 November 2009.  Accordingly his Honour's sentencing of the Applicant in respect of these offences miscarried.  
26His Honour's errors must also have affected his characterisation of these offences as ""above the mid-range"" and ""somewhere in the middle of the mid to high range"".  It is not suggested that the matter should be remitted to the District Court and it accordingly falls to this Court to re-sentence the Applicant on the first and second counts.  The Court may also make whatever adjustments may be appropriate to the starting dates of the other sentences - see Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 7(1A). 
27There were other errors in his Honour's sentencing.  Although it may be inferred that the offences the subject of count 1 and 2 did not occur on the one occasion, there was no basis for concluding that they ""took place over a fairly lengthy period of time"".  Furthermore they were sufficiently different and, not having occurred on the one occasion, there was no legitimate basis for his Honour to have made the sentence for the offence the subject of count 2 entirely concurrent with the sentence imposed for the count 1 offence.
28During the hearing of the appeal the Crown criticised his Honour's reference to having seen worse cases, submitting that this fact should not have influenced his Honour's consideration of the objective seriousness of the case before him.  However, his Honour's reference to the topic was rather in the context of placing the instant case in the range of offending against the statutory provision and not in judging its own objective seriousness.  In this respect he did not err.
29Relevant in the task of re-sentencing the Applicant are some other findings to which reference must be made.  Although his Honour had before him a report and evidence from a psychologist who had conducted an extensive interview with the Applicant and had formed the view that the Applicant posed a moderate-low risk of re-offending, his Honour concluded that it would be impossible for him to make any worthwhile finding in that regard.  His Honour also took the view that the Applicant had been sexually abusing the victim and doing it for his own sexual gratification.  There was evidence that justified that conclusion. 
30During the appeal the Crown also drew attention to his Honour's finding that the Applicant had committed a gross breach of trust, drawing attention to the recognition in MRW v R [2011] NSWCCA 260 at [77] that this is a concept distinct from abuse of authority that is an element of the offence (albeit, because of the possibility of double counting, one to which a sentencing judge should be careful not to give too much weight) - see MRW v R at [78].  When to this was added the fact that the Applicant's wife was complicit in some of the Applicant's offences, and had committed others, the result was that the victim had effectively lost both parents for the duration of his childhood.  The Crown submitted also that the victim was left not only with the trauma normally suffered by victims who had been abused, but also with the feelings of guilt, in consequence of what he had said when interviewed by the authorities, of being responsible for his parents' incarceration.
31I have no difficulty in accepting that all of the matters just referred to properly go in aggravation of the Applicant's offending, though it is also proper to recognise that in some respects the circumstances of the offending are likely not to have been as traumatic as those experienced by many victims whose situation the Court has to consider.
32During the hearing of the appeal, and against the possibility that this Court should re-sentence, an affidavit from by the Applicant was read stating that he has participated in a programme preparatory to participation in the CUBIT programme but that he has been informed that he will not be allowed to participate in the latter until his last 12 to 18 months in custody.  While in custody he has not had any institutional charges laid against him and because he is in protective custody, apart for a period of 3 months he spent in Long Bay correctional Centre, he has been unable to obtain employment. 
33Although I do not take other offences committed by the Applicant towards the victim as aggravating the offending charged, the fact that there were an appreciable number of such offences means that the offences the subject of counts 1 and 2 cannot be looked at as isolated occasions.  
34In the result, recognising that the offences the subject of counts 1 and 2 were separate from each other, and though each was very serious, I do not characterise them as highly as did Garling DCJ.  However, the sentences for them should be at least partially accumulated.  Garling DCJ found special circumstances as I would have done in light of the accumulation of sentences.  In respect of count 1 I would propose that the Applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years, together with a further term of 3 years and for count 2, to a non-parole period of 4 years with a further term of 16 months.  I would structure these sentences so that there combined effect is no longer than the sentence for count 1 imposed by Garling DCJ.
35Thus although the application for leave to appeal has been successful in that it has been shown that Garling DCJ erred and the sentences he imposed on counts 1 and 2 were affected by those errors, the effective sentence imposed on the Applicant will not be reduced.  That flows from the fact that, in my view, the offending the subject of counts 1 and 2 merited the effective sentence imposed for these counts.  Indeed, had I taken the view that the sentences for counts 1 and 2 should be reduced below the level imposed by Garling DCJ, there is much to be said for the view that, as counsel for the Applicant was advised, the degree of concurrency of the sentences for counts 3 to 5 should have been revisited, and this even though there was no Crown appeal.  At least the non-prole period for the third and fifth offences were very lenient.
36Accordingly, I propose the following orders:-
(1)Allow the appeal.
(2)Quash the sentences imposed by Garling DCJ on 15 October 2010 in respect of Counts 1 and 2 and in lieu thereof re-sentence the applicant as follows:-
(a)In respect of Count 2, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 16 November 2011 together with a further term of 16 months.
(b)In respect of Count 1, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 16 November 2014 together with a further term of 3 years.
(c)Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the applicant shall become eligible for parole 16 November 2018.
37FULLERTON J:  I agree with RS Hulme J.

2759374,Scott Alan May v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 111,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: On 7 May 2008, Scott May (""the appellant"") was indicted on a charge that on 2 May 2003 at Rozelle he did murder Andrew John Heavens (""the deceased""). As an alternative count he was charged with being an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased by Mr Ryan Burnes (""Mr Burnes""). The indictment was an ex officio indictment, the appellant having been charged for the same offences on 20 September 2006 but discharged on committal.

2Following a trial by a jury the appellant was convicted of the murder on 4 June 2008. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a total period of 36 years commencing on 16 January 2007 with a non-parole period of 27 years. 

3By Notice of Appeal dated 29 November 2010, the appellant sought leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence. Leave was necessary to appeal against conviction at least for the reason the appeal was out of time. No objection was taken to the grant of leave and it should be granted.

The appeal against conviction

4Four grounds of appeal were relied upon:

1The conviction of the appellant was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

2The directions (both in writing and orally) given on the question of extended joint criminal enterprise were erroneous and occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

3His Honour's directions as to evidence available to ""verify independently"" evidence of Ryan Burnes occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

4The learned trial judge erred in law in failing to leave the offence of manslaughter as an alternative verdict for the jury's consideration.

5Having regard to the nature of the grounds of appeal it is necessary to deal with the evidence as it emerged at the trial in some detail. I will adopt the language used by the witnesses where possible. The parties were able to reach agreement in respect of certain matters and produced an agreed chronology, which has to some extent assisted in the determination of the appeal. Production of such chronologies is to be encouraged particularly in areas where it is alleged that the verdict was unreasonable.

6A copy of the agreed chronology forms an attachment to this judgment.

7Grossly over-simplified the Crown case was that the appellant and deceased were drug dealers. The appellant sought to take over the deceased's business. On the evening of 2 May 2003, the appellant and the deceased in the company of Mr Burnes drove to Callan Park, Rozelle. The appellant agreed with Mr Burnes that if he (the appellant) gave a pre-arranged signal, Mr Burnes would shoot the deceased. At approximately 10.15pm at Callan Park Mr Burnes shot and killed the deceased. The Crown's primary case was that it occurred following a pre-arranged signal given by the appellant to Mr Burnes. Alternatively the Crown stated that it occurred in the course of a joint criminal enterprise as a consequence of which the appellant along with Mr Burnes was guilty of the murder. 

8Having regard to the agreed chronology there appears to be no issue that the deceased was killed at around 10.15pm on 2 May 2003. A number of witnesses gave evidence that around that time they heard what was variously described as three bangs or gunshots. All of them stated that they heard three bangs. Most stated there was one and then there was a pause before the second and third bangs. 

9There was evidence from a number of persons who observed the body of the deceased. Constable Barrett said that there was a cigarette butt between his two fingers on his left hand where the ash had burned down. Constable Hellessey gave the same evidence. He also stated that he found a large amount of cash on the deceased and two plastic lolly containers commonly used in the drug trade. Senior Constable Reilly gave similar evidence. She also stated that she saw two projectiles which were consistent with having entered the ground at an angle of 90 degrees. A Christiaan Pieterse who was described without objection as an expert in ballistics gave evidence. He stated he examined the deceased's body and observed three entry and three exit wounds. He stated they were probably discharged from the same gun, although he could not be 100 percent certain. 

10Detective Sergeant Kristina O'Hagan, an expert in the examination of firearms and ammunition, stated that she examined the ejection marks on the spent cartridges. She stated they were capable of being caused by a Colt 1911. Dr Botterill, a pathologist, stated the direct cause of death was the three gunshot wounds. The most serious was the first, but all three had caused damage because of what had occurred to the tissue of the lungs.

11DN, who described himself as a heroin user, gave evidence. He stated he met the deceased, known as Al, approximately six months before 2 May 2003. He also knew Al's girlfriend, LM. DN gave evidence that he came to assist the deceased in the distribution of drugs. He stated that he and another man met the deceased at Circular Quay and the deceased gave each of them a mobile phone and some heroin. The heroin was in two lots; one for $100 deals and one for $50 deals.

12About a week before the deceased was murdered DN said he had a discussion with Sean Rafferty. Mr Rafferty told him he could get a constant supply of good quality heroin.

13On the day of the murder DN said he met the deceased at Circular Quay. He was given two M&M containers. He saw him later in the day with a scooter. He gave the telephones back to the deceased together with $3,200 to $3,400. He heard the deceased have a number of telephone conversations, including one with LM. In a different conversation than the one with LM, DN knew from what the deceased said that he (the deceased) was being delayed ""because he [the deceased] had to go somewhere and do something"". 

14DN said he went home at about 8.30pm. He got a call from Mr Rafferty. He said thereafter he met Mr Rafferty near Central Station and they drove to DN's house in Paddington. They arrived there around 1.00am. Mr Rafferty showed him three mobile phones. DN said that he had seen them before with the deceased. He said Mr Rafferty gave him heroin and a blue Siemens mobile phone with a SIM card to put in it.

15DN said he knew the phone numbers of the deceased and tried to ring them. The phone was answered by Mr Rafferty. He asked where the deceased was. Mr Rafferty said ""we are just runners and we will be sweet"".

16DN said he commenced to work for Mr Rafferty the day following the murder. Mr Rafferty told him he had to make what the deceased was going to make the other guy, being $11,000 per day.

17In cross-examination DN agreed that when the police first spoke to him he went to great lengths to suggest he did not know Mr Rafferty. He was asked about a statement he made to the police in the course of which he said that about a week before the death of the deceased he received a call from a customer, Cass, who requested him to leave the deceased's employ and go and work for him. He agreed what he said was a lie and the person was really Mr Rafferty.

18DN also said that he had known Mr Rafferty for some time. He said he was given a new number by Mr Rafferty about a week before the deceased was killed which he was to give to certain people.

19In cross-examination DN said he saw the telephones in the car in which he and Mr Rafferty drove from Central to Paddington in the early hours of 3 May 2003. He said he was shown them whilst they were both seated in the parked car near his home at Paddington.

20As pointed out in the agreed chronology the telephone records tendered at the trial show the following phone calls:

(a)A call from the deceased to DN at 6.19pm on 2 May 2003.

(b)A call from Mr Rafferty to DN at 8.57pm on 2 May 2003.

(c)A call from DN to Mr Rafferty at 9.01pm on 2 May 2003.

(d)A call from Mr Rafferty to DN at 11.43pm on 2 May 2003. The tower location which picked up the call was at the corner of Wattle Street and Pyrmont Bridge Road.

(e)A call from Mr Rafferty to DN at 12.47am on 3 May 2003. The tower location which picked up the call was Elizabeth/Hunter Street in Sydney CBD.

(f)A call from Mr Rafferty to DN at 0.55am on 3 May 2003. The tower location which picked up the call was South Sydney adjacent to ""Erskineville 2"".

(g)A call at 1.07am from DN to Mr Rafferty on 3 May 2003 from an unknown location.

(h)Calls on the blue Siemens phone (the phone DN said was given to him by Mr Rafferty) to the phone number previously used by the deceased as a drug phone. These calls took place at 9.47am, 9.49am and 10.02am on 3 May 2003.

21Mr Sean Rafferty was called to give evidence. He admitted he knew the appellant, Scott May. He denied he knew the deceased. He denied that he received three mobile phones from the appellant, or that the appellant said to him ""You'll be starting tomorrow. Here's your phones"" on the night of 2 May. He denied he received a call from a person who thought he was Al on 3 May, or a call on that day from a person whom he thought was Al's wife.

22He was asked about evidence that he had given to the Police Integrity Commission. It was put to him that he told the Commission he met the appellant either at his place or down the road. He said he could not recall telling the Police Integrity Commission this and then denied saying it. It was then put to him that he told the Police Integrity Commission that the appellant said to him ""You'll be starting tomorrow. Here's your phones"" and that he then told ""Steve"" (an alias for DN). It was also suggested to him that he told the Police Integrity Commission that he met Steve at Michel's Patisserie, the appellant having dropped him off, and that they went back to his (Mr Rafferty's) house and made the caps and sold them. He said he could not remember suggesting this to the Police Integrity Commission. 

23It was then suggested to him that he told the Police Integrity Commission that the appellant told him that the phones he (the appellant) gave to him were work phones, that there were three and that he tried them the next day. He said he did not recall saying this but he always lied when he was on heroin and would have done anything to ""get out"".

24He denied he told the Police Integrity Commission that he had answered the phone and the callers thought he was the deceased. He denied that he said to the Police Integrity Commission that the deceased used to get a ferry across to the city.

25That part of the video of Mr Rafferty's evidence to the Police Integrity Commission which was put to him was shown to him. He admitted it was a video of him giving evidence.

26He admitted he made a statement to the police in July 2003, but says he was threatened that he would be charged with Andrew Heavens' murder. He said that at the time he did not know who Mr Heavens was. He said what he told the Police Integrity Commission was untrue and that the appellant, Scott May, was his mate.

27I have already referred to the telephone calls between Mr Rafferty and DN. In addition, the telephone records in evidence indicate Mr Rafferty called the appellant at 7.26pm on the evening of 2 May 2003 and sent an SMS to him at 8.54pm. The records further indicate that at 8.55pm the appellant called Mr Rafferty. The tower which picked up the call was located at the Carslaw Building close to the University of Sydney. The records also indicated that a further call was made by the appellant to Mr Rafferty at 10.44pm. The tower location which picked up the call was Regent Street, Chippendale.

28SM, who was DN's partner in 2003, gave evidence that DN provided drugs on ""Al's behalf"". She gave evidence that sometimes she would go to Circular Quay where they met Al who would supply DN with M&M containers containing drugs, and mobile phones. She was aware that Al was the deceased.

29She said that she and DN met with the deceased around 7.00pm on the evening of 2 May. She observed the deceased had a scooter. She heard the deceased making a phone call to someone saying he would be late. She said she recalled that DN gave the mobile phones he had back to the deceased.

30She said she went home and woke up in the early hours of the following morning around 2 or 3 o'clock. She said that Mr Rafferty and DN were there discussing heroin dealing.

31In cross-examination she agreed that DN and Mr Rafferty had discussed going into a drug dealing business together on a number of occasions. She also stated she rang DN from time to time on the drug phones.

32LM who was the partner of the deceased at the time of his death, gave evidence the deceased commenced to sell heroin in about March 2003. She said he used to buy it from the appellant whom she had met. She said the deceased first was into selling himself but as the business increased he employed two runners. She said that he used two mobile phones in the conduct of his business.

33LM said that the deceased told her that the appellant had a conversation with him (the deceased) in which the appellant was saying he wanted the SIM cards because the appellant had given the deceased a start in the business. She said the deceased did not want to give them to him but she believed that they had come to an arrangement whereby the appellant would have one and the deceased would keep the other.

34She said that on the day of the murder, the deceased left home at about 7.30am to drop off some heroin to his runners. He came home and he left again at about 4.00pm. She said he was carrying mini M&M containers which had the heroin, and a Nintendo Gameboy. He had the phones for his runners and probably his own phone.

35LM said she spoke to the deceased twice, possibly three times, and that the last time was at 8.30pm. She said the deceased had told her that Scott was running a bit late and he was going to be home later on. She said that by Scott he meant the appellant, Scott May, and that the deceased said he was going to meet the appellant at Rozelle, Balmain. 

36She said she woke up in the morning and rang the hospitals and Central Police Station and no one had heard of the deceased. She said at about 8.30am she received a call from the appellant asking where the deceased was and that he had not showed up last night.

37She said that a couple of days before the deceased's death, the deceased had told her that the appellant had said he wanted the ""big fella"" to come and work for him. She said the deceased was not very happy, but could not do much about it because the appellant had been asking for the SIM cards, and he, the deceased, wanted to keep on good relations with the appellant. She understood the ""big fella"" to be Steve (DN).

38She said that she did not speak to the appellant again until August. She said she told the appellant that he was the deceased's best mate. She said the appellant responded, ""But I'm not"". She said she told the appellant ""Well Andrew saw you that way. He saw you as a close mate, even though you were doing business together"". She said that the appellant told her that what he felt was different. He also said that they (the police) have ""got nothing on me, they can come and search my house, it's sweet"". 

39She said the deceased smoked Winfield Blue cigarettes.

40She said that when the deceased left home on the morning of 3 May 2003 he had the Gameboy and $16,000 to buy two ounces of heroin from the appellant.

41In cross-examination she agreed that DN had worked for the deceased pretty much regularly for some weeks. She agreed she made a statement to the police on 3 May 2003 and that in that statement she gave to the police three telephone numbers, one of which was used for the runner known as Steve (DN).

42She agreed that in that statement she told the police that the deceased got heroin from a person called ""Matey"". She agreed that she said in her statement that the reason he was called that was to ensure that if she was spoken to by the police she would not know his identity. She agreed that she said in her statement that she had never spoken to ""Matey"" on the phone. 

43She also agreed that in her statement of 3 May she said nothing about the appellant. She said she believed that the appellant and the deceased were friends.

44LM agreed that she made a further statement to the police on 5 May 2003. She agreed she said in that statement that on the evening of 30 April 2003 the deceased told her that he was going to meet the person ""Matey"" and said ""You know what? Matey thinks the SIM cards are his?"" and, ""we've had words. Nothing serious but I let him know he can own half"". 

45She agreed that in her statement of 5 May she said that on 1 May the deceased told her ""Matey"" wanted Steve (DN) to work for him.

46She said that from what the deceased told her the appellant wanted the deceased to have a four week break from selling drugs so either Steve (DN) or Sean (Mr Rafferty) could work for him.

47She said that in her statements of 3 and 5 May she did not hold anything back but referred to the appellant as ""Matey"". She agreed that she said ""Matey"", not Scott May, when she spoke to police on 7 May.

48She agreed she told police on 7 May that when she last saw the deceased on 2 May he had a large amount of cash with him, at least $8,000. She said she agreed she said $16,000 in her evidence but said she meant at least $8,000. 

49She agreed that the first time she told the police that she knew the appellant and that he was giving heroin to the deceased was on 9 May. She explained her early statements by saying that she was traumatised and out of her depth. She reiterated ""Matey"" was the appellant, Scott May, and said that in her earlier statements she did not want to point the finger at anyone. 

50Telephone records show that the deceased called LM at 7.59pm on the evening of 2 May and that she called the deceased's drug phone at 11.24am the next day in an attempt to locate him. The latter call is consistent with the evidence of Mr Rafferty to the Police Integrity Commission to the effect that he received a call from the deceased's wife on the morning of 3 May asking what had happened to him.

51The phone records referred to in the agreed chronology also show that the appellant called LM at 7.48pm on the evening of 3 May whilst LM was at The Rocks Police Station.

52A Mr Jamie Knipe gave evidence. He said he knew ""Al"". He said he broke into the window of an Audi vehicle at an underground carpark at Pyrmont and took a satchel bag. He said the bag had tablets in it which he gave to Al and received $3,000 in exchange. He said that some time later he gave the deceased a scooter. Subsequently in his evidence, he said that this occurred on 2 May.

53He said he tried to ring the deceased on 3 May but to no avail. He said he found out the deceased had been murdered on the Sunday.

54He agreed in cross-examination that he believed the pills were ecstasy tablets and he was worried about having them.

55A Mr David Herr gave evidence. He lived in the same premises as the deceased and LM. He said he was with LM on 2 May around 6.30pm. He said that after about an hour she received a call from the deceased saying that he was going to be late. 

56He said that LM told him the next morning that the deceased had not returned. He went to the city with her. Whilst there she rang the deceased's phone but spoke to someone else. He said that he and LM ended up at the Union Hotel at Paddington where he met a person who was introduced as Steve.

57Mr Herr said that the deceased had told him (he did not say when) that he (the deceased) had some ecstasy tablets.

58A Ms Maria Papageorgiou gave evidence. She indicated that in 2003 she was a user of heroin and that she had a number for a particular dealer. She said as a result of using the number she would meet persons known as Al, Steve, J and later Phil, in the city centre near Broadway. 

59She said she met Al, the deceased, twice. She learnt that he was killed within a few days of him being shot.

60Ms Papageorgiou said that the last time she had spoken to him before he was shot was on the Thursday or Friday when she asked him if he could wait round for her but he said he couldn't because he had to go and see his boss at Newtown.

61She said she continued to meet Steve (DN). She had been given a different number to contact him by phone a fortnight before the death of the deceased.

62The critical witness was Mr Ryan Burnes. Mr Burnes had pleaded guilty to the murder of the deceased and had been sentenced by Justice Fullerton.

63Mr Burnes gave evidence that he first met the appellant when he was 13, that they became friends and that he lived in the appellant's home when he was 15 for about two to three years. He said he regarded the appellant as his best mate. 

64Mr Burnes said he spent New Year's Eve 2002/2003 in the company of the appellant. They went to the Unity Hotel where an argument started and the appellant was king hit. He said the appellant was upset and he and the appellant with other persons left the hotel and went to the appellant's home at Alexandria/Erskineville. Mr Burnes stated he went to the appellant's bedroom where he saw a magazine, a gun clip from a magazine and a couple of bullets on the bed. He said that the appellant had hurt his thumbs in the fight so he helped him put the bullets in the magazine. He stated that the gun was a 1911 Colt and the bullets were of a small copper bronze shape with a marking 45ACP on the bottom.

65He stated that he continued to see the appellant in subsequent months. In April or May he stated the appellant came to his home and asked him whether he would do something for the appellant. He stated that the appellant asked ""if I would go all the way for him"". Mr Burnes said that the appellant was pretty agitated. He said that the appellant said he would ring the next day.

66Mr Burnes said he next spoke to the appellant the day after that whilst he was at his girlfriend's mother's house. He claimed the appellant said to him ""I will meet you out the front in about 10 minutes"". He said he met the appellant in the front at about 9.30pm and the appellant told him that they were going to pick someone up, referring to him as Matey. Mr Burnes said that the appellant told him to look under the seat and he did and felt a gun wrapped in a shirt. He said he leant forward and got it from under the seat and identified it as the same gun he saw on New Year's Eve.

67Mr Burnes said that the appellant said to him that ""If I say I am going back to get me wallet out of the car"" that was the signal to shoot.

68Mr Burnes said that he went with the appellant to Market Town, Leichhardt and saw the deceased. He said the deceased jumped into the front seat. He also said that the deceased had a scooter with him and two phones. 

69Mr Burnes said he did not listen to the conversation between the deceased and the appellant but they ended up at Callan Park. He said that everyone got out of the car and the appellant told the deceased to put all the phones and everything else into the car.

70Mr Burnes said that when he got the gun from under the seat he had placed it in the front of his pants and the gun was in the front of his pants when they got out of the car. He said that he did not hear the conversation that took place between the appellant and the deceased after they had got out of the car and whilst they were walking down the hill. He said it was normal until they stopped walking, after which there was a point where the conversation escalated and there was some sort of disagreement.

71He recalled the deceased pulling out a smoke and offering him one. He said the deceased was smoking with his left hand.

72Mr Burnes said that the appellant turned around and looked at him and said ""I am going back to the car to get my wallet"". Mr Burnes said he took that to mean to shoot. He said he shot the deceased. He said he pulled out the gun, unlocked the safety, shot him once and the deceased fell to the ground. Mr Burnes said he proceeded to walk away but he could hear him so he went back and stood over the top of him and shot him two more times. He said the gun was pointing straight down.

73He said that thereafter he ran up the hill, jumped into the car with the appellant and drove off. The appellant said something like ""I knew you would do it"".

74The appellant asked him if he wanted the phones and they were in the glove box. He said he opened the glove box and noticed there was two wads of money. Mr Burnes said he did not want the phones. There was a Gameboy there and he took the Gameboy and one of the wads of cash. He said he remembered the Gameboy was purple and there was about $4,000 worth of cash.

75He identified the cigarette that the deceased had offered him as a Winfield Blue.

76Mr Burnes was asked if he spoke to the appellant about what had occurred subsequently. He said the appellant cut him off and asked ""What are you talking about?"" 

77In cross-examination Mr Burnes stated that he understood he got a 25 percent discount on sentence for future assistance in relation to the prosecution of the appellant and that he was aware that if he did not give assistance he faced the prospect of his sentence being increased by a number of years. However, he denied it was the only reason he gave the evidence.

78In cross-examination he said he was in fact 14 when he first met the appellant. He denied he told his de facto wife that his mother left him as a toddler at a bus stop and the appellant's mother found him and took him home and raised him. 

79Mr Burnes agreed that from age 12 he had been a patient in psychiatric hospitals diagnosed as schizophrenic and had psychotic episodes on a regular basis. He said the last one was four or five years ago. He agreed that he said at the committal hearing that even in September 2007 he still heard voices in his head. He said he heard voices all the time but it did not necessarily mean he was psychotic. He stated that he was on anti-depressants but he stopped taking anti-psychotic medication a couple of months before the time when he gave his evidence. He agreed he had been on anti-psychotic medication from time to time since he was a teenager.

80Mr Burnes was cross-examined about conversations he had with a Dr Garside when he was a patient at a psychiatric institution, Redbank House. He stated that he did not recall telling Dr Garside that he had killed a number of people. He said he did not deny it but just could not recall it and said that if he had told Dr Garside that he, Mr Burnes, would have believed it to be true. He agreed he told Dr Garside he did not have any close friends at the age of 15.

81Mr Burnes said that when he was discharged from Redbank House he went to live with his godmother at Enmore. He occasionally stayed with his own mother.

82Mr Burnes agreed that he had some scars on his forearms from burn marks which he inflicted on himself. He said he did not recall telling Dr Garside that each one was for a past murder he committed. He subsequently denied he said that. He also said he did not recall telling Dr Garside that he had burnt down an entire school, although he did not deny he said it. He agreed he told Dr Garside that his father was killed in an accident and said the same thing to a friend of his, JM.

83Mr Burnes had a number of conversations with JM whilst JM was wearing a listening device. Mr Burnes acknowledged in his evidence that he was now aware that the conversations he had with JM were being recorded by the police.

84Mr Burnes agreed that one of the things he told JM was that his father in fact was not killed in a motor accident but he was someone who went by the name of Butchy Burnes who was one of the most notorious underworld characters in Sydney and was shot dead by Roger Rogerson. He stated he believed it to be true. He said that JM put the idea into his head and he believed it. Mr Burnes then said he was told it by other people, namely his aunties and uncles and that he knew that it was not rubbish.

85Mr Burnes agreed that in 2006 he told justice health workers he was having panic attacks on a daily basis. He remembered describing the voices he heard as a running commentary. He agreed that he may have told a justice health worker that he had a special relationship with God and was an instrument of God.

86Mr Burnes stated that he was admitted to psychiatric units because of schizophrenia not psychotic episodes. He was asked about a conversation he had with a Dr McClure in June 2006 and agreed that he told him he worried that he caused negative events, accidents and murders which were somehow related to him and were his fault.

87He agreed he told JM he shot a person at Rozelle Hospital and that he might have said it did not worry him because he had been killing people since he was 14. He stated, however, that he was clearly ""off my face"" at the time of making the statement. 

88Mr Burnes stated he did not recall telling JM he had a tattoo on his shoulder that said ""Hitman"" but agreed that he had one since 1995 or 1996.

89Mr Burnes agreed that from a young age he had used illicit drugs. He stated that he had smoked pot since he was 12 and that he was a regular consumer of cocaine, ice, heroin and benzodiazepam. However, he denied he went to Shellharbour Psychiatric Unit in 2005 because of his drug taking. Mr Burnes agreed that he told police that JM gave him copious amounts of drugs. He said he gave him drugs in February 2006 and that he was popping 20 ""benzoes"" pills a day.

90Mr Burnes was further cross-examined about various fantasies he had. He said that at one stage he believed his children were being eaten alive and that there was a time when he had real difficulty in telling the difference between reality and what was going on in his head.

91Mr Burnes agreed that he was interviewed by the police on 16 August 2006 at Surry Hills Police Station, the interview being with a Detective Morfoot and Detective McGregor. Mr Burnes agreed that he first told the police on that day that he was living at Nowra. He stated he was trying to deceive them. He also agreed he was trying to deceive them when he said he was living at Annandale. He stated that he did not want to bring the appellant into the interview. He said he was trying to keep the appellant out of the bad parts and to make the police think that he did not have any contact with the appellant after the murder of the deceased. He said there was some point in the interview when he decided to tell the truth. Mr Burnes also said he was not telling the police the truth when he claimed that because of the amount of drugs he pumped into his system, he had trouble remembering last week.

92Mr Burnes said that he and the appellant started using the drugs at the same time but the appellant had got off them. He said he was aware that the appellant had gone onto a methadone programme.

93Mr Burnes agreed he never said a word to the police about going to the appellant's apartment on New Year's Eve and finding a gun. He said that that was before he found out that the deceased had children. However, he agreed that at least six months before the interview he had been told by somebody, possibly JM, that the deceased had children.

94Mr Burnes insisted that he did not mention the gun because of his displaced sense of loyalty. He agreed that in early May 2003 he was using cocaine and heroin but that it was a bit of an exaggeration when he told the police that in May 2003 he was doing drugs every day. He agreed that what he told the police about his drug use was deceitful.

95Mr Burnes agreed that he was aware that there was nine years taken off his sentence for his agreement to give evidence against the appellant. He denied that he told ME, who is the girlfriend of JM, that his mother left him at a bus stop. However, he again said that he was left at the bus stop at the age of six and he went and lived with his godmother. Although he agreed he was living with his mother when he was about 12 or 13.

96He said when he first knew the appellant he only stayed at his house on an occasional basis. He agreed he never told any psychiatric institution or hospital that he lived with the appellant saying that he did not want to get them into any trouble by saying he lived there.

97Mr Burnes was further cross-examined on his conversations with JM. He agreed he told JM at the end of 2003 that he shot a person in Callan Park. He also agreed that in late 2003 he said to JM that someone was trying to set him up.

98In cross-examination he did say he discussed the murder with the appellant. He said the appellant told him he was getting a bit of heat from the coppers. He said that was a couple of months after the murder. He said it was after this conversation that the appellant said ""What are you talking about?"" whenever he brought up the murder. He said it was like saying ""Don't bring it up. Don't want to talk about it"".

99Mr Burnes was asked about a conversation he had with JM on 26 December 2003. He said he did not recall JM saying words to the effect ""Tell me what the fuck happened"" and him (Mr Burnes) saying ""One night I spoke to Scott on the phone and he picked me up in his car. We drove to Callan Park. I got out of the car, walked up to him and shot him. I aimed at him and shot him."" It was suggested to Mr Burnes that whilst he did that, he used both his hands as if he was firing a shotgun or a rifle. Mr Burnes subsequently stated that he did recall telling JM that he shot the deceased but he did not make any hand gestures.

100Mr Burnes agreed that it was fair to say that from September 2005 he felt resentment towards the appellant because he was able to get off drugs. He agreed it was fair to say he suffered from extreme paranoia at the time.

101Mr Burnes agreed that on 1 and 21 September 2005 he had lunch with JM at a hotel called ""Dick's Hotel"". He agreed that JM was suggesting to him that the appellant would be an informer to the police and that he (JM) was putting that idea into his head.

102He was then asked about a conversation with JM on 21 December 2005. He agreed that at that time he said to JM that he was a person of interest in relation to the investigation of the death of the deceased and that he asked JM ""Do you know the only one that can link it?"" and that JM said ""I think it's Scotty, and he will"".

103Mr Burnes agreed in that context that he was a person who, for many years, had suffered from extensive paranoia and that what JM said had the effect of him becoming quite concerned that the appellant would inform on him.

104Mr Burnes was asked about the meeting he had with JM on 13 February 2006. He denied that on that day he pointed out to JM where he shot the deceased. He said he was not in Callan Park on that day but on the other side of Iron Cove Bridge.

105Mr Burnes said he had heard of the deceased prior to him being shot in the context of him being someone who sold drugs. He stated he was pretty sure he met him in 2001 or2002. He said he was just a bloke named Al. He said that he met him just for five seconds through a car window. He agreed that he told the police in the first interview he had no recollection of seeing a scooter. This was amended in his second and third statements.

106Mr Burnes agreed that the first time he ever said anything to JM about there being a signal to kill the deceased was in the conversation of 13 February 2006. It was put to him he said the signal was ""I've got to go to get my wallet, all right, and that's for no, all right. If he said it, but he didn't say that. He started walking up the street so that was the go"". Mr Burnes said ""No, it would have been the other way around because going back to the car to get my wallet was the signal for the go"". When it was suggested to him that what was said was in the recording, Mr Burnes stated that he was probably confused when he said it.

107Mr Burnes agreed that to make the gun fire you would have to slide the barrel back to cock it and said he must have done so. He agreed he never mentioned to anybody about cocking the gun by sliding the barrel. He agreed he told JM ""I pulled it up, clicked the safety off, he's heard the click. He's gone to turn around like that. Boom through here. He went down and he's gasping, he's trying to say something but I don't remember what he said and then, fucking, I just walked over the top of him and just, fucking, boom, boom"". Mr Burnes said that what he said to JM was ""One in the neck, two in the chest"", bur he then said ""That's my style, bro. One in the head, two in the chest. I was trying to get him in the fucking head, bro, but as soon as he heard that safety clip off"". Mr Burnes said that he said that to JM because he was trying to impress him.

108He agreed he told JM that the deceased said ""Why? Why?"" after the first shot and that Mr Burnes then said ""sorry, bro, but boom boom"". He said that was the truth. He said he still had no recollection of walking through the grounds of Rozelle Hospital on 13 February 2006 with JM and he did not remember pointing out any area where he said the shooting of the deceased occurred. He agreed he told him that the first shot hit the deceased in the neck.

109He agreed that he told JM he still had the gun that shot the deceased and that was a lie which was ""pill driven"". He also said that when he told JM he had a 20 gauge shotgun which was his wife's and she liked the 45, it was all rubbish.

110He agreed he told JM he shot his first person when he was 14 and had shot eight people in total.

111Mr Burnes agreed that in April 2002 he used the appellant's name to pretend he was the appellant when arrested by the police. He said the police would have found out who it was the next day. 

112He was asked questions about a conversation he had with JM on 13 June, when JM had a Nintendo Gameboy. He agreed he said to JM ""Matey had one of these"", meaning the deceased and that he also said ""And, fucking, he had a scooter as well. Pranged the scooter. Mel wanted to give it to her daughter"" and that he told JM ""They reckon that was the missing link, the scooter, so we just fucked it off"".

113He agreed that he told the police in August 2006 that he had no recollection of the scooter.

114He also said he had no recollection of telling JM that he played the Gameboy for a couple of months and then took it to a ""hock shop"". He said he recalls saying he gave it to Mel (his girlfriend's) nephew.

115He agreed he said to JM in this conversation that he took the two phones. Immediately after that he said he did not remember saying he took the two phones but that there were two phones and that he did not take the two phones.

116Mr Burnes agreed he lied to JM when he said on 14 February 2006 he had ammunition for a 45. He said he was off his face on 14 February 2006.

117Mr Burnes agreed he never mentioned to police in his first interview that he had seen the gun previously. He said it in a statement a couple of weeks later. He agreed he said in his statement to the police of 16 August 2006 that he had never seen the gun before and that he said ""It was a handgun, I'm not sure what type"", and then ""I don't know I think it was a Colt"". He denied he was aware that 1911 was printed on the side of every Colt 45 type gun. He said that before the night of the deceased's murder he had never held a handgun before.

118He agreed that in his statement of 30 August 2006 to the police he stated he remembered seeing the gun at the appellant's place on New Year's Eve. He told the police that the appellant was wearing a shoulder holster on New Year's Eve. He agreed this was never mentioned in response to the Crown's questions.

119He stated that the version he gave to the police on 30 August 2006 was wrong. He said he saw the gun on New Year's Eve once in the bedroom when the appellant asked him to put the bullets into the clip and then he hid it. He said he had about five minutes to look at the gun, contrary to his evidence at the committal proceedings when he said he saw it for a few seconds.

120He agreed that he said to the prosecutor at the committal proceedings that he had seen a 45 prior to New Year's Eve, but said it was in shows and movies.

121He denied that the first time he said he had any discussion with the appellant concerning the murder was in his evidence, saying he remembered telling the police that. He was then asked further about his interview of 16 August where he told the detective that the appellant would say every time he approached him ""I don't know what you're talking about"". It was suggested to him he said something similar in the interview of 31 August 2006.

122Mr Burnes admitted that when he told the police that the appellant asked him to ""knock"" the deceased off and gave him details in his car the statement that they then ""stopped at a few placed, one of which was a shop to get a drink"" was dishonest. Mr Burnes said he said that because he had never done interviews and did not want to get anyone into trouble, he was very confused and very upset.

123He said his recollection was that it was a two-door hatchback he got into, however his statement to police said that he got into the passenger side back door. He said the person who took the statement down must have been confused when he referred to the back door.

124He agreed that in his interview of 30 August 2006 with the police he again said he got into the back passenger side door. He said that when he told the police in that interview ""We just stopped at a set of lights, a set of lights at an intersection, bloke jumped in the front"", he panicked, he wasn't being totally honest. He agreed that in the interview with the police he said he did not remember the route he drove to Callan Park. He said that all he remembered was getting picked up, stopping at Market Town and then going and parking at Rozelle.

125He agreed that in the interview of 30 August he said ""I don't remember shooting him. I don't even remember having a gun. I just had this feeling like I was going to die, I wasn't going to see anyone ever again"". He stated that when he said this he was attempting to be truthful with the police.

126He agreed he said to the police in the interview of 30 August ""One minute he was having a smoke and then he was just making these sounds"" and that he told the police that the appellant was in the car at the time. He said when he told the police the appellant was in the car at the time, he was not saying what he believed to be the truth because he was trying to block it out.

127He agreed he told the police that the appellant sped out of the hospital grounds.

128Mr Burnes reiterated that he got a call from the appellant at his partner's mother's house in Waterloo, and that it took place about ten minutes before he was picked up. He stated that the call came through on a landline.

129He said on the night of the murder he was wearing black tracksuit pants. He agreed that he said at the committal hearing that the black tracksuit pants did not have a drawstring in them and that he needed to use one of his hands to hold the pants up so they would not fall down.

130He stated he recollected holding the gun in his right hand. He agreed he stated at the committal hearing the gun stayed in his pants until he shot the deceased.

131He stated without the weight of the gun pushing down on his pants he did not need to pull them up and he kept them up by holding on to the gun. He stated that if he held on to the top of the butt his pants stayed as they were.

132Mr Burnes said he held the cigarette in his left hand while still holding the gun in his right hand in his pants. He said the deceased offered him a cigarette after the appellant said he was going back to the car to get his wallet. He said that when the deceased offered him a cigarette he was facing him and that he was right handed. He said that he still had the cigarette in his left hand when he shot the deceased.

133He agreed he told the Crown Prosecutor in a conference that he had one glove on and acknowledged that he had not given any evidence about that. He agreed he told the Crown Prosecutor that ""when I felt down the car for the gun that's when I put the gloves on"". He said he had another gun in his pocket and he did it because of fingerprints. He said he could not recall saying earlier that he had wiped down the gun but said he would have wiped it down because he had touched it with his ungloved hand.

134He reiterated that once he, the appellant and the deceased got out of the car the appellant said to the deceased ""leave phones and the money in the car"". He said they threw down their phones and the deceased put the money in the glove box.

135Mr Burnes said that he did not see him put the money in his glove box but he must have done so. He said he saw him throw the phones on the seat.

136He agreed that in the interview with the police on 16 August 2006 he told the police that he saw the deceased put money in the glove box but stated he did not actually see him put money in the glove box but he saw him put something in the glove box and throw his phones on the seat.

137He agreed he told the police in the interview of 16 August 2006 that he did not remember how many phones there were. He said he was not being truthful at that time. He said that it was all new to him, he was panicking, he was scared, he did not know what was going to happen. He said he was concerned because the SIM cards out of that phone were getting used the next day. He said he knew that was happening because he was with someone in the city when it occurred.

138He agreed that he told the police that after the murder the appellant gave him some money. It was a couple of thousand, about $5,000. He said that in saying that he was mistaken.

139He agreed that he told the police on 16 August that he did not remember the appellant taking the money out of the glove box but just remembered having it on him. He said he did not know what he meant when he said that.

140He was then asked further questions about his conversation with JM of 13 February 2006 when he told JM that he was going to be paid $40,000 in the next two weeks. He stated he thought he was in psychosis and he was just putting on a front for JM. He agreed that he told the police that it was not true he was going to receive $40,000.

141He agreed that when he told the police on 16 August that he did not take anything of the deceased's he understood that they were suggesting that a Nintendo and Super Mario game had been pawned in the name of his girlfriend. He stated he held back because he was being dishonest. He said he was confused and very shocked.

142Mr Burnes agreed that the police conducted a further interview on 18 January 2007. He agreed that on that day he gave the police a different version of events telling the police the shooting of the deceased was something he did off his own back and nothing to do with the appellant. On that occasion he agreed he told the police the appellant did not say ""we got to kill this bloke"" but rather ""we've got to sort it out. Sort it out meaning, we got to talk to him... had to convince him"". He said he was only there to backup the appellant. He agreed that he told the police in that interview that the conversation about a signal was ""all bullshit... that was just confusion"". He said he misconstrued the appellant saying ""going back to the car"" as a signal. 

143He explained that what he said in that interview was all out of misplaced loyalty. He decided to save the appellant. He decided to lie through his teeth.

144He agreed he told the police that the last words the appellant said were ""I'm going back to the car to get my wallet brother"" and that that was the last real thing the appellant had to do with the situation. He agreed he told the police he then started to talk to the deceased and he came across all wrong. He said ""We [the deceased and Mr Burnes] raised our voices, the deceased started having a smoke and turned his back on me"". Mr Burnes told the police that he said ""'Don't turn your back on me' and when he turned around he had his hand in his pocket and then bang I shot him"". He agreed he told the police that as soon as he said ""Don't turn your fucking back on me"" the deceased turned around and he was expecting the deceased to swing a punch. He agreed he told the police the deceased came around with his hand in his pocket and ""I jumped back and shot him"". He agreed he told the police he could hear the deceased gurgling and gasping. He said it was all weird in his mind. He agreed he told the police that when he heard the gurgling it dawned on him that he had shot the deceased. He agreed he told the police that it dawned on him that if it was him on the ground he would not want to be lying there bleeding out and gurgling and he would want it finished.

145Mr Burnes said he gave this version of events out of a misplaced sense of loyalty to the appellant.

146Mr Burnes was then asked about an interview he had with a psychiatrist, Dr Westmore, on 16 March 2007. He agreed that he told Dr Westmore the truth of what happened to the best of his knowledge. He agreed he told Dr Westmore that the appellant approached him about two days before the murder and told him that he (the appellant) was in a bad situation that he could not get out of and the appellant asked him if he could sort things out. He said he understood the appellant to mean ""Talk to the bloke, tell him to back up"".

147Mr Burnes agreed he told Dr Westmore he could not remember all the specific details of what occurred because he was ""coked up and popping pills to calm down"". However, he told Dr Westmore that the deceased and the appellant were talking nicely at first but then they started arguing. He said that the appellant then gave the deceased a ""look, sort him out, talk to him"".

148He agreed that he then told Dr Westmore that he and the deceased commenced to argue. He stated that although he told Dr Westmore that, it was in fact untrue. They had never had an argument but rather the appellant and the deceased had argued.

149He agreed that he told Dr Westmore that the deceased said ""to mind your own business"" and that he and Mr Burnes became agitated but later he had a cigarette with the deceased to try and settle him down. He acknowledged that was not the truth although they had a cigarette. He said he did not recall telling Dr Westmore that he had a gun with him, but he was not disputing it. He agreed that what he said to Dr Westmore is that all he knew of the deceased was that he was a big drug dealer, ""he was abusing me and going off at me. He had his hand in his pocket and I shot him"".

150He agreed that there was no point in trying to deceive Dr Westmore.

151Mr Burnes was then asked about the evidence he gave on sentencing before Justice Fullerton. He agreed he told her Honour that the deceased ""brushed me off. Like he's [the deceased] giving me the sign, like, as if fuck off, you don't know what you're talking about, and he's turned around like that and then I sort of - sort of, like, went to grab him to say, like, don't turn your fucking back on me, you know what I mean, like"". He also agreed he said in his evidence before Justice Fullerton that the deceased had his hand in his pocket which frightened him. He said he was paranoid and scared.

152Mr Burnes said it was the truth when he told the Crown Prosecutor at the sentencing hearing that he got angry with the deceased but said ""that was after I got the order to shoot. I wasn't going to shoot him in the back"".

153Mr Burnes went on to say ""I said sorry when I shot him"". It was suggested to him that he had never said that before and he said that he had.

154Mr Burnes agreed he told the Crown Prosecutor at the sentencing hearing he expected to find a weapon under the seat of the car but did not know what it was going to be until he picked it up.

155Mr Burnes then reiterated that if he did not get a signal he was not going to shoot the deceased. He said ""It was never one hundred percent certain me jumping in that car that someone was going to die that night"". He said he had no idea who he and the appellant were going to meet and why they were going to meet them. He said all he knew was what he was being told to do.

156Mr Burnes went on to say that on the night of the murder he went with a man called Ivan to Redfern and bought drugs. He agreed that it was the first time he had said this but said no one had ever asked him before. He said that out of the $4,000 he took he gave the appellant $1,000 to mind for him because he knew he would spend it. He agreed he never gave that evidence previously.

157Mr Burnes gave evidence that a week or two after the murder he and his de facto wife moved to Annandale and it was there the appellant came round and they had a chat about the whole thing and then after that it was never mentioned again. He agreed he had never given that evidence before. 

158Mr Burnes agreed that sometimes he had trouble saying what he meant and that he accepted at the committal hearing that when he was young he had trouble identifying fact from fantasy. He said that he still hears voices to this day and that he sometimes heard them in the witness box. He agreed it was true when he told the police in September 2007 that he really could not remember what happened on 2 May 2003 but said he remembered now because he was made to remember. He agreed that he thought on the day that the deceased might kill him.

159Mr Burnes also agreed that he read certain things about the murder and heard about them on the street prior to speaking to JM or the police speaking to him.

160Finally in cross-examination it was put to Mr Burnes that he did not shoot the deceased at all but just told JM he did to big note himself. He denied this. It was then suggested to him that if he did shoot the deceased the appellant was not there and he replied ""Bloody oath he was"". In re-examination Mr Burnes said that during the conversation at Annandale the appellant said for him to ""keep his mouth shut"" as he (the appellant) had just been ""pulled over by some copper"".

161In re-examination leave was given under s 108 of the Evidence Act 1995 to put prior consistent statements to Mr Burnes. In that context he was referred to his statement of 30 August 2006 in which he made the following statement:

""I've gone into the room and Scottie's sitting on the end of the bed. I sat down next to him. He was trying to put some bullets into a clip. By clip I mean the clip that goes in a gun. He was holding the clip in his left hand and his thumb was straight. I saw the clip was black and bullets were like brass or copper coloured. ... He said: 'put these in'.

When I was doing that I saw on the back of the bullet on the flat bottom bit it said 45 ACP.""

Mr Burnes also said in that statement he felt the gun under the bed and looked at it closely. ""It had like a long barrel. It had a hammer at the end of it. There was no clip inside it. I put the clip I had with the two bullets in it into the handle"".

162Mr Burnes was also referred to his statement of 30 August when he said he remembered the car was a hatch. He stated that when he said in that statement he fired at a horizontal angle when the deceased was on the ground, he meant ""straight down"", and later agreed that this was vertical. 

163He was also referred to his statement of 31 August 2006 where he said he held the gun so that it was pointing at the deceased downwards, still in his right hand. ""I looked at his face and saw his eyes open and said: 'Sorry bro'. I pulled the trigger and heard two more bangs"". Mr Burnes said that was the truth.

164Mr Burnes was also referred to his interview of 16 August 2006 where he said he did not stop anywhere else but Callan Park and said that was true. Finally Mr Burnes was referred to his 30 August 2006 statement where he said he heard a phone call and the appellant said ""Meet you out the front in ten minutes"". He stated that was true.

165A medical record from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in relation to attendance by the appellant on 1 January 2003 with a cut lip and pain in his thumb was tendered.

166There was no record of any phone call from the appellant to Mr Burnes around 9.00 or 9.30pm on the evening of 2 May. However, on the following day between 5.39pm and 6.47pm there were four unsuccessful attempts made to call the appellant from a phone booth on Elizabeth Street, very near where Mr Burnes was then living. That was the booth from which the appellant had sought to call LM.

167JM was then called to give evidence. He stated that he first met the appellant when the appellant was 10 and he was 13 or 14. He said he did not meet Mr Burnes until 2003 or 2004.

168JM said he saw the appellant in company with Mr Burnes and that he (JM) and Mr Burnes smoked cannabis together.

169JM said Mr Burnes told him that he was the person who shot the deceased at Callan Park. JM said he responded that he did not want to hear anything about it and wanted nothing to do with it. JM claims Mr Burnes said ""he wanted me to more or less try and get people to put the bounce on Scott to get money out of him, and I said I didn't want nothing to do with it"". JM said Mr Burnes claimed he had been ripped off.

170JM said that on Christmas Day 2003 he had lunch with Mr Burnes and their respective girlfriends. He said he recalls watching the movie ""Blue Murder"" and Mr Burnes said the gun in the show was the same type of gun he used at Callan Park.

171JM said he saw Mr Burnes the day after Christmas Day but he did not mention the appellant. JM said Mr Burnes had already mentioned the appellant and every time he brought it up he (JM) cut him off.

172JM stated that Mr Burnes told him the appellant drove him (Mr Burnes) into Callan Park and the appellant ""left something or grabbed something out of the car, and shoot, shoot Andrew Heavens"". JM said that Mr Burnes told him the appellant picked him up and took the gun off him.

173JM said Mr Burnes told him he was picked up in a car from Balmain and was driven to Callan Park.

174JM said that he agreed to co-operate with police by wearing a concealed listening device when conversing with Mr Burnes. In cross-examination JM agreed that when he was an inmate at Silverwater Metropolitan Regional Remand Centre he told a police officer he was sick of Mr Burnes bragging about it. He said he first took Mr Burnes as a ""bullshitter"". He said Mr Burnes had told him his father was a man called Butchy Burnes who had been shot dead by Roger Rogerson.

175JM agreed that he sold drugs to Mr Burnes from time to time.

176JM was cross-examined on his first statement to the police of 17 March 2005. He agreed that in that statement he said that on Boxing Day of the previous year Mr Burnes said to him ""I've spoken to Scott. Everything's been sorted out"". He agreed he said ""What are you talking about?"" and Mr Burnes said ""The money they owe me"". JM added that Mr Burnes said he was fixed up with some kids' clothes and stuff like that, and never mentioned any money.

177JM was referred to his statement to the police which recorded that Mr Burnes had told him there was a motorised scooter which was taken from the deceased, kept by somebody and was seized by the police in a raid. He stated that the person in question was not the appellant.

178JM agreed that he met Mr Burnes at ""Dicks Hotel"" on 1 September 2005 and on 21 December 2005. He said he also met him on 13 February 2006 when he and Mr Burnes ended up going to fish underneath the Iron Cove Bridge.

179He agreed that on those occasions he was fitted with a listening device.

180JM said on 13 February 2006 he and Mr Burnes walked from his house at Petersham, along Balmain Road and into the grounds of Rozelle Psychiatric Hospital. He said that Mr Burnes said before they reached the park ""Do you want me to show you where it happened?"" He said that Mr Burnes pointed to a place where he said he killed the deceased.

181JM agreed that on 13 February 2006 Mr Burnes said something about a signal he was given by the appellant in relation to the shooting of the deceased. He agreed that Mr Burnes told him that if the appellant said he was going to get his wallet that all was okay but that if he did not say that then that was the go to shoot him. JM also agreed that Mr Burnes told him that he still had the gun with which he shot the deceased but that he did not recall him saying that his girlfriend liked the gun.

182JM agreed that Mr Burnes had told him that he burnt himself to say he had killed some people and that he had been dumped by his mother at a bus shelter and raised by the appellant's mother.

183JM was shown a DVD recording of an occasion when he was with detectives showing them where he and Mr Burnes had walked through the hospital grounds and where he had indicated certain things to them. He confirmed that what he told the police on that day was the truth in terms of what Mr Burnes had told him.

184Following this evidence the Crown was given leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine JM. In that cross-examination JM gave evidence that Mr Burnes told him he moved the body the same night after he shot the person within a minute or two of the shooting taking place. JM then agreed that the deceased never actually said that but said he shot him in one place, then pointed to another place within a couple of minutes. He agreed there was nothing about this in the recorded conversations. He said there were other conversations he had had with Mr Burnes which were not on tape.

185JM agreed he made a statement on 20 February 2006 containing an account of the fishing trip. He agreed that he said in his statement: ""Ryan talked to me about something to do with the signal that Scotty had given Ryan to do it. Ryan said that the signal that Scotty gave to him was something to do with his wallet"".

186JM affirmed that the following part of his statement was pretty accurate:

""Ryan told me that when the guy heard the click of the gun he turned his head towards Ryan, and Ryan missed his head and shot him near the throat or neck. I said something to him about whether or not the guy he'd shot was gasping or gurgling. Ryan then said 'nuh', and something about the guy trying to talk. I asked him: 'What did he say?' Ryan said that he couldn't talk, but he thought he was trying to say: 'Why?' Ryan said something about the guy falling to the ground, and he then walked as if he, as if re-living what had happened around an imaginary spot on the ground. Ryan appeared to lean forward and with one of his hands pointed at the ground with two fingers extended in the face - in the shape of a gun and said something similar to: 'Bang, bang, two in the chest.'""

187JM agreed that Mr Burnes said nothing about a second spot and nothing about moving a body or dumping a body, during the walk down to the fishing spot. JM said that he could not remember whether that in fact was said or not. He agreed there was nothing about it in his statements and he could not recall any untaped conversations in which Mr Burnes told him about moving the body.

188ME was called. She gave evidence that in 2003 she was in a relationship with JM and that towards the end of 2003 she met Ryan Burnes and his girlfriend Melissa Riley. 

189She recalled Mr Burnes and Ms Riley talking about a person named Scott. Mr Burnes sometimes referred to him as being his brother.

190ME stated that at some point when Mr Burnes was at her house, she understood from a conversation that she overheard that Mr Burnes claimed to have killed a person at Callan Park and that he still had the gun. She remembered hearing that his girlfriend Melissa Riley liked the gun.

191ME stated that when Mr Burnes and Melissa Riley came round after Christmas 2003 they appeared to be smashed on drugs. 

192The next witness called was a Mr John Collins. He was a heroin user who knew a dealer by the name of Al. He did not know him by any other name. 

193Mr Collins agreed he commenced to work for Al. He met him at Circular Quay where he gave Mr Collins drugs in an M&M container which he sold for Al.

194He met another man doing the same thing whose name was Steve.

195Mr Collins said that Al gave him a phone to use. He also noticed that Steve had a mobile phone. He stated that Al gave him the phone at 7am and he would hand it back to him at 8pm at night with the money and the unsold drugs. 

196On Saturday 3 May 2003, Mr Collins went to Circular Quay and waited. Al did not turn up so he rang the mobile phone he was usually given. He said someone answered and stated ""This is not Al's business any more"".

197Mr Collins said that he saw Steve on the street about a week later selling heroin. In cross-examination he agreed he subsequently learned that the person he knew as Al was Andrew Heavens.

198In cross-examination Mr Collins agreed he worked as a runner for Al for ten days straight until the Friday he had the day off which was the day before he found out that Al had died. He agreed that before working for him he went to Circular Quay and met Al and met Steve as well who was with his girlfriend. He agreed that Steve asked him ""What are you doing here?"" and that he, Mr Collins, replied ""I am here as Al's runner"" and Steve said ""Well, so am I"". He agreed that Al said he would pay ""$350 a day cash and $200 worth of gear"".

199Mr Collins stated that while he was working for the deceased, the deceased told him he had bought 5,300 tablets of ecstasy from a street kid named Jamie. He did not say when exactly he obtained that ecstasy, or from whom they were stolen.

200Mr Collins also gave evidence that a few days before Al's death, Al told him that Steve was only going to be working for him for a couple more days, and then he was going to be working for someone else. He agreed that he said to Steve after the deceased's death: ""The cops will find out who's done it."" His recollection was that Steve said he had nothing to do with it.

201Melissa Riley, the partner of Ryan Burnes at the time, was called to give evidence. She said she knew the appellant and his partner, Selina. She said that Mr Burnes did not talk about the appellant very much.

202She said that she remembered going to a pub on New Year's Eve 2002 and that someone hit the appellant and that Mr Burnes hit that person.

203Ms Riley agreed that around the start of 2003 she and Mr Burnes lived with her mother at Waterloo. She denied remembering seeing a Nintendo Gameboy at the home and denied taking it to a local pawnshop and pawning it. She identified photocopies of her Centrelink card and Medibank card but repeated she did not pawn the Gameboy.

204She agreed in cross-examination that she was asked whether she recognised the signature on pieces of paper apparently used to pawn the Gameboy and she stated she did not. She agreed she told Detective McGregor that someone may have taken her cards.

205Detective Sergeant Kerfoot attended the crime scene. He gave evidence that that afternoon he met LM with Mr Herr. He heard LM take a phone call and say ""Hi Scott. Scott, no, he's dead. Scott, he's dead. They found him at Callan Park"". Detective Sergeant Kerfoot said that he did not tell LM how the deceased had been killed.

206Detective Sergeant Kerfoot stated he searched the Manly apartment shared by Mr Burnes and LM with LM's consent. He recalled LM saying that the person Scott she had been speaking to was a really close friend of Andrew. She said that Scott and his partner had recently moved to the Leichhardt area.

207Detective Sergeant Kerfoot said that LM told him that the deceased was using two runners, persons named Steve and Shane Bourke. He said she told him that the deceased was getting heroin from a person called ""Matey"" but she never knew who ""Matey"" was.

208A statement obtained from the appellant on 7 May 2003 was read to the jury. So far as relevant it stated as follows:

""I first met Andrew Heavens about a year and a half ago. We first met at Clinic 36 which is in Regent Street, Chippendale. This is a Methadone Clinic. ...

I know that Andrew lived with his girlfriend [LM] in Manly before he died. I have never been to their place in Manly. Before that he used to live in Annandale on Booth Street, just up the road from me where I lived in the Annandale Lodge on Johnson Street.

I used to see Andrew two or three times a week, sometimes more. That was usually at the clinic. ...

The last time I saw Andrew was last Wednesday night, 30 April 2003. Earlier that day at the clinic I had spoken to Andrew about getting some State of Origin tickets off him. We arranged to meet later that night at Newtown. No price had been mentioned at this time. He wasn't sure what price or how many he could get, what seats they were, et cetera.

I met Andrew that night at Newtown around 6 to 7pm. We met near the RPA Hospital near a little reserve on the main road. He had about half a dozen tickets on him. He wanted $150 for each general admission ticket. I only wanted two ... but the price was too much for me. ...

Andrew did ring me after that, but not until Friday 2 May 2003. He rang on my mobile phone about 5pm. I was at home. He said: 'Mate, I need to catch up with you I need to have a chat'. I said: 'Yep, no worries. I can't see you until about 8.30pm tonight at the markets'. He said: 'No worries'. That was the end of the call. Andrew never mentioned what he wanted to see me about. ...

The markets are the fruit markets next to Leichhardt Market Town. ... I left home alone about 8.15pm and drove to the markets. On the way Andrew called me as I was running late. I was meant to be there at 8.30pm. Andrew said: 'How far are you?' I said: 'I'll be there soon.' He hung up. I got there about five to ten minutes later and Andrew wasn't there. It was my understanding that Andrew was going to be there by himself ... I waited for him for about five minutes but he wasn't there. I drove around the block around the shopping centre a couple of times looking for him ... Before I left I rang him once on the mobile but his phone came back as uncontactable. This could have meant there was no reception. I then drove straight back home and got there around 9.15pm. I didn't try calling him again. ...

The next day Saturday 3 May 2003, I called Andrew on his mobile phone about lunchtime. The phone came back with the same message as the night before, that it was uncontactable. ... I hadn't heard from Andrew all day so I called [LM], his girlfriend, on her mobile phone. That was after dark, sometime after dinner. I said: 'Can I speak to Drew?'. She said: 'I'm at the police station because Drew's been murdered'. I said: 'No, you're joking, are you all right?'. She said: 'I'm in the middle of talking to the police'. I said 'Well, you've got my number call me'. I then hung up.

[LM] hadn't rung me back since then ...

About a month ago I heard on the street from a bloke named Craig at Clinic 36 that Andrew had either bought or got a big bag of Ecstasy tablets off some junkie who had broken into a car and found these tablets and stolen them. I don't know where or when this was supposed to have happened. I didn't hear any price paid for these.

I have also heard that Andrew was involved with some heavy people. By heavy I mean connected criminally. That is all I can think of.""

209Detective Sergeant O'Keefe gave evidence that he executed a search warrant at premises in Rosebery which he understood to be where Mr Rafferty lived. He found one Siemens brand mobile phone with an IMEI number of 3[XXXXXXXXXXXX]5.

210A statement of Mr Stephen Pitty was read. He said he lived near Rozelle Hospital. He heard what he interpreted to be gunshots and went outside and saw a car travelling at a speed faster than normal. He said it was within 30 seconds of the shooting. The car was plain white in colour, a four door hatch. He saw three persons in the car. The two in front were definitely male. He was not sure about the person in the rear.

211A Detective Senior Constable Glen Morfoot gave evidence. He stated that on 16 June 2003 LM gave him a proof shot containing some photographic images and she told him that those images were photographs of the appellant, Mr May. He said she told him that the person depicted in those photographs was the person in the earlier statement she had referred to as ""Matey"".

212She identified a person called Selina as being with the appellant in some of those photographs.

213Detective Morfoot said he executed a search warrant on an entity called Fast Money in Redfern in relation to a Nintendo Gameboy. He stated that four documents were seized and he identified them as pawn slips relating to a Gameboy and Super Mario game in the name of Melissa Riley. They were pawned on 15 May and 14 June 2003.

214Detective Morfoot stated that the person who pawned them provided identification by way of a Centrelink card and Medicare card. Those cards in the name of Melissa Riley were subsequently located by police and photographed. The pawnbroker documents were submitted to an expert along with specimens of Ms Riley's signature. The handwriting expert said it was likely but not certain that the signature on the pawnbroker documents was that of Ms Riley.

215Detective Morfoot gave evidence that the following matters relevant to the murder were not the subject of any public statement. First, the calibre of the ammunition used. Second, the fact that the bullets could have been fired by a 1911 model 45 calibre Colt handgun. Third, that the deceased was shot once in the left shoulder area and twice while lying on the ground. Fourth, that the deceased when found had his right hand in his jacket pocket, that a cigarette butt was found in the left hand of the deceased with some ash still attached when the police initially got there and that a packet of Winfield Blue cigarettes was found on the deceased.

216Detective Morfoot also gave evidence that on 23 July 2003 a listening device was placed at the premises then occupied by the appellant and his de facto wife Selina Markos. An extract of a recording of 7 August 2003 was tendered in which the following statements were made:

""... I've already made a fucken statement, you know what I mean, I'm just fucken you know, like just fuck off, I've done what I fucken had to do for youse mate, you know. I wish I hadn't even done it now, you know what I mean? (indecipherable) hassle me ...

I haven't fucked up, you know what I mean, but I just fucked up by making a statement ...""

217Detective Morfoot gave evidence that on 13 June 2006 the appellant and Mr Burnes were placed in a room at Parramatta Police Station and their conversation was monitored. An extract of what was recorded was tendered in evidence. In the course of it the appellant is recorded as saying that Mr Rafferty had ""buckled ... He was talking shit, mate. About this, a bit of this, a bit of that, you know what I mean?"" He was also recorded as saying that Mr Rafferty was ""starting rumours ... People just have to keep their mouth shut"". It also records the appellant saying that Mr Rafferty ""caused me much fucken headaches and drama and shit for me that I've got nothing to do with"".

218Detective Morfoot also gave evidence that all that was found at the search of the scene was a body located at a particular place, cartridges near to it, and three bullets, two of which were immediately underneath the body of Mr Heavens or where his body had been and one which was nearby.

219Detective Morfoot also said that, from the information he had received from sources, a scooter the deceased had on him on the night of his death was not motorised.

220Detective Senior Constable McGregor gave evidence. She stated the first volume of the brief of evidence was served on Mr Burnes' legal representatives on 17 October 2006. 

Ground 2 of the Notice of Appeal

221It is convenient to deal first with the second ground of appeal, namely, that the directions (both in writing and orally) given on the question of extended joint criminal enterprise were incorrect and occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

The submissions leading to the directions on joint criminal enterprise

222In his opening address, the Crown made the following remarks in relation to the charge of murder against the appellant:

""You will see, members of the Jury, that the first charge says that Mr May, on 2 May 2003, did murder Andrew Heavens. The prosecution case, on that charge, is not that Mr May actually personally killed Mr Heavens, rather, the charge is that he caused another man, Ryan Burnes, to kill Mr Heavens. He asked Mr Burnes to do it, encouraged Mr Burnes to do it, he took Mr Burnes to the place where the murder occurred and he provided him with the firearm which Mr Burnes used to do the killing. That, in a very brief one-liner, is the prosecution case on the first charge.""

223The accused was also charged in the alternative of being an accessory to the murder. The Crown in opening explained that charge in the following fashion:

""The possibility which the second charge relates to is that, if you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Burnes was acting at the request or direction of Mr May when he killed him but was possibly acting for some motive of his own, independent of any command or request by the accused when he killed the deceased. But knowing that, Mr May then still drove him away from the scene of the murder to protect Mr Burnes from getting caught for the murder.

So it is an act of assistance to a murderer to escape the consequences of what he did. That is the alternative charge. You would only go to that alternative charge if you were not satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that it was actually Mr May who, to use a shorthand word for it, commissioned the murder but you were satisfied that he was there, he was present and he drove Mr Burnes away.""

224Prior to closing addresses and the trial judge's summing-up, there was extensive discussion between the Crown, counsel for the appellant and the trial judge, as to the appropriate form of directions to be given. Although not ultimately relevant to the determination of the validity of the jury directions, the exchange illuminates the nature of the difficulty in this case. 

225In that context the Crown initially said (T969) that if the jury thought that what Mr Burnes said was substantially true but that he had misunderstood the signal, the accused would not be guilty of murder. However, on the following day the Crown changed its position. In that context the following exchange occurred (from T972):

""HIS HONOUR: My understanding of the way in which you were putting the case against Mr May in relation to the first charge, forget the second charge, is that, if you like, there was a common purpose, that is, a joint criminal enterprise between Mr May and Mr Burnes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Have I got that wrong?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No. That's correct.

HIS HONOUR: You are not suggesting accessorial liability for murder in that sense on the first charge?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No. They were engaged in a joint enterprise.

HIS HONOUR: So that would mean even if Mr Burnes was, say, for example, by reason of mental defect not guilty of murder, Mr May would be?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: I am raising that only hypothetically. It was the discussion about the first degree and second degree that caused me-

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No. It was a little beside the point. The better way to put it, they are engaged in a joint criminal enterprise.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: What I said to your Honour yesterday about what might happen if the jury thought that Mr Burnes may have misunderstood the signal and gone ahead and shot-

HIS HONOUR: I was going to come to that.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: --Mr Heavens, despite a negative signal, I will have to revise what I have said. It is the Crown case, even if that is the case, that Mr May would still be guilty of murder.

HIS HONOUR: Because it was a possible outcome from the joint criminal enterprise.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. Exactly.

HIS HONOUR: Doesn't that mean on the facts before the Court now that the alternate charge could never be found?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: It could only be found if the jury drew from those facts that Mr May had nothing to do with the murder of Mr Burnes, that is, hadn't provided the gun, hadn't encouraged, had no foreknowledge of its prospect, but nonetheless was present and knowing that Mr Burnes had murdered the deceased threw them away. That is an unlikely path, unlikely to the point of--

HIS HONOUR: Almost not being available.

226Thereafter the Crown put its closing address to the jury, during which the following remarks were made (T977):

""I am going to explain the basis upon which, that is, the theoretical or legal basis upon which, we say the accused, Mr May, is guilty of murder. You don't have to actually pull the trigger to kill somebody to be guilty of the crime of murder.

If you supplied to the killer, for example, the firearm knowing that the killer is going to use it to kill, or expecting that he will; if you drive the killer to the scene of the killing knowing, or expecting, that the killer may kill somebody there; if you ask the killer to kill on your behalf and therefore does so, then you are guilty of murder just the same as you pulled the trigger that kills the victim. That is the basis upon which the Crown says that Mr May is guilty of murder. He combined with Mr Burnes in an enterprise which at least had as a possible consequence, at least, that Andrew Heavens would be killed.

The Crown's primary case is to you that the very object of the enterprise was the murder of Andrew Heavens, but it is sufficient if you find from these circumstances that Mr Burnes killed Andrew Heavens and that Mr May recognised, or contemplated, that as a possible consequence of the enterprise they were engaged in. But, in reality, the Crown case is it was Mr May's intention all along that if Heavens did not accede, did not agree to what May wanted from him, that he would be killed.""

And later (T985):

""Now Mr Burnes' evidence is that prior to arriving at Callan Park, prior to Mr Heavens getting in the car, he had been told that he was to shoot Mr Heavens if he gave a particular signal, and the signal as he described was:

'If I say I'm going back to the car to get my wallet, then you do it.'

Now that is exactly what happened. Mr May gave the signal, he said:

'I am going back to the car to get my wallet.'""

227The Crown dealt with the second charge in the following manner (T1005):

""However, in the theoretical event that you do find the accused not guilty of murder you then consider the second charge.

It is, essentially, that Mr May, even though not guilty of involvement in the murder was nonetheless present for some reason and assisted Mr Burnes to get away from the scene after the murder. That's the essence of the second charge.

It is a charge which you are unlikely to consider because I suggest you would be unlikely to come to a conclusion that that factual scenario actually occurred. It is just there in the unlikely eventuality that you think, yes, Mr May was there but he didn't encourage the murder, he was simply there. Mr Burnes murdered the deceased for his own purposes, not to do with Mr May and then Mr May drove him away.""

228Subsequently (T1036), the trial judge provided proposed written directions with regard to murder and gave them to the parties. Counsel for the defence informed the trial judge that he had no matters to raise in relation to the written directions the judge proposed to give.

229There were further discussions as to the appropriate direction to be given to take account of the consequences if the jury found Mr Burnes got the signal mixed up. In that context, his Honour made the following remarks (T1093-1094):

""Leaving aside the manner in which one comes to that conclusion, it seems to me that the issue of the mistake in the signal basis as you have raised it, some factual issues [sic]. That is this: If the jury came to the view it was all agreed beforehand but were not satisfied that he got the signal right and he shot him in circumstances where Mr May by this stage, though found was involved, had said not to shoot him then the factual question is, is that a crime - truncated, contemplated by the agreement.

...

On the other alternative, it may be that they could take the factual view that the signal, if it was not to shoot, was in the context of this factual finding that they are making, a withdrawal from the joint common enterprise - from the common enterprise.

That's why I think it's necessary to put paragraph 4 [of the directions] in.""

230The Crown Prosecutor rejected the proposition that the concept of withdrawal could arise in this case. The trial judge, however, expressed the following view:

""That's normally if it goes ahead as originally contemplated and 5 people rob a bank and one of them withdrawals [sic] it has to be communicated to the other participants. And, secondly, you have to then prevent it occurring because you are held by your original agreement.

In this case, where he is ordering the murder, and gives a signal that says 'don't murder', he is communicating a withdrawal from the agreement to murder, and in the circumstances taking steps to - I hesitate to say, ensure - but to prevent the murder occurring.""

231During the course of the discussion the Crown indicated reluctance to embrace the extended joint criminal enterprise area of liability because a difficulty would arise as to the foundational crime. The discussion which took place on this issue between the trial judge and the Crown (at T1127), while not ultimately relevant to the validity of the jury directions, is illuminating of the reasons the directions took the form they did:

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: It is not a case of extended joint criminal enterprise in which they had embarked upon some other object and the killing of the deceased was an incident of that object. In my submission what has arisen is an evidentiary question, that is, would the jury be satisfied, given the prior different description of the signal, that a positive signal had indeed been given? That's the issue that arises.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: What in my submission the jury should be told in your Honour's oral directions is that the Crown relies on the following facts in proof of a joint criminal enterprise, that is, a mutual intention that Heavens should be killed: 

Firstly, the overture by the accused in the days prior to the murder asking Burnes would he be prepared to go all the way. Secondly, picking up Burnes on the evening of the murder. Thirdly, supplying him with a loaded firearm. Fourthly, putting him in a position with the deceased which was in a dark and secluded place. Fifthly - and these are all evidentiary matters - fifthly, saying to Burnes, or rather leaving the scene and at the same time saying: 'I'm going back to get my wallet.' Sixthly, exhibiting his apparent satisfaction of what Burnes had done by saying: 'I knew you'd do it, you're a mad cunt.'

It is from those six essential facts that the Crown seeks the jury to draw the inference that there was a joint criminal enterprise.

So with that background, the issue as to whether the fifth of those facts is established to the jury's satisfaction is simply a matter of evidence.

HIS HONOUR: Except that the overture to go 'all the way', which was your first --

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: --and seemingly necessary if not sufficient aspect of the joint criminal enterprise, included in it an invitation, on the Crown's case, to kill at the signal of Mr May.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: And therefore the agreement, the enterprise to kill, becomes on one view conditioned on receiving the appropriate signal.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, in my respectful submission that is too refined a way of approaching what the Crown says is the reality of what was going on. I mean, the intention to kill doesn't have to be set in concrete at any particular time.

HIS HONOUR: I accept all of that, but in this case as a matter of fact on your case it was. So on your case there was an agreement to kill.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: But there was an agreement to kill conditioned by a signal from May on your case. Now it may be, fore example, that that signal was not to have been given if, for example, the phones and the SIM cards and the money or the drugs or whatever it happened to be was given over.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: In other words, the killing may be an alternative to what was otherwise an outcome that was equally possible. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, I appreciate that.

HIS HONOUR: So that therefore the criminal enterprise is a criminal enterprise to, if you like, back up May in case things don't go as May hoped they would.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: In those circumstances it seems to me that if the jury are unable to find that the signal was given, they would need to be able to be satisfied to the requisite standard that a killing on a misunderstood signal or a killing otherwise was a possible outcome contemplated by Mr May.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. I see the force of what your Honour says. In that event, can I put it this way. The difficulty--

HIS HONOUR: I'm not firm on that view, Mr Crown.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: I'm suggesting to you an issue which, if you want to deal with it, by all means.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, I will. Your Honour, the reason for my reluctance to embrace the extended joint criminal enterprise area of liability is that a difficulty will arise as to what is what I might call the foundational crime. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: If the murder is a foreseeable incident of it.

HIS HONOUR: It's an unusual direction.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. It could be that it was a plan to make a demand with threats.

HIS HONOUR: That's possible.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. And rationally possible.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: So if it were couched in that way, that if the jury were not satisfied on all the evidence that there had been this joint criminal enterprise to kill, and of course they don't have to be satisfied that that pertained at all relevant times, it simply has to pertain at a time anterior to the murder.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: So in other words, if they were satisfied that a signal was given, a positive signal, that would suffice. If they weren't so satisfied, they would then consider what I'll call common purpose for shorthand purposes.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: On the basis that it is open to them to be satisfied that the men jointly embarked on a joint criminal enterprise to demand of Mr Heavens that he hand over property, with menaces, and in the circumstances in particular that Mr Burnes was armed with a loaded gun, that Mr May would have contemplated at least as a possible outcome that Mr Burnes would shoot the deceased with the intent at least to cause grievous bodily harm.

HIS HONOUR: I think, and I don't mean this in any way critically, because I realise this is an unusual direction, and an unusual discussion, but I think you're being hidebound with pigeon-holes. The difficulty is, it seems to me, that if the crime, the underlying crime, is making threats with menaces--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: --then that's a case that, frankly, I don't know that anyone has suggested. I mean, what was the threat? I mean, for all we know there was no threat, just a discussion which, if it went the wrong way, you'd get the right - I say 'right' in inverted commas - the 'right' signal, and someone would be shot.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: It seems to me that once there is a plan, the ultimate outcome of which or one of the ultimate outcomes of which is a planned murder--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: --you clearly have common purpose.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: And if as a result of the implementation of that plan, albeit misunderstood by one of the parties--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: --is a result which is contemplated as a possible result--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: --then you have a joint enterprise and, if you like, an extended criminal act.""

The directions

232Ultimately the written directions to the jury were in the following terms, so far as relevant:

""An act of the Accused - Joint Criminal Enterprise

3.The law says that if two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement that together they will commit a crime and then, while that understanding or arrangement is still on foot and has not been called off, they are both present at the scene of the crime and one or the other of them does, or they do between them, in accordance with their understanding or arrangement, all the things that are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of that crime regardless of what part each played in its commission. In such cases they are said to have been acting in concert in committing the crime or are in a joint criminal enterprise.

(i)The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused.

(ii)A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime.

(iii)A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed.

4.Where

(i)instead of the previous agreement being implemented, a crime was committed by one of the parties to the joint criminal enterprise; and

(ii)each played some part in committing that crime; and

(iii)the Crown establishes (beyond reasonable doubt) that the crime committed was a possible incident in the execution of the agreed crime and contemplated by the accused,

the accused is equally guilty of that committed crime. It does not matter that the crime committed does not correspond in every detail with that contemplated. There must, however, be a substantial risk that it will be committed and not just a slender chance.

5.To be an act of the accused under either paragraphs 3 and 4 above, the necessary elements are required to be proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.""

233The trial judge gave the following directions in his summing-up (at [48]-[52]):

""[48]if ... you would say ... there is an agreement that Mr Heavens be killed, that agreement would be an agreement to commit a crime, and which one of the two persons in that agreement pulled the trigger doesn't matter if both of them were present and the agreement were fulfilled.

[49]In paragraph 4 [of the written directions] I deal with an issue relating to a different agreement, or a different crime in this way: Where, instead of the previous agreement being implemented, a crime was committed by one of the parties to the joint criminal enterprise and each of the parties played some part in committing that crime and the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the crime committed was a possible incident in the execution of the agreed crime, and contemplated by the accused, the accused is equally guilty of that committed crime. It does not matter that the crime committed does not correspond in every detail with that contemplated. There must, however, be a substantial risk that will be committed and not just a slender chance.

[50]Again, in 5 [of the written directions], I make clear that the act of the accused under those two joint enterprise aspects, the necessary elements are required to be proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.

[51]Paragraph 4 deals with the situation, ladies and gentlemen, in which, for example, were you to come to a factual situation, or the factual finding, that there was an agreement by Mr May and Mr Burnes that Mr Heavens would be killed on a particular signal, but you were not satisfied that the signal was given, or the signal was understood correctly, you could still convict Mr May if you were satisfied, on that factual scenario, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the murder was a possible incident in the execution of what was otherwise agreed and the murder was contemplated by the accused, Mr May, that is, that its possible commission in those circumstances (the misunderstood signal) was a matter contemplated.

[52]On the other hand, if you came to the view that it was not a possible incident or it was not contemplated, then you could not convict in those circumstances. That's a particular factual scenario which you may or may not get to.""

234In relation to the second charge being an accessory after the fact the trial judge directed the jury only to consider it if it was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the prior agreement or if the accused had withdrawn from any prior agreements or had not contemplated a murder but was there and drove Mr Burnes away.

The appellant's submissions

235The appellant's submissions on this ground were essentially based on the proposition that extended joint criminal enterprise should not have been left to the jury as an alternative to joint criminal enterprise. This was, it was submitted, for three related reasons. The first was that no foundational agreement the subject of the extended joint criminal enterprise was identified. Second, there was no evidence of any such agreement ever having been formed and, third, that a contingent agreement to murder is insufficient to found an agreement the subject of joint criminal enterprise.

236The appellant relied on MacAuliffe v R [1995] HCA 37; (1995) 183 CLR 108; Johns v R [1980] HCA 3; (1980) 143 CLR 108 and Taufahema v R [2006] NSWCCA 152; (2006) 162 A Crim R 152 in contending that for extended joint criminal enterprise to be left to the jury, it was necessary to identify a foundational offence other than that which was committed (in this case the murder) and that the murder was seen by the accused as a possible result of the agreement to commit the foundational offence. 

237The appellant submitted that all that should have been left to the jury for its consideration was the question of whether the deceased was killed by Mr Burnes as a result of him being given the signal by the appellant which was the subject of their agreement. However, the appellant did not criticise the alternate charge of being an accessory after the fact being left to the jury.

238The appellant submitted that the plan to shoot the deceased was contingent on certain events occurring. In the absence of those events occurring, there was no agreement between the accused and Mr Burnes to murder the deceased. He submitted that if the jury accepted the scenario that Mr Burnes had either misunderstood the signal or that there had been no signal, then there was never a concluded plan to kill the deceased but rather a contingent agreement which was not itself a crime. The appellant thus submitted that in the absence of any other foundational offence the subject of a joint criminal enterprise he could not be guilty of murder.

239The appellant submitted in that context that the written directions were incorrect in that the reference in par 4(iii) to the ""agreed crime"" and the ""contemplated"" crime constituted a misdirection as it did not identify any alternative joint criminal enterprise other than to murder the deceased on the giving of a signal. He also contended that pars [49] and [51] of the oral directions constituted a misdirection because the different agreement or different crime in par [49] was not identified and the expression ""what was otherwise agreed"" in par [51] also did not identify a different foundational crime to that of murder.

The Crown's submissions

240The Crown submitted that murder was left to the jury on two bases. The first, it submitted, was that by a pre-arranged signal the appellant directed Mr Burnes to shoot and kill the deceased. The Crown agreed with the appellant that this was ""a straightforward joint criminal enterprise case"". The Crown submitted the alternative was that if the jury were not satisfied the appellant had given the signal or that Mr Burnes mistakenly thought he had, the possibility of this confusion arising was a possible incident of carrying out of the agreed crime. However, the Crown, as with the direction, did not suggest any crime other than murder to be the subject of the joint criminal enterprise.

241The Crown rejected the proposition that a contingent agreement could not provide the foundation for a joint criminal enterprise. It relied in that context on R v Mills [1963] 1 QB 522; (1962) 47 Cr App Rep 49 where the Court of Criminal Appeal in England and Wales held that an arrangement which would amount to an agreement constituting a conspiracy is not necessarily prevented from constituting conspiracy by reason of the fact that it contains some reservation, expressed or implied. The Crown submitted that in the present case the conduct of the appellant and Mr Burnes prior to the signal was conduct for which they could have been charged with conspiracy to murder.

242The Crown also submitted that there was a common purpose between Mr Burnes and the appellant at least (emphasis in submission) involving Mr Burnes, who was armed with a loaded gun, picking up and confronting the deceased about taking over his drug business. The Crown submitted there was a common criminal design and at least the possible use of a loaded gun to kill. In those circumstances, it was submitted, the appellant and Mr Burnes had the purpose of an act of criminal violence. The Crown in its written submissions, also put the following proposition:

""[82]The agreed crime, shoot upon the signal, had a number of possible incidents to it. They included 'back up' where Burnes saw fit, a man with a history of mental and drug issues acting out of panic or anger, a man such as Burnes misconstruing the signal. Burnes was not a professional assassin who could be relied upon to act with precision. These were incidents occurring without signal. It was a question for the jury whether the appellant foresaw as a possible incident to their common design to kill the deceased upon his signal, these events occurring. If so he was guilty of murder.""

243The Crown also pointed out that no objection was taken to the directions of the trial judge and that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. It was submitted leave should not be given to raise the issue.

244In oral address the Crown submitted that for extended common purpose it was not necessary for the prosecution to identify the joint criminal enterprise with complete specificity, relying on what was said by Gleeson CJ and Callinan J in R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; (2007) 228 CLR 232 at [31]. The Crown submitted that the alternatives were adequately identified in the present case.

The appellant's submissions on rule 4

245The appellant submitted that leave should be granted to rely on this ground because the misdirection for which it contends may have affected the verdict of the jury and there was thus a miscarriage of justice.

246He also submitted that the ground of appeal relating to the directions concerning joint criminal enterprise related purely to a question of law in respect of which an appeal is brought as of right (cf 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912). He submitted that r 4 should be read down to exclude its operation in those circumstances.

Consideration

247The difficulty which arose on this ground of appeal derives from what might be described as the different versions given by Mr Burnes of the instructions given to him by the appellant. The evidence of Mr Burnes in chief was that the appellant said to him that if he, the appellant, said ""I am going back to the car to get my wallet"" that was the signal to shoot, and that that signal was given (see [67]-[72] above). By contrast he apparently told JM on 13 February 2006 that the statement ""I've got to go to get my wallet"" was the signal not to shoot, but that the appellant did not say it (see [106] above). In January 2007 he gave a further version to the police, namely that he shot the deceased on his own initiative and that the statement of the appellant, ""I'm going back to the car to get my wallet"", was not a signal and that was the last thing he (the appellant) had to do with the matter (see [142]-[144] above).

248In these circumstances the question arose as to whether the appellant could be convicted if a jury was satisfied that the appellant and Mr Burnes had agreed that the deceased would be killed on a signal but not satisfied that the signal was given.

249In my opinion, the manner in which this case was conducted did not involve the question of extended joint criminal enterprise. This is because for liability to arise as a result of extended joint enterprise it is necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt an agreement between the accused and the person who physically committed the offence charged (the actual offence) to commit a different offence (the foundational offence) in circumstances where it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew of the possibility that the actual offence might be committed.

250In the present case the actual offence and the foundational offence were the same - the murder of the deceased. It was not in dispute between the parties (subject to ground 1 of the appeal) that if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Burnes shot the deceased on the agreed signal, then the appellant would be guilty of murder. The issue which arose was whether if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an agreement between the appellant and Mr Burnes to shoot the deceased on an agreed signal but not that the signal was given, the appellant could still be guilty of murder.

251In my opinion, the jury, if properly directed, could find the appellant guilty in these circumstances. The joint criminal enterprise was to murder the deceased in certain circumstances, namely on the giving of the signal. If the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware of the possibility that Mr Burnes could shoot the deceased absent the signal and that that in fact occurred, they could find him guilty. This, however, is not a case of extended joint criminal enterprise. What might have been called the foundational offence is the same as the actual offence, namely murder.

252None of the authorities dealing with joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise have considered the question which arises in this case. However, on analysis, in my opinion, they do support the conclusion which I have reached.

253In Johns v R supra the accused was convicted of the murder of Mr Morriss in circumstances where the evidence showed that it was agreed between him and a Mr Watson that he would drive Mr Watson to Kings Cross where Watson was to change cars and in company with another person rob Mr Morriss. Johns knew Watson was quick-tempered and capable of violence and that he always carried a gun. On the way to Kings Cross Watson told Johns that Morriss was always armed and ""wouldn't stand any mucking round if it came to a showdown"". Watson killed Morriss in the course of the attempted robbery. The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal upholding the conviction of Johns for murder was upheld by the High Court. In the course of his judgment Stephen J made the following remarks ((1980) 143 CLR 108 at 118-119):

""The criminal responsibility here under discussion is not that relating to the crime which is the prime object of a criminal venture. As to that crime, one who, while not actually physically present and participating in its commission, nevertheless knows what is contemplated, and both approves of it and in some way encourages it thereby becomes an accessory before the fact: Russell on Crime, 12th ed. (1964), vol. 1, p. 151. His knowledge, coupled with his actions, involves him in complicity in that crime. But if, in carrying out that contemplated crime, another crime is committed there arises the question of the complicity of those not directly engaged in its commission. The concept of common purpose provides the measure of complicity, the scope of that common purpose determining whether the accessory before the fact to the original crime is also to share in complicity in the other crime. If the scope of the purpose common both to the principal offender and to the accessory is found to include the other crime, the accessory will be fixed with criminal responsibility for it. In determining scope, it may either be restricted to what the accessory regarded as probable consequences of the criminal venture or may be extended to include what he regarded as possibly involved in the venture. To apply to such a situation a criterion of what is probable, as contrasted with what is merely possible, seems singularly inappropriate. The commission of that other crime will not have been the prime object of the criminal venture; it will in all probability have been committed as a reaction to whatever response is made by the victim, or by others who attempt to frustrate the venture, upon suddenly being confronted by the criminals. There will usually be a variety of possible responses to the criminal act. With each of these contingencies the criminals will have to reckon, if they are at all to plan their future action. What they conceive of as contingent reactions to each possible response will have, interposed between these reactions and the planned crime, at least one and perhaps a whole sequence of spontaneous and relatively unpredictable events. 

In those circumstances it is understandable that criminal liability should be made to depend upon the jury's assessment of whether or not the accessory before the fact must have been aware of the possibility that responses by the victim or by third parties would produce the reaction by the principal offender which led to the other crime. In such a speculative area, it would be remarkable were the accessory's liability for the other crime to depend upon the jury assessing, in terms of 'more probable than not', the degree of probability or improbability which the accessory attached to the happening of the particular reaction by the principal offender which in fact occurred, itself dependent upon the intervening uncertain responses of victim or third parties. Yet that is what would be required were an accessory's responsibility to depend upon such a criterion of probability, necessarily involving a balancing process and often a nice assessment of odds. I have spoken of intervening contingencies dependent upon human responses; however to these must be added those contingencies which may arise without any human intervention.""

See also Mason, Murphy and Wilson JJ at 125.

254Johns was a case of what is now commonly described as extended joint criminal enterprise. What is important for the present case is that at least in circumstances of a different foundational offence, liability for the actual offence arose where the accessory was aware of the possibility that the response of the victim would produce the reaction in the principal offender which led to the murder. If the principle in that case was applicable to the circumstances of the present case, then the appellant would be guilty of murder if he knew the circumstances in which the deceased was to be confronted could lead to his murder irrespective of whether or not a signal was given.

255In MacAuliffe v R supra, Brennan CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gummow JJ explained the doctrine of common purpose in the following terms (at 113-114):

""The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuit of a common criminal design. Such a venture may be described as a joint criminal enterprise. Those terms - common purpose, common design, concert, joint criminal enterprise - are used more or less interchangeably to invoke the doctrine which provides a means, often an additional means, of establishing the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime. The liability which attaches to the traditional classifications of accessory before the fact and principal in the second degree may be enough to establish the guilt of a secondary party: in the case of an accessory before the fact where that party counsels or procures the commission of the crime and in the case of a principal in the second degree where that party, being present at the scene, aids or abets its commission (Giorgianni v R (1985) 156 CLR 473). But the complicity of a secondary party may also be established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission (cf R v Lowery and King [No 2] [1972] VR 560 at 560, per Smith J).

Not only that, but each of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose. Initially the test of what fell within the scope of the common purpose was determined objectively so that liability was imposed for other crimes committed as a consequence of the commission of the crime which was the primary object of the criminal venture, whether or not those other crimes were contemplated by the parties to that venture. (Mansell and Herbert's Case (1556) 2 Dyer 128b [73 ER 279]; Ashton's Case (1698) 12 Mod 256 [88 ER 1304]; R v Radalyski (1899) 24 VLR 687; R v Kalinowski (1930) 31 SR (NSW) 377. See generally Smith, A Modern Treatise on the Law of Criminal Complicity (1991), pp 209-214.) However, in accordance with the emphasis which the law now places upon the actual state of mind of an accused person, the test has become a subjective one and the scope of the common purpose is to be determined by what was contemplated by the parties sharing that purpose (See R v Johns [1978] 1 NSWLR 282 at 287-290, per Street CJ).""

256Their Honours explained Johns in the following terms (at 117-118):

""In Johns this Court was concerned with the common purpose of a joint criminal enterprise. In particular, it was concerned with whether the scope of the common purpose extended to possible as well as probable incidents of the venture. The scope of the common purpose is no different from the scope of the understanding or arrangement which constitutes the joint enterprise; they are merely different ways of referring to the same thing. Whatever is comprehended by the understanding or arrangement, expressly or tacitly, is necessarily within the contemplation of the parties to the understanding or arrangement. That is why the majority in Johns in the passage which we have cited above spoke in terms of an act which was in the contemplation of both the secondary offender and the principal offender. There was no occasion for the Court to turn its attention to the situation where one party foresees, but does not agree to, a crime other than that which is planned, and continues to participate in the venture. However, the secondary offender in that situation is as much a party to the crime which is an incident of the agreed venture as he is when the incidental crime falls within the common purpose. Of course, in that situation the prosecution must prove that the individual concerned foresaw that the incidental crime might be committed and cannot rely upon the existence of the common purpose as establishing that state of mind. But there is no other relevant distinction. As Sir Robin Cooke observed, the criminal culpability lies in the participation in the joint criminal enterprise with the necessary foresight and that is so whether the foresight is that of an individual party or is shared by all parties. That is in accordance with the general principle of the criminal law that a person who intentionally assists in the commission of a crime or encourages its commission may be convicted as a party to it.""

257In the present case even though the common purpose was to murder the deceased on a signal, the fact that it occurred absent or as a result of a misunderstanding of the signal could be described as an incident of the agreement, and if the appellant foresaw the possibility of this occurring in those circumstances he would still be guilty of murder.

258In R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal emphasised the importance of drawing the distinction between joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise, described by Hunt CJ at CL as ""the so-called doctrine of common purpose"". During the course of his judgment, with which the other members of the Court agreed, Hunt CJ at CL made the following remarks (at 556):

""The summing up in the present case has suffered substantially from the judge's failure to ascertain what the Crown case was in relation to the first count until after the original directions had been given. I will refer presently to the problems which arose. Before doing so, it will be seen from the passages quoted that the judge has referred - apparently interchangeably - to a joint criminal enterprise and to the so-called doctrine of common purpose which extends the concept of a joint criminal enterprise. Where - as here - no such extended concept was relied upon, it was both unnecessary and confusing to refer to it.

The Crown needs to rely upon a straightforward joint criminal enterprise only where - as in the present case - it cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who physically committed the offence charged. It needs to rely upon the extended concept of joint criminal enterprise, based upon common purpose, only where the offence charged is not the same as the enterprise agreed. This Court has been making that point for years, (See, for example: Stokes (1990) 51 A Crim R 25 at 35-37; Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 at 400; 64 A Crim R 451 at 455) and it is a pity that in many trials no heed is taken of what has been said.""

259In identifying the defects in the summing-up of the trial judge, Hunt CJ at CL made the following remarks (at 558):

""(2)When the judge came to identify the law, he intermingled the concepts of joint criminal enterprise and common purpose. As I have said, common purpose becomes necessary only where there has been an agreement to carry out a particular crime (some text books call it the foundational crime) but some other crime has been committed which had been within the contemplation of the accused as a possible incidence in the execution of their agreed joint criminal enterprise (some text books call it the incidental crime) which is said to be within the scope of the common purpose. (Johns (1980) 143 CLR 108 at 130-131; Mills (1986) 61 ALJR 59 at 59; 68 ALR 455 at 455; McAuliffe (at 113-116; 233-236).

(3)No such extension to the straightforward joint criminal enterprise to strike (or to assault) the members of the small group was relied upon in the present case. The infliction of grievous bodily harm was clearly enough part of the joint criminal enterprise - either from the beginning or, at the latest, when the participants in that joint criminal enterprise started to kick the victims. There was no need, and it was confusing, to introduce the extended concept of common purpose and what may have been within the contemplation of the appellant (that is, foreseen by him) as a possible incident in such a joint criminal enterprise (The 'great guiding rule' laid down by Sir Leo Cussen, of the Supreme Court of Victoria, was that the only law which it is necessary for the jury to be told is that which it is necessary for them to know in order to guide them to a decision on the real issues in the case: quoted in Alford v Magee (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466. See also Small (1994) 33 NSWLR 575 at 600; Jones (1995) 38 NSWLR 652 at 655)."" 

260I shall deal with the trial judge's directions later in this judgment. However, the present case, in my view, is an example of a case where the introduction of the concept of extended joint criminal enterprise was unnecessary and likely to cause confusion in the minds of the jury.

261In R v Taufahema [2006] NSWCCA 152; (2006) 162 A Crim R 152, this Court emphasised the fact that the joint criminal enterprise depended upon mutual agreement, not knowledge of what others intended to do or a mere prediction about what is likely to occur (at [14]). Adams J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, reviewed the authorities and reached the following conclusion on extended joint criminal enterprise (at [20]):

""It follows, as it seems to me, that it is essential to firstly identify the foundational crime alleged to be the subject of the agreement between the alleged offenders, the incidental crime which occurred and the mode by which it is contended by the prosecution that the incidental crime is within the scope of the common purpose. Clearly enough, in this case, the contention of the Crown was that the offenders would jointly evade arrest, described by the learned trial judge as the 'crime of avoiding lawful arrest'.""

262In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction of murder on the basis that the foundational offence alleged, ""evade or avoid lawful apprehension"", did not exist (at [27]). On appeal the High Court overturned the verdict of acquittal and ordered a new trial as the evidence left open the possibility of another foundational offence being identified (R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; (2007) 228 CLR 232). Gleeson CJ and Callinan J dissented on the basis that the Crown should not be able to run what they regarded as essentially a new case. However, they made the following comments as to what was involved in the concept of extended common purpose:

""[31]Where a case of murder is based upon the form of culpability described as 'extended common purpose', the identification of the joint criminal enterprise, participation in which results in the accused's secondary liability, is an important particular of the case which the accused must meet. That is not to say that the prosecution must be able to identify the joint criminal enterprise with complete specificity. However, the judge and the jury must know enough about the enterprise to enable a decision to be made, first, as to whether it is criminal, and, secondly, as to whether the shooting was within the scope of the common purpose reflected in that joint criminal enterprise in that it was foreseen as a possible incident of the enterprise as explained in cases such as McAuliffe and Clayton.""

263The appellant places particular reliance on this decision. He contended that the foundational offence was not murder but an agreement to murder subject to a contingency which may or may not have occurred. This was said to be a crime unknown to law. However, once it is recognised the offence agreed to be committed was the actual offence albeit subject to contingencies, there was, in my opinion, a joint criminal enterprise. The fact that there was a possibility that the murder might not occur because the appellant for whatever reason chose not to give the signal, did not make the enterprise any less criminal. As was said in Handlen v R supra, two or more persons may be jointly criminally responsible for the commission of an offence which tacitly or otherwise they have agreed to commit and which is committed whilst the agreement is on foot (at [4]). That, in my opinion, can cover an agreement to commit a crime whether contingently or otherwise (see also Gillard v R [2003] HCA 64; (2003) 219 CLR 1 at [111]).

264The appellant also placed particular reliance on the decision of the High Court in R v LK [2010] HCA 17; (2010) 241 CLR 177. That case involved a charge of conspiracy to deal with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). The High Court affirmed the decision of this Court quashing the conviction on the basis that it had not been proved that the monies the subject of the alleged conspiracy were known by the conspirators to be proceeds of crime. The reasoning on which reliance was particularly placed by the appellant in this case appears in the following passage of the judgment of the plurality (at [122], emphasis in original):

""[122]The prosecution case at its highest was that the respondents intentionally entered an agreement to deal with money whether or not it was proceeds of crime. The matters upon which the appellant relies as providing the factual basis for the inference of intent, namely the respondents' awareness that the money may be proceeds of crime and their agreement to deal with it even if it was, expose the flaw in the analysis. At the time the agreement was made the money may, or may not, have been (or have become) proceeds of crime. The agreement, if carried out in accordance with LK's and RK's intention, may not have involved a dealing with money that is proceeds of crime. It follows that, on the evidence given at the trial, it was not open to find that either respondent intentionally entered an agreement to commit the offence that is said to have been the object of the conspiracy.""

265In my opinion this decision does not assist the appellant. Under the common law, the crime of conspiracy is committed simply by entering into the agreement. Under the Criminal Code, it is also necessary for at least one party to the agreement to commit an overt act pursuant to the agreement, however this act need not be a crime in itself. By contrast, joint criminal enterprise renders a person liable for the crime committed as a result of the agreement. 

266Further, the decision in R v LK turned upon the fact that the money intended to be dealt with under the agreement may or may not have been proceeds of crime and thus, as stated by the plurality, it was not open to find the accused intentionally entered into an agreement to commit the offence. By contrast, in this case there was no issue that if the contemplated act were committed, it would be a crime. 

267I turn now to the directions. I have set out earlier the written and oral directions and the circumstances in which they were given. Paragraph [51] of the oral directions, in my opinion, properly deals with the situation where the jury find that the murder occurred without being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the signal was given. The difficulty in the direction is, however, the reference to ""a different agreement or a different crime"" in par [49] of the oral directions and the reference in par [4](iii) to the crime being committed as ""a possible incident in the execution of the agreed crime"".

268Taken on its own par [4] of the written directions and par [51] of the oral directions would not, in my view, constitute a misdirection. However, par [49] of the oral directions, particularly taken in contradistinction to par [48], seems to contemplate an agreement other than that the deceased be murdered. In effect, it introduces the concept of extended joint criminal enterprise.

269The difficulty with the direction is that it invited the jury to consider the possibility of an agreement other than an agreement to kill the deceased and the murder of the deceased to be a possible incident of that crime. No such agreement was open on or sought to be proved during the course of the trial. It follows, in my view, that the jury was misdirected on this issue.

270There remains the question of whether leave should be granted under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to allow this point to be raised. The principles surrounding the operation of r 4 are well known and it is unnecessary to set them out in detail in the present case. I sought to summarise these principles in RR v R [2011] NSWCA 235 at [74]-[75].

271In the present case it seems to me that the appellant lost a real chance of acquittal. The direction at least raised the real possibility that the jury did not focus on the correct question, namely whether the appellant believed that there was a possibility that the crime would be committed irrespective of whether or not the signal was given but rather speculated on the possibility that the murder was an incident of some other agreed crime. In these circumstances, leave should be granted under r 4 to allow the point to be raised as the loss of the chance of acquittal involved a miscarriage of justice.

272It follows that on this ground alone the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.

Ground 4 - The trial judge erred in law in failing to leave the offence of manslaughter as an alternative verdict for the jury's consideration

273The question of whether manslaughter should be left for the jury's consideration in a trial where the accused is charged with murder will always depend on the facts as they unfold in any particular case. Having regard to the view which I have expressed that a retrial should be ordered on the basis of ground 2, it is not necessary to deal with this claim in any great detail. However, in deference to the parties' submissions it is appropriate to deal with the question.

The parties' submissions

274The appellant submitted that it was open to the jury to find that the gun was provided to Mr Burnes by the appellant and that there had been a direction given as to the circumstances in which he expected the appellant to shoot the deceased. The appellant further submitted it was open to the jury to find that those circumstances did not eventuate and the act of Mr Burnes shooting the deceased was not done in accordance with any pre-arranged plan.

275It was submitted in those circumstances that the provision of a loaded firearm by the accused to an unstable and unpredictable person like Mr Burnes was capable of being regarded as a dangerous and unlawful act carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. It was submitted this was particularly so given that on Mr Burnes' account he was left alone with the deceased whilst the accused went back to the car.

276In those circumstances, it was submitted, there was a clear basis upon which the jury could have returned a guilty verdict of manslaughter. The Crown submitted that the proposition put by the appellant assumed the appellant knew as he no doubt did, of Mr Burnes' mental and drug use history and that he was an unstable person. 

277The Crown submitted that on this factual scenario the appellant had given Mr Burnes a loaded gun and indicated that if things did not go well he wanted the deceased killed. It was submitted this presupposes that the appellant must have contemplated the possibility of the situation arising in which Mr Burnes would use the loaded gun not strictly in accordance with the arrangement but nonetheless with the intention to kill. It was submitted that the provision of the loaded gun cannot be divorced from the accompanying intention that it be used to kill rather than for some lesser purpose. In those circumstances it was submitted there was no room for a finding that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter.

278The Crown also pointed to the fact that the defence case involved a denial that the appellant had been involved in the crime at all and in those circumstances and absent any application by either counsel for manslaughter to be left to the jury, there was room for the application of r 4.

Consideration

279The circumstances in which the possibility of a verdict of manslaughter should be left to the jury in circumstances where the accused was charged with murder were set out by Hunt AJA in R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; (2005) 64 NSWLR 527 as follows (at [75]):

""75The following propositions follow from those cases: 

(1)Manslaughter cannot be left for the determination of the jury as an alternative verdict in a murder trial unless there is evidence to support such a verdict (or unless the case on manslaughter is 'viable').

(2)However, if in a murder trial the jury nevertheless returns a verdict of manslaughter where there is no evidence to support it, the judge may request them to reconsider the matter but, if they persist in that verdict, the judge must accept it.

(3)If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, the judge must leave that issue to the jury - notwithstanding that it has not been raised by any party, and even if a party objects (or all parties object) to the issue being left to the jury.

(4)(a)If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, and if the judge has not left that issue (for whatever reason), there has been an error of law.

(b)Subject to the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4 (see para [99]-[100] infra), the appellant is entitled to a new trial unless the Crown establishes that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

(c)In determining whether there has been such a substantial miscarriage, it is not permissible to reason that the jury's verdict of guilty of murder at the first trial excludes any consideration of the alternative verdict of manslaughter at the new trial.""

280The fact that the primary offender was guilty of murder does not exclude the possibility that the person who was the participant in the joint criminal enterprise was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. So much was made clear in the judgment of Gleeson CJ and Callinan J in R v Gillard supra. Their Honours, after referring to MacAuliffe supra set out the position as follows (at [25]):

""The general principle there referred to extends to the possibility that a person who intentionally assists in homicide may be guilty of manslaughter even though the principal offender is guilty of murder. The existence of that possibility assumes a difference in the intentions of the two parties. The secondary party may not know of, or foresee, the principal offender's murderous intention, but may foresee the possibility of the act causing death as an incident of the common design. The essence of the reasoning in the above passage is that, when the secondary party continues to participate in the venture without having agreed to, but foreseeing as a possibility, the act causing death, that party is regarded as intentionally assisting in the commission of a crime. In the present case, if a jury decided that the appellant foresaw as a possibility that Preston would fire the loaded gun at Knowles, and continued to participate with that foresight, then he would be intentionally assisting in the commission of culpable homicide. The level of his own culpability would depend upon whether he foresaw that Preston might act with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.""

281The difficulty in the present case is that there is no real basis on the evidence for the jury to find that whilst the appellant believed there was a possibility that Mr Burnes might fire the gun he did not foresee that Mr Burnes would do so with the intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. No case was presented on that basis and, in my opinion, there was no evidence on which the jury could make such a finding.

282It follows that this ground of appeal was not made out.

Ground 3 - His Honour's direction as to the evidence available to verify independently evidence of Ryan Burnes occasioned a miscarriage of justice

283The direction complained of was in the following terms:

""These are inferences that you may draw to support Mr Burnes' version only if no other reasonable inference is available. Those matters, and there are essentially eight of them, on which they rely, are:

The first is the relation between Mr Burnes and Mr May.

The second - and I will come back to deal with these - the second is the sensitivity of Mr May being 'bugged', that is, overheard.

The third is the details of the killing of Mr Heavens that the Crown says only the killer, or perhaps a witness to the killing, would know. They were the gun, the sequence of the shooting, the relative positioning of the shooter and the deceased, and the location.

The fourth is the possession by Mr Rafferty and [DN] of the mobile phones that were said to have been the property of Mr Heavens.

The fifth is the possession by Mr Burnes' family of the game boy Nintendo.

The sixth is the phone records.

The seventh is the false statement of Mr May, the Crown alleges, in his statement to the police.

And the eighth is the question of motive.""

284His Honour qualified what he said in relation to three of those items. In relation to the second one, sensitivity of the appellant to being bugged, he said that there were ""a number of answers to that ... the answers that Mr May himself gives in the recorded discussion ... That explanation is something that you can take into account.""

285In relation to the third item, his Honour said this:

""One of the issues about this, which you must be careful about, is that those details relate to Mr Burnes' involvement in the murder, not necessarily Mr May's involvement in the murder. So, while it supports, in the general sense, a version that gives Mr Burnes a role in the murder, of itself, it would point to Burnes' involvement and support the story that he gives but it does not relate directly, or isn't knowledge that comes directly, because of Mr May's involvement.""

286In relation to item five (possession of the Gameboy) his Honour said it supports generally the version of Mr Burnes but does not of itself support the involvement of the appellant.

287Once again it is strictly not necessary to deal with this issue because of the view which I have formed in relation to ground 2. However, having regard to the parties' submissions it is appropriate to deal with it briefly.

The parties' submissions

288The appellant submitted that of the eight matters referred to only three, namely items four, six and seven, could verify independently the account given by Mr Burnes. He submitted that the other five did not do so. Item one was submitted to be no more than background information which provided no support to Mr Burnes' contention that the appellant was involved in the crime. Item two, the sensitivity of the appellant to being bugged, could have related to any matter, particularly having regard to the Crown case that the appellant was engaged in the supply of drugs. It was submitted that item three, knowledge of the circumstances of the death of the deceased, provided a basis for concluding that Mr Burnes was involved but did not assist in proving the involvement of the appellant. A similar submission was made in relation to item five, the probable possession by Mr Burnes' family of the deceased's Gameboy. In relation to item eight it was submitted that the alleged motive remained inexplicable. The rhetorical question was asked, why the appellant would want to murder a man who was making him a substantial amount of money every week.

289The appellant submitted that by using the term ""independently verify"" his Honour effectively told the jury that these eight subjects had the potential to corroborate the evidence of Mr Burnes. It was submitted that for the evidence to have independently verified the evidence of Mr Burnes, it needed to be of such a nature that it confirmed in some material particular not only that the crime had been committed but also that the accused committed it. In that regard the appellant relied on what was said in Conway v R [2002] HCA 2; (2002) 209 CLR 203 at [61] as to the limitation of the use to be made of evidence of a co-conspirator as corroboration against the accused.

290The appellant acknowledged that the other three items had the potential to ""verify independently"" the account given by Mr Burnes but stated they were problematic and provided extremely limited support. In those circumstances the appellant submitted that the direction in question added unwarranted strength to the account provided by Mr Burnes and significantly diminished the warning that the trial judge had given regarding the potential unreliability of Mr Burnes.

291The Crown submitted that the learned trial judge did not use the word corroborate in the technical sense. It submitted, relying on R v Milton [2004] NSWCCA 195, that the evidence in question was evidence which the jury could use to find confirmation of the account of Mr Burnes either generally or in particular respects. The Crown pointed to the reservations raised by his Honour in relation to items two, three and five (see pars [284]-[286] above) and stated that the relationship between Mr Burnes and the appellant enabled the jury to understand Mr Burnes' conduct and willingness to ""go all the way"" and provided background information which made his evidence more likely to be true.

292So far as the question of motive is concerned, the Crown, referring to R v Ngo [2003] NSWCCA 82 at [181], submitted that motive was always relevant to prove the accused person did in fact commit the crime charged and answered the rhetorical question posed by the appellant - why the appellant would want to murder a man who was making him substantial amounts of money - by saying it was open to the jury to conclude the motive was that the appellant could earn more money without the intrusion of a middle man.

Consideration

293The remarks by the trial judge must be considered in the context of the warning he gave as to the reliability of the evidence of Mr Burnes both immediately after Mr Burnes concluded his evidence and in the course of his summing-up. In these circumstances it is difficult to see how the directions, which were not objected to, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

294Items three, five and seven referred to by the trial judge were matters which could be used by the jury as verification of a matter in issue, namely whether Mr Burnes killed the deceased. In those circumstances the direction was appropriate, consistently with what was said by this Court in R v Milton supra at [40]-[43]. The background information referred to in item one did provide a reason why Mr Burnes was prepared to ""go all the way"" for the appellant. So far as item eight is concerned it was open to the jury to regard the prospect of the appellant earning greater profits for his drug dealing business as a plausible motive.

295Items four, six and seven were items which the appellant acknowledged had the potential to be pieces of circumstantial evidence that could independently verify the account given by Mr Burnes. The appellant submitted that they were ""problematic"" but it must be remembered in that context that the trial judge warned the jury that they could only make use of the matters as independent verification if they were satisfied that no other reasonable inference was available.

296It follows that this ground of appeal was not made out.

Ground 1: The conviction of the appellant was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence

297I turn now to deal with the first ground of appeal. The appellant submitted that if this ground was successful, the result would be that the conviction would be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. The Crown did not submit to the contrary.

The appellant's submissions

298Unsurprisingly, the appellant in his submissions mounted a substantial attack on the evidence of Mr Burnes. In his written submissions he listed 26 reasons which he said demonstrated its unreliability. It is convenient to set them out in full:

""(i)He had a long history of psychiatric illness and drug abuse.

(ii)His account of the actual shooting of the deceased was inconsistent with the evidence of Dr Botterill, in that Burnes never gave an account where the deceased was 'somewhat crouched over', or 'crouched or twisted' [125] or 'standing upright with the left arm leaning forward and hunched a little' [126.35] yet the track of the bullet wound through the shoulder was consistent with the deceased being in such a position [120];

(iii)Before his arrest he told the witness JM that the killing had occurred at a different place than where the deceased's body was located;

(iv)He told JM that the accused had said that if he said he was going back to the car to get his wallet that all was OK;

(v)He boasted to JM that his style of killing people was a bullet in the head followed by two in the chest;

(vi)He boasted about having killed eight people and killing the first person when he was fourteen years old;

(vii)He had an ongoing belief that he had previously killed people in the absence of any evidence that he had;

(viii)He told the trial judge he was still hearing voices as he gave his evidence;

(ix)His account of seeing the accused in possession of a gun on New Years Eve was unsupported by any other evidence;

(x)His description of the type of ammunition he saw on New Years Eve was not consistent with the evidence of the bullets used to kill Mr Heavens;

(xi)He told police on 16 August 2006 that he used a 9ml [sic] or .45 weapon when he shot the deceased and could not nominate the colour;

(xii)He told JM he still had the gun and that his spouse liked firing it, yet told the jury he had left it in the accused's car;

(xiii)He knew that if he did not give evidence consistent with his earlier account he would be re-sentenced;

(xiv)His account to Dr Westmore was that he had a gun because he had previously been in a gang, yet in other statements and in evidence at the trial he said the accused had provided the gun on the night of the murder;

(xv)He said that on the night of the murder he received a telephone call from the accused at about 9PM on his mother's landline, yet there was no record of such a call;

(xvi)He said that whilst in the car with the accused there were no phone calls received. This was in conflict with the telephone records that detailed a call from the deceased to the accused at 9.45PM;

(xvii)In evidence he said that when the deceased got into the accused's car he had two phones, yet when interviewed by police on 16 August 2006 he said he did not see a phone but had read about it;

(xviii)After the shooting of Mr Heavens he said the accused offered him the phones, yet the Crown case was that the shooting occurred to obtain the phones and thus access the information on the SIM cards;

(xix)He told JM that he had taken both the deceased's Game Boy and his mobile phones;

(xx)He mentioned that he was in possession of white gloves for the first time whilst being cross examined;

(xxi)He gave a bizarre account of holding up his track pants with his white gloved hand also holding the gun, whilst smoking with the other hand in the moments before the shooting;

(xxii)He gave evidence that he saw the accused the next day (something strongly suggested by the telephone records), yet there was no discussion at all about the previous night's events;

(xxiii)His belief, communicated to JM, that the accused may have informed on him and may have planted a 'bug' in children's toys he had given him;

(xxiv)His previous use of the accused's name when he had been arrested when engaged in criminal activity;

(xxv)His retraction in his ERISP dated 18 January 2007 where he told police the accused had had nothing to do with the shooting, that there had been no pre-ordained signal, with the shooting of the deceased occurring solely because of his actions;

(xxvi)His two accounts along similar lines to Dr Westmore and on sentence before Justice Fullerton, where on both occasions he said the shooting had been as a consequence of events between him and the deceased, without the involvement of the accused.""

299The appellant reiterated his submissions on ground 3 as to the unreliability of the evidence of Mr Rafferty, the limited assistance of the evidence of the phone records which suggested that the appellant was not at his home on the night of the murder after 9.15pm, and the related alleged false statements by him that he was. So far as Mr Rafferty was concerned he referred to his evidence to the jury that he had lied before the Police Integrity Commission because he was scared that he would be charged over the death of the deceased. The appellant pointed out that Mr Rafferty's evidence was critical because of his statement to the Police Integrity Commission that he had received the deceased's mobile phones on the night of the murder.

300The appellant also submitted that there were a number of telephone calls which were inconsistent with the Crown case. These were as follows:

(i)One at 22.00.33 on 2 May 2003 from a number categorised by the Crown as ""Rafferty's new drug mobile"" yet made from a phone said by the Crown to be normally used by DN and SM. That call was transmitted from Paddington, a location near the home of DN. Detective McGregor gave evidence that DN had explained that Mr Rafferty had supplied him with a SIM card on 1 May 2003 and had registered it at this time. It was submitted that the making of a phone call at that time was inconsistent with the evidence of DN that he first saw the telephones after 1.00am on 3 May 2003, after he met Mr Rafferty near Central Station. It was submitted the phone records showed that contact between him and Mr Rafferty occurred much earlier, prior to 10.00pm on 2 May 2003. It was submitted that this raised a real doubt about the reliability of DN's evidence and a question about his possible involvement together with Mr Rafferty and the death of the deceased.

(ii)The second is that the phone calls from Mr Rafferty to ""[DN]/[SM]"" at 23.43.52 on 2 May 2003 from Ultimo and at 00.47.08 on 3 May 2003 from Elizabeth/Hunter Street, and from Mr Rafferty to DN/SM at 00.55.30 on 3 May transmitted from Sydney Kings 1 near Rosebery approximate to where Mr Rafferty then lived, was inconsistent with the Crown case. He submitted that the Crown relied on DN's evidence that he met Mr Rafferty after 1.00am on 3 May 2003 near Central Station and drove Mr Rafferty to his (DN's) home, and when they arrived in Paddington Mr Rafferty showed him the three phones. It is submitted that the sequence of phone calls, particularly the last one from Rosebery, was inconsistent with this evidence.

301The appellant also criticised the evidence of LM. He pointed out that she had told the police repeatedly that she did not know the identity of the deceased's drug dealer but simply knew him as ""Matey"". He submitted that her failure to nominate the accused initially and her concession that she was never told by the deceased from whom he received his heroin meant that her evidence that the appellant was ""Matey"" must be viewed with serious reservations.

The submissions of the Crown

302The Crown submitted that there was no doubt that the jury would have been satisfied that Mr Burnes committed the murder. Mr Burnes' statement ""Why would I admit to something I didn't do?"" was adopted. It was submitted by the Crown that once it was accepted Mr Burnes was the murderer, many of the matters said by the appellant to demonstrate his unreliability fell away.

303In relation to those which did not, the Crown emphasised that it was a matter for the jury to assess the credibility of Mr Burnes and, for that matter, the other persons who gave evidence at the trial.

304The Crown submitted the following matters supported the evidence of Mr Burnes that the appellant was involved in the murder:

""(a)Motive - the appellant wanted to take over the deceased's heroin drug business by obtaining his client base and having DN work for him and not the deceased. There were 'heated' discussions between the appellant and the deceased about this in the days leading up to the shooting;

(b)Prior to the shooting steps were already been taken [sic] to put this 'takeover' into operation. DN was instructed by Rafferty in the week prior to the shooting to give customers a new mobile number to ring;

(c)There was evidence that Burnes had great affection for, and allegiance to, the appellant. He had past drug and mental issues. This explained why he was a suitable candidate for the appellant to enlist and why he would shoot someone he had not met before;

(d)Burnes could only have known of the place and time to meet the deceased that night at Market Town from the appellant;

(e)The appellant had an arrangement to meet the deceased. They last spoke over the telephone at 9.45 pm. This was the last call the deceased ever made. At that time the appellant was very close to Market Town. Sometime after 10 pm the deceased was shot dead in Callan Park also nearby;

(f)The call charge records, when combined with other evidence, presented a convincing picture of the appellant having taken over the deceased's drug business within hours of the shooting. Immediately after the murder the deceased's three mobile phones are in the hands of Rafferty, who was not present when the murder occurred, and must have obtained them from someone closely connected with the murder. The appellant and Rafferty were in contact very shortly before and very shortly after the murder.

(g)The appellant lied to the police in a statement four days after the murder that he was at home at the time of the shooting demonstrating a consciousness of guilt;

(h)The telephone call by the appellant the day after the murder to LM when she was at the Rocks Police Station, from a public telephone near Burnes [sic] home, revealed a close association with him at that time.""

305So far as the evidence of Mr Rafferty is concerned the Crown submitted it received considerable support from other evidence, including the evidence of DN, the telephone records showing contact between the appellant and Mr Rafferty on the evening of the murder and that Mr Rafferty was the first person the appellant contacted subsequent to the murder. It also pointed to the evidence of LM, as to the phone calls she made on the following day to the deceased's phone and Mr Rafferty's evidence that he received that call.

306The Crown pointed out that there was no evidence of contact ever being made between Mr Burnes and Mr Rafferty any time prior to or subsequent to the murder and no evidence of any association between Mr Burnes and DN. It was submitted that this negatived the suggestion that DN, in conjunction with Mr Burnes, were responsible for the murder. It does not, of course, negative any suggestion that DN and Mr Rafferty may have been responsible.

307So far as the 8.57pm telephone conversation between DN and Mr Rafferty was concerned, the Crown pointed to the fact that DN's evidence was that he had received a phone call from Mr Rafferty who told him he was waiting for ""the guy"" to get the heroin but had been delayed. The Crown pointed out that DN thought that call had occurred about 11.00pm but the phone records revealed that it had in fact occurred earlier at 8.57pm. The Crown pointed out that at that time the appellant had not met up with the deceased and there was evidence there had been a later meeting time which would have had the flow on effect of Mr Rafferty being delayed in his meeting with the appellant.

308The Crown submitted that the evidence of LM was not inherently unreliable. It pointed to her specific evidence of the conversation she had with the deceased about friction between him and the appellant and that the appellant had been asking for the SIM cards. The Crown submitted that her explanation as to why she did not name ""Matey"" at the outset, namely that she was scared and traumatised, should be accepted.

Consideration

309The test to be applied in considering whether a verdict is unreasonable for the purpose of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is well known. It was laid down by the majority of the High Court in M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 in the following terms (at 493, footnotes omitted):

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 

And (at 494-495):

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 

310That test has been affirmed by the High Court as the appropriate test to apply in a number of cases: MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [25], [45]; SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [11]-[14].

311I have set out the test in detail in the present case because the assessment of the guilt of the appellant depended to a considerable extent on the assessment of the credibility of Mr Burnes and for that matter a number of other witnesses, particularly Mr Rafferty, DN and LM. The question in the present case for the Court is whether any doubt it may feel as to the evidence can be resolved by the advantages of the jury in seeing or hearing the witnesses: M v R supra at 493.

312In the present case the conviction of the appellant depended upon the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an affirmative answer should be given to the following three questions:

(a)Did Mr Burnes murder the deceased?

(b)Did the murder occur as a result of an agreement made between the appellant and Mr Burnes that Mr Burnes would kill the deceased on an agreed signal?

(c)Did the murder occur on the giving of the agreed signal or if the signal was not given, did the appellant foresee the possibility that the deceased would be murdered irrespective of whether the signal was given?

313In my opinion, it was open to the jury to answer the first question in the affirmative. First, Mr Burnes said that he did kill the deceased. It is true that he gave varying versions of what he said occurred at the time he shot the deceased but he consistently stated that he killed him. Further, the closest Mr Burnes came to saying the shooting was not deliberate was in his evidence before Justice Fullerton when he said he was ""paranoid and scared"" because the deceased had his hand in his pocket (see par [151] above).

314Further, Mr Burnes was aware of a number of matters which would have been known only to a person present at the murder. First, Mr Burnes' evidence was that he first saw the gun he used in the murder on New Year's Eve 2003 at the appellant's home (see pars [64]-[66] above). The evidence was that the shots could have been fired from such a gun. Second, Mr Burnes was aware the deceased was shot once in the left shoulder area and twice while lying on the ground (see par [72] above). Third, Mr Burnes was aware that when the deceased was shot he had a cigarette in his left hand (see par [71] above). Fourth, Mr Burnes was aware the cigarette was a Winfield Blue (see par [75] above). The evidence of Detective Morfoot was that none of these matters had been made public (see par [215] above).

315Further, the evidence established that shortly prior to the death of the deceased he was in the possession of a Nintendo Gameboy. Mr Burnes said he took the Gameboy after the shooting (see par [74] above). A Gameboy was pawned on 15 May 2003 by a person who produced the Centrelink and Medicare cards of Melissa Riley, Mr Burnes' partner. Although the handwriting on the pawnbroking documents could not be identified with certainty as that of Ms Riley, a handwriting expert stated that it was likely to be her signature.

316In these circumstances it could not be said that the conclusion that Mr Burnes killed the deceased was unreasonable. The criticism of his evidence by the appellant in this regard, in particular those criticisms set out in subpars (i)-(iii), (v)-(viii) and (xx)-(xxi) of par [298] above, do not in my view affect this conclusion.

317The next question was whether the shooting occurred as part of an enterprise between the appellant and Mr Burnes in which it was agreed that the deceased would be shot on the giving of a signal.

318Before going to the evidence of Mr Burnes, it is convenient to deal with a number of matters which point to the involvement of the appellant in the murder. First, the appellant in his statement acknowledged that he had arranged to meet the deceased on the evening of 2 May at the fruit markets near Leichhardt Market Town. Although the appellant denied that he met the deceased, Mr Burnes identified Leichhardt Market Town as the place where the deceased was picked up.

319The evidence of Mr Rafferty to the Police Integrity Commission was that on the night of 2 May the appellant gave him three phones and said ""You'll be starting tomorrow"" and that after that he met DN and they went to DN's home in the early morning of 3 May and made up the caps of heroin to sell. He also told the Police Integrity Commission that when he answered the phones on the following day, people thought he was the deceased.

320Mr Rafferty denied the truth of these statements in his evidence at the trial. However, a number of matters should be noted. First, the telephone records indicated that the appellant had been in contact with Mr Rafferty on a number of occasions on 2 May both before and after the murder took place (see par [27] above). Second, although it is true that DN was in contact with Mr Rafferty prior to the time of the murder, there were further conversations between them after it occurred (see par [20] above). Although the appellant submitted that the call at 0.55am on the morning of 3 May went through a tower close to Mr Rafferty's home at Rosebery, this ignores the fact that another call was made 12 minutes later from an unidentified location (see par [20] above). 

321DN's evidence was that he and Mr Rafferty met at his (DN's) house at Paddington where Mr Rafferty gave him the deceased's drug phones (see par [19] above). Although his credit was in issue, particularly having regard to his earlier statements to the police that he did not know Mr Rafferty, his evidence was supported by his partner, SM, who stated that DN and Mr Rafferty were discussing heroin dealing at her and DN's home between 2.00am and 3.00am on the morning of 3 May (see par [30] above). Significantly, she also gave evidence that on the evening of the day before (around 7.00pm) she and DN met the deceased and DN returned the mobile phones to him.

322From this evidence it would be open to the jury to conclude, particularly having regard to the advantage they had in seeing and hearing the witnesses, that the appellant came into possession of the deceased's drug phones and gave them to Mr Rafferty who had them in his possession at his meeting with DN at the latter person's home in the early morning of 3 May.

323It is then necessary to have regard to the evidence of LM. She gave evidence that the deceased bought heroin from the appellant, that he employed two runners for his business and that he used two mobile phones. She gave evidence that the deceased had told her that the appellant wanted the SIM cards and that he wanted DN to work for him (see pars [32]-[34] above). 

324LM was cross-examined as to various inconsistencies in her evidence and in what she told the police (see pars [41]-[49] above). The most important of these was her denial to the police in her earlier statements that she knew that the appellant was the deceased's drug supplier and that she knew the supplier only by the name of ""Matey"".

325In my opinion, it was open to the jury to accept that when LM said she did not know the identity of the deceased's drug supplier, she was, as she said, traumatised and out of her depth. There was no issue that LM knew the appellant. Having regard to the relationship between her and the deceased and the fact she knew the appellant, it is not inherently unlikely that she knew the appellant was his drug supplier. Further, her evidence that the deceased told her he was going to meet the appellant on the evening of 2 May is consistent with the appellant's statement that a meeting was proposed.

326If LM was accepted by the jury, they were entitled to conclude from that that the appellant had a motive for the murder and second, that he did want to procure the deceased's mobile phones, something which, on the evidence of Mr Rafferty, was achieved by him on the evening of 2 May.

327It is in that context that the evidence of Mr Burnes needs to be examined. It is correct that Mr Burnes gave a number of conflicting statements as to what occurred on the day of the murder. The first was his evidence in chief in which he said there was an agreement to kill on the signal ""I am going back to get my wallet out of the car"" and that is what occurred. The second was the version given to JM on 13 February 2006 when he said that the same signal was a signal not to shoot (see par [106] above). The third was the version he gave to the police in January 2007 when he said the last words that the appellant said were ""I'm going back to the car to get my wallet"" but that it was not a signal at all and the appellant was not involved in the murder (see par [144] above). The fourth was the version given to Dr Westmore when Mr Burnes said that the appellant and the deceased started arguing and the appellant gave the deceased ""a look, sort him out, talk to him"". The involvement of the appellant was not mentioned at all in the evidence before Justice Fullerton.

328In each of these versions, with the possible exception of the one given to Justice Fullerton, the appellant was said by Mr Burnes to be present at the time of the shooting or at least in the immediate vicinity. That is consistent with the appellant being in possession of the deceased's drug phones after the murder. Further, in at least three of the versions, the one in chief, the version to JM and the version to the police in January 2007, the appellant is said to have used words to the effect ""I'm going back to get my wallet"". Even the version given to Dr Westmore, ""sort him out, talk to him"" involved some sort of direction by the appellant.

329In these circumstances, in my opinion, it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had asked Mr Burnes if he would go all the way for him and that they had agreed that the deceased would be killed on the giving of a signal. If the evidence of the other witnesses to which I have referred above is accepted, the appellant had a motive for the murder and in effect took the benefit of it by obtaining the means to take over the deceased's drug supply business, namely the drug phones. Further, if those witnesses are to be believed, the appellant, shortly after the murder, took steps to obtain the benefit of that business.

330The jury would have been entitled to reach that conclusion on the evidence of Mr Burnes, notwithstanding his psychiatric and drug related problems and the other matters which the appellant asserted rendered his evidence unreliable. As I have said, a number of them only go to the issue of whether Mr Burnes killed the deceased. So far as the other matters are concerned, I have already dealt with the inconsistent versions of his evidence referred to in subpars (iv), (xxv) and (xxvi) of par [298] above. As to the balance, they do not seem to me such as to make the jury's conclusion unreasonable. 

331Since drafting this judgment, I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of Simpson J and of Harrison J. It is undeniable that the evidence of Mr Burnes was critical to the Crown case. It is also undeniable that the evidence of Mr Burnes ""upon the record itself, contains discrepancies"" (M v R supra at 494), and that the evidence and prior statements of Mr Burnes reveal a considerable number of inconsistencies, as did the cross-examination itself. However I remain of the opinion that, taking into account the whole of the evidence which I have outlined, it was not unreasonable for the jury to accept the evidence of Mr Burnes in chief, which, as Simpson J points out at [352], gave a concise and coherent account. As the trial judge pointed out in his remarks on sentence at par [21], the acceptance of Mr Burnes' evidence, notwithstanding the inconsistencies, depended to a very great extent on an assessment of his demeanour in the witness box.

332I have reached my conclusion independently of the view taken by the trial judge as to whether or not the verdict was unreasonable. It seems to me on the authorities that at most, only limited assistance can be derived from such material: SKA v R supra at [112]-[114]; SI v R [2007] NSWCCA 181 at [21]-[27]. Nonetheless, I am fortified in my conclusion by his Honour's remarks on sentence to the following effect (at [21]):

""The Court, as it warned the jury, must be careful before it accepts the evidence of Mr Burnes. Apart from the fact that he is a co-offender and was given, in his sentence, significant benefit for his assistance, he is an admitted drug use, has given prior inconsistent statements and has a history of delusional behaviour and thoughts. Nevertheless, when one takes account of the circumstantial evidence and Mr Burnes' demeanour, I accept the veracity and accuracy of Mr Burnes on relevant issues, being at least all of the matters recited above. Further, I am satisfied of that version of events beyond reasonable doubt.""

333In summary:

(a)The fact that Mr Burnes' account of seeing the accused in possession of a gun on New Year's Eve (see subpar (ix) of par [298] above) was unsupported by any other evidence does not lead to a conclusion that his evidence was unreliable. Further, the records from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital tendered in evidence show that the appellant was treated for injuries of the kind that Mr Burnes said that the appellant had suffered on New Year's Eve 2003.

(b)The fact that his description of the type of ammunition he saw on New Year's Eve was not consistent with the evidence of the bullets used to kill Mr Heavens was a factor that the jury would have had to take into account in reaching its assessment. However, Mr Burnes was not an expert in ballistics and it would be open to the jury to conclude that his description which was given some years after the event was mistaken. The description of the gun he saw on New Year's Eve was consistent with the gun used (see pars [10] and [64] above). The fact that he was unable to nominate the colour of the gun in August 2006 does not appear to me to be of particular significance in these circumstances.

(c)The matters referred to in subpar (xii) was an example of the delusional nature of some of Mr Burnes' comments. The jury was entitled to discount these matters whilst reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that his evidence was correct on the critical matters, namely that he agreed to kill the deceased on a signal from the appellant and that he in fact killed the deceased.

(d)It is correct, as the appellant submitted (see subpars (xiv), (xvii), (xviii) and (xix)), that he gave inconsistent evidence as to how he obtained the gun, what he took from the car and what he saw and what was said about the phones in the deceased's possession. However, this did not necessarily detract from the reliability of his evidence on the critical aspects particularly where other evidence established that the appellant took possession of the phones and that Mr Burnes took possession of the Gameboy.

(e)The matters referred to in subpars (xv) and (xvi) of par [298] were matters the jury were entitled to regard as not of particular significance.

(f)The fact that he and the appellant did not discuss the matter on the following day (see subpar (xxii) of par [298] above), whilst a matter relevant for the jury to consider, would not compel them to a contrary conclusion to their finding, particularly having regard to the other evidence that Mr Burnes shot the deceased and of the appellant's involvement.

(g)Mr Burnes' belief that the appellant may have informed on him and his previous use of the appellant's name when he was arrested in 2002 were factors the jury could take into account in assessing his overall credibility. However, apart from one suggestion that he was resentful of the appellant because he was able to ween himself off drugs, as well as the matter of his sentence discussed at (h) below, the evidence did not suggest that Mr Burnes had any motive for wrongly implicating the appellant in the crime. In those circumstances the jury was entitled to discount this matter.

(h)It is correct as pointed out by the appellant that Mr Burnes knew that if he did not give evidence consistent with his earlier account, he would be resentenced (see subpar (xiii) of par [298] above). The jury were directed to take this into account and it was open to them to accept the evidence of Mr Burnes, notwithstanding this matter.

334In those circumstances the matters said to go to the unreliability of Mr Burnes did not make it unreasonable, having regard to his evidence and the other material before them, for the jury to conclude that Mr Burnes and the appellant had reached the agreement alleged and that the appellant was present at Callan Park at the time the murder took place. This was a case where the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses was of very great significance, as the cogency (or otherwise) of Mr Burnes in the witness box would presumably have contributed greatly to the weight the jury gave to the version of events he gave there, and his account for his inconsistent earlier versions. It cannot be said that having regard to those advantages, the verdict was unreasonable or that it was not a conclusion which was open for the jury to reach, particularly where the jury were carefully directed on the problems with Mr Burnes' evidence.

335The third question is whether the murder occurred on the agreed signal or if it did not, was the jury entitled to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant foresaw the possibility that the deceased would be murdered irrespective of whether the signal was given?

336Once again this question turns largely on the credibility of Mr Burnes. As I indicated earlier, in three of his versions he referred to the appellant saying words to the effect that he was going back to the car to get his wallet. For the reasons given in relation to the second question, it was open to the jury to conclude that Mr Burnes' evidence was correct when he said that was the agreed signal and that signal was given. However, even if the jury had in fact concluded that the signal was not given or that Mr Burnes misunderstood it, it would still be open to them to find that the appellant was guilty of murder. This is because, having regard to Mr Burnes' psychiatric problems, the fact that there was an agreement to kill on a signal and the circumstances in which the appellant was confronted, it would be open to the jury to conclude that the appellant foresaw the possibility of the murder occurring irrespective of whether or not he gave the signal.

337In those circumstances, the jury was entitled to conclude that the third question should be answered in the affirmative.

338There is one other matter which should be mentioned. It was suggested in the submissions for the appellant that the jury should have had regard to the possibility that the deceased was killed as a result of an arrangement between DN and Mr Rafferty. The difficulty with this is that the evidence strongly supported the fact that Mr Burnes killed the deceased and there was nothing to suggest that he had any contact with either DN or Mr Rafferty.

339In these circumstances this ground of appeal is not made out.

Conclusion

340It follows, in my opinion, that the appeal against conviction should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

341In those circumstances it is not necessary to deal with the appeal against sentence.

342SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice. With respect to Ground 1 of the appeal (that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence) I have come to a different conclusion. In my opinion that ground ought to succeed. The consequence of success of a ground of appeal so framed is the quashing of the conviction, and entry of a verdict of acquittal. That conclusion renders it unnecessary to resolve the remaining grounds of appeal. However, since the Chief Justice takes a different view of Ground 1, it is appropriate that I record my concurrence with his Honour's conclusion with respect to Ground 2.

343The reasons for my conclusion concerning Ground 1 follow.

Ground 1: Unreasonable Verdict

344Since the Chief Justice has set out in considerable detail the evidence given in the trial, it is sufficient if I recount the salient facts of the murder of Mr Heavens briefly.

345Mr Heavens' body was found in the grounds of the Callan Park Hospital, Rozelle, in the early hours of 3 May 2003. It is apparent that he was killed late in the evening of 2 May. (The trial of the appellant took place in May 2008.)

346The only direct evidence implicating the appellant was that of Ryan Burnes. As is set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice, on 3 April 2007 Burnes entered a plea of guilty to a charge that he murdered Mr Heavens. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years, with a non-parole period of 13 ½ years. In so sentencing Burnes, the sentencing judge reduced, by 50%, the sentence she otherwise would have imposed. This reduction she divided equally, allowing 25% for the plea of guilty and assistance to authorities already given, and 25% representing assistance Burnes had promised to give in the future, specifically in the prosecution of the appellant.

347The case the Crown sought to make at trial was encapsulated in the account given by Burnes. Put shortly, Burnes said that he was recruited by the appellant into a plan to murder Mr Heavens; that he did so by accompanying the appellant to the grounds of Callan Park Hospital; that they picked up Mr Heavens on the way; that the appellant provided Burnes with a firearm for the purpose of the murder; and that the appellant told him that if he (the appellant) gave a specified signal, he (Burnes) was to shoot Mr Heavens. In the context of one item of evidence led at trial, the signal is of some importance: Burnes gave evidence that the appellant told him that the signal to shoot Mr Heavens was a specific form of words. The words were:

"" ... I am going to get me wallet out of the car"". 

On the account given by Burnes in his evidence in chief, the use of those words was a signal for him to shoot Mr Heavens.

348On the Crown case, when the three men arrived at Callan Park the appellant gave that signal and, in compliance with their agreement, Burnes shot Mr Heavens three times in the chest, once while he was upright and twice after he had collapsed from the effects of the first shot. Burnes rejoined the appellant at the car, and the appellant and Burnes drove off.

349Notwithstanding Burnes' plea of guilty to the murder of Mr Heavens, and subsequent incarceration, an issue was raised by the defence as to whether this was indeed the case. There was some, although relatively slight, evidence corroborative of Burnes' claim to have been the killer. Although there was, in the Crown case, some evidence corroborative of surrounding details contained in Burnes' evidence, there was none that corroborated his account of the circumstances in which he came to murder Mr Heavens, and none corroborating his assertion that he had murdered Mr Heavens at the instigation the appellant. The Crown case was therefore heavily dependent on Burnes' evidence. His credibility was thus central to the Crown case. I will return to this.

350It was central to the Crown case, and not in dispute, that both Mr Heavens and the appellant were heroin dealers, and that the appellant supplied drugs to Mr Heavens for the purpose of on-sale to customers. Mr Heavens' heroin selling business flourished, and he received larger quantities from the appellant, to the point that he himself employed ""runners"". One of the runners was a man who has come to be known as ""DN"", who used the alias ""Steve"". DN gave evidence that a dispute arose between the appellant and Mr Heavens, concerning control of the business. From the evidence of DN, it would appear that this dispute was resolved. Mr Heavens' then partner, known as ""LM"", gave evidence to similar effect concerning a dispute, although, on her evidence, the dispute was not resolved so amicably. With this background, I turn to the critical evidence of Mr Burnes.

351In evidence in chief Burnes gave, so far as can be gauged from a reading of the transcript, a concise and coherent account.

352Although I have given above a brief précis of the Crown case, I consider it would be helpful to refer, in a little more detail, to the evidence given by Burnes in chief.

353He said that he had known the appellant since he was about 13 years old, having met him when both were students at a school called ""Edgeware"". He had, in fact, lived for a time in the appellant's home. There was then a period when he had no contact with the appellant, but contact was resumed in about 2002. He said that he spent New Year's Eve 2002 in the company of the appellant, eventually at a Balmain hotel. There a fracas ensued, in which the appellant was involved, and was ""king hit"" by another person. He suffered an injury to his lip. He and the appellant, and others, then left the hotel and went to the appellant's home at Alexandria or Erskineville. The appellant was upset by what had occurred. When leaving the hotel the appellant reached for a railing, causing injury to his thumb. Later, Burnes went into the appellant's bedroom (where the appellant was with his de facto wife). There Burnes saw a gun clip from a magazine from a gun and a couple of bullets on the bed. The appellant had a gun, into which he was attempting to insert the bullets. The gun was a 1911 Colt. Because of the injury to his thumbs, the appellant was unable to insert the bullets, and Burnes did so (at the appellant's request) for him. Burnes said that they then hid the gun. He said that the appellant and his de facto wife left the house, saying that they were going to have the injury to the appellant's lip attended to. (This evidence was not directly relevant to the Crown case that the appellant was involved in the murder of Mr Heavens. It is evidence of a corroborative nature, as to detail, to which I referred earlier. Its significance will become apparent in due course.)

354Burnes then said that in late April or early May of 2003 the appellant visited Burnes at Burnes' de facto's mother's premises in Waterloo. He appeared to be ""pretty agitated"", ""visibly upset about something"". He did not explain his upset but:

""He just asked me if I would go all the way for him."" (T 382)

The appellant did not explain this request.

355Two days later the appellant telephoned Burnes, and arranged to meet him out the front of the Waterloo house where Burnes was staying. This was about 9.00 or 9.30 pm. Burnes did not regard this as unusual.

356The appellant did pick up Burnes, in a two door hatch back vehicle. Burnes sat in the back seat. The appellant told him they were going to pick up somebody to whom the appellant referred to as ""Matey"". Burnes had the impression that the appellant did not want him to know who ""Matey"" was. (Burnes later learned that ""Matey"" was Mr Heavens.) The appellant told Burnes to look under the seat. Burnes did so and:

""... I felt a gun in the shirt.""

The gun was under the passenger seat. Burnes took the gun from under the seat and placed it down the front of his pants. Burnes then gave this evidence:

""He [the appellant] said, 'If I say I am going to get me wallet out of the car', that was a signal to shoot."" (T385)

He said that the subject of shooting someone had been mentioned earlier, when he first entered the car with the appellant. 

357The appellant then drove to Marketown at Leichhardt and pulled over. Mr Heavens was waiting, and entered the car and sat in the front seat. Burnes did not know Mr Heavens.

358The appellant drove to Callan Park (a location Burnes knew) and drew up in a small car park. All three men alighted from the car. The appellant told Mr Heavens to put all their telephones in the car, and the three walked down to a grassed area. Burnes was about two or three metres behind the other two.

359The appellant and Mr Heavens were talking but Burnes did not hear any of the conversation. After a little while they stopped. Burnes thought that they had begun a disagreement. Mr Heavens took out a cigarette and offered one to Burnes. Mr Heavens was smoking his cigarette using his left hand. The cigarettes were Winfield Blue.

360Burnes then gave this evidence:

""They lowered, like the voices they calmed down a bit, kept talking for about another 30 seconds. Then [the appellant] turned around, looking at me, said 'I am going back to the car to get my wallet' and he walked off."" 

361Burnes took that to mean that he was to shoot Mr Heavens, and he did so. He said:

""Um, pulled the gun out the front of my pants, unlocked the safety, shot him once, he fell to the ground. I proceeded to walk away. I could hear him and so I went back.""

He said that Mr Heavens was ""gasping and gurgling"". Burnes therefore:

"" ... went back and stood over the top of him and shot him two more times.""

At this time, the gun was pointing straight down.

362Burnes ran back and joined the appellant in the car and they drove off. Initially, there was no conversation about what had happened, but, later, the appellant said:

"" ... just something like, he knew I would do it.""

He:

""called me a mad cunt or something like that.""

363At some point Burnes wiped down the gun and returned it to its place under the seat.

364The appellant drove Burnes home. He asked if Burnes wanted the phones that were in the glove box. (Burnes did not.) He saw there were two ""wads of money"", of which he took one, and also a Game Boy that was in the glove box. 

365That concluded Burnes' evidence in chief.

366He was cross-examined at considerable length, and to considerable effect. The attack on the Crown case consists largely in an analysis of the damage said to have been done to Burnes' credibility as a result of the cross-examination. In evaluating the evidence adduced, it is important to remember that Burnes was no more than a witness in the prosecution case (although a crucial one). The provisions of Part 3, Division 7 of the Evidence Act 1995 applied. Prima facie, although he could be cross-examined, within the limits prescribed by s 103, as to credibility, evidence with respect to his credibility could not be adduced (s 102). 

367It is apparent from the structure of the cross-examination that defence counsel had access to a very large volume of material relevant to Burnes' credit. This was put to Burnes systematically and logically. It makes, however, for a cross-examination that is not easy to follow, even on paper. I have no doubt that it was difficult for the jury to follow.

368Some propositions put to Burnes he accepted. Others he rejected. At times he appeared to accept (or reject) a proposition, and then take the opposite position. In respect of some propositions it is impossible to be sure what his response was intended to be. What is clear to me is that his evidence lacked, to a considerable degree, the reliability necessary to found a criminal conviction. In reaching this view, I have, to some extent, taken a somewhat liberal, or flexible, approach to the analysis of Burnes' evidence. I have, for example, assumed (where the transcript permits that reasonably to be done) that defence counsel had material in his possession to support the propositions contained in his questions. In what follows I have endeavoured to make clear where I have taken that course.

369Burnes has given accounts of his asserted involvement in the murder of Mr Heavens on a number of occasions. The first, it is to be noted, was on 16 August 2006 - more than three years after the murder. He was then interviewed by police, and the interview recorded. The interview was a lengthy one. He was interviewed again, over two days, on 30 and 31 August of that year. This resulted in lengthy statement. On 18 January 2007 he was again interviewed, this time with the protection of an undertaking that any disclosure made by him would not be used in evidence against him (see Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 s19), resulting in an ""induced"" record of the interview. Although Burnes was cross-examined from the records of these interviews none of the records was itself in evidence.

370In addition, on 16 March 2007, Burnes gave an account to Dr Westmore, a psychiatrist, presumably to be used in his sentence proceedings.

371The next account given by him of which there was evidence was given in committal proceedings of the appellant, on 3 September 2007. Finally, on 8 June 2007, he gave evidence in the Supreme Court in his own sentencing proceedings.

372Of some importance in the cross-examination, also, were transcripts of conversations with a witness whose identity has been suppressed and who can be known as JM, in and around February 2006. These were recorded pursuant to warrants issued under the Listening Devices Act 1984 (now repealed and replaced by the Surveillance Devices Act 2007).

373Also available to defence counsel were medical records, some dating back to 1995, when Burnes was 15 years of age, and others made by Justice Health employees, while Burnes was in custody in June 2006. (In what circumstances he was then in custody does not emerge.)

374Also available to defence counsel were notes of a conference held by the Crown Prosecutor and his instructing solicitor with Burnes on 28 March 2008. It appears that these may have been made available to the defence in a commendable recognition by prosecution lawyers of their duty of fairness.

375Cross-examination of Burnes began with the proposition that he gave evidence in chief in the terms he did in order to preserve the reduction in sentence he had obtained by reason of his promise to assist in the prosecution of the appellant.

376He denied that proposition. His denial received a substantial boost in re-examination, when he gave his reason for giving the evidence that he had. He is recorded as saying:

""I've been coming to gaol all my life. All right. I've done a lot of bad things in my life. This is the worse [sic], by far, and it wasn't even my shit. He knew I'd do anything for him, and I did it. Now I'm going to be in gaol until my forty [sic] my son will 18. My daughter will be 16 and that's it. For what? I don't know what. I was just did it [sic] and he knew I would do anything for him."" 

However, from the Crown point of view, that was probably the high point of Burnes' evidence. Defence counsel asked Burnes, at length, about his psychiatric history.

377He said that he had first met the appellant when they were both enrolled in the school (Edgeware) to which he had earlier referred. He said that this was:

"" ... a behavioural school for kids who muck up at school so like your last chance.""

378The cross-examination that followed established that Burnes was a witness whose psychiatric stability was severely compromised. He was born in June 1980. On his evidence, he was diagnosed at the age of 12 (in about 1992 as schizophrenic). He gave a history, to which I will come in more detail, of prolonged illicit drug use and multiple psychiatric hospital admissions. By the time he gave evidence (in May 2008) he had been in custody for almost two years (he was arrested on 16 August 2006). He had, until shortly before giving evidence, been treated with anti-psychotic medication.

379He agreed that, at least from the age 12, he had had psychotic episodes on a regular basis. He said, however, that he had not had a psychotic episode ""for a long time"", and that the last was about ""four to five years ago"", that is, four to five years before May 2008, when he gave evidence against the appellant. However, he agreed that, in the committal proceedings of the appellant, he had accepted a proposition that at that time (September 2007) he still heard voices in his head from time to time. He said:

""That's the downfall of being schizophrenic, you hear voices all the time, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm psychotic. 

380This was not the only time that Burnes drew a distinction between schizophrenia and psychotic episodes. Whether, medically speaking, this is a valid distinction does not appear on the evidence. He was asked whether, when he had psychotic episodes, he heard voices in his head, telling what he should do, or what he should have done; he replied ""sort of"".

381Moreover, he agreed that, in June 2006 (before he was aware that he was suspected of involvement in the murder of Mr Heavens) he described, to Justice Health employees, the voices in his head as ""a running commentary"". He denied, however, referring to the voices as ""a committee"". But at a different point in the cross-examination, he agreed that, in the committal proceedings, the following evidence had been given:

""Q:And the voices have told you things in a way where you have believed them or you have said to psychiatrists over the years that you believe there is a committee of people or beings that put messages into your head, you have told doctors that over the years, haven't you?

A:Yeah.

Q:And that this is also to do with something from outer space or whatever?

A:Yeah, I don't know about that, but, yeah the committee thing.

Q:Do you believe the committee put ideas on your head to tell you to do things, correct?

A:Yeah."" 

382Burnes agreed that, over his lifetime, he had been institutionalised in psychiatric institutions about six times, either in hospital, or in the prison system. As an adolescent he had come under the care of Dr Garside, a psychiatrist. It was put to him by counsel (apparently on the basis of psychiatric records) that he had told Dr Garside that he had killed a number of people, including by kicking them to death. He did not deny having said that, although he did not recall doing so; he said that he had not kicked anybody to death, but that if he had told Dr Garside that he had, then at the time he probably would have believed it; he would not have said it if he did not.

383For the purposes of the present exercise I am prepared to act on the basis that the psychiatric records are as encapsulated in the questions asked of Burnes in cross-examination, and that Dr Garside did indeed record assertions by Burnes to the above effect.

384Burnes was then asked about burn marks on his arms, which were self-inflicted. It was put to him, again clearly on the basis of medical records, that he had told Dr Garside that each scar represented a murder that he had committed in the past. He denied any recollection of giving such a history to Dr Garside. After further cross-examination, Burnes denied having made such statements to Dr Garside. Again, since the questioning was clearly based on medical records (and no objection was taken by the Crown Prosecutor, who, the transcript reveals, was assiduous in ensuring accuracy and fairness in the questions put to Burnes) I am prepared to act on the assumption that the records did contain material to the effect of the propositions contained in the questions put to Burnes. Burnes pointed out that he was 15 years old at the time he was treated by Dr Garside. At a later point in the cross-examination, when being asked about what he had told Dr Garside, he said:

""I was disturbed, a young kid. I wouldn't have been in hospital otherwise."" 

385Again, reference was made to evidence given by Burnes in the committal proceedings. This evidence was there given:

""QJust going back to the suggestion you were making to certain people over the years that you had killed a number of people, do you recall saying to any of those doctors or the person [JM] for example, or anyone else that at one point you felt that those burns you had inflicted on yourself were a memorial for each of the persons you had killed?

A:I probably said that, yeah."" 

386In the trial, he said of that evidence:

""Under the influence of some heavy drugs I might have [said that], yeah I don't remember half the conversations that were recorded with [JM]."" 

He expressly did not dispute that those conversations had taken place.

387Burnes agreed that he ""may have"" told Justice Health employees (in 2006) that he had a special relationship with God, that he heard God's voice telling him that he cared about Burnes, and that God was the only one who did. He agreed that he then said that:

"" ... everyone was out to get me all the time.""

388He agreed that, on the same date, he told another psychiatrist, Dr McClure, that he worried that he caused negative events, accidents and murders, and that they somehow related to him and were his fault. He was asked what other murders (apart from that of Mr Heavens) he thought he had caused. His reply is recorded as:

""It wasn't; it was just how bad, like from what I said after I shot Andrew I thought that I had like a massive dose of bad karma coming to me so anything I'd see that was going wrong around me, whether it be on television or my family or whatever, I thought it was because of the karma I was bringing around."" 

389He could not remember telling doctors such as Dr Garside that he had been killing people since he was in his early teens. He did agree that, at 16, he had told a social worker of a four-year history of ""voices and screaming inside his head"" and that he suffered ""paranoid delusions"" of being stalked and attacked because of his ""bad deeds"". He agreed that, when he was quite young, the voices in his head had told him to kill his younger brother, and that in response he had taken his brother into the laundry, poured turpentine on the floor and set it alight. He said that he did this because he did not want his brother to experience voices in his head, or suffer from schizophrenia.

390It was put to Burnes that he had told JM (in February 2006) that he was unconcerned about the murder of Mr Heavens because he had been killing people since he was 14 years of age. It is, and was, apparent that this question was taken directly from the listening device recording of Burnes' conversations with JM. He said:

""I might have said something about that. If you refer to the tapes and you listen to them you can clearly tell I was off my face."" 

391Burnes agreed that at one time he believed that his children were being eaten alive. A moment later, however, he denied that he had actually thought that this was so. This was in spite of evidence he had given in the committal proceedings that he had in fact held that belief.

392I have referred to the lengthy interview of Burnes that took place over two days in August 2006 (30 and 31). It seems, from a number of answers given by Burnes in the trial, that, initially in this interview, he did not implicate the appellant in the murder. He therefore did not mention, in the interview, the incident of which he had given evidence, following the fracas at the hotel on New Year's Eve when he had returned to the appellant's home and had seen the gun in the bedroom. Burnes said that, in that interview, he gave a number of untruthful answers (concerning, for example, where he had been living in May 2003) because he was being ""deceitful"". He said that in the initial stage of the interview he was attempting not to implicate the appellant. He said that ""there was some point"" in the interview when he decided to tell the truth. This was because he learned (possibly during the course of the interview) that Mr Heavens had children. He said that his protection of the appellant was also out of ""misplaced sense of loyalty"".

393In the induced record of interview of January 2007, however, Burnes told the detectives that the shooting of Mr Heavens was something he had done ""off [his] own bat"" and had nothing to do with the appellant. He said that the meeting with Mr Heavens was ""just to sit down and talk"" and that his earlier account concerning a signal to shoot Mr Heavens (which, it may be inferred, he had given in one of the earlier interviews) was ""all bullshit",2012-05-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

3SCHMIDT J: Terrance Burrows, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal his conviction on three charges. On 8 February 2011, he was convicted by a jury of counts 1, 3 and 4, having pleaded not guilty to the following charges:

""Count 1: On or about 31 October 2009 at Sylvania in the State of New South Wales, did assault [the complainant], a person then under the age of 16 years, that is, of the age of 7 years, and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency on her. (Section 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900)

Count 2: On or about 31 October 2009 at Sylvania in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], a child then under the age of 10 years, that is, of the age of 7 years. (Section 66A (1) Crimes Act 1900)

Count 3: On or about 31 October 2009 at Sylvania in the State of New South Wales, did assault [the complainant], a person then under the age of 16 years, that is, of the age of 7 years, and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency on her. (Section 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900)

4Two grounds of appeal were pressed:

""1. The verdict was unreasonable and unsupportable on the evidence.

2. The verdict involved a miscarriage of justice because it involved an inconsistent verdict with the acquittal on count 2 in the indictment.""


5On a conviction appeal the Court's power is that given by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912:

""6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases

(1) The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the applicant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.""


The circumstances in which the offences occurred

6On appeal it was not in issue that the complainant was aged 8 years at the time that she gave her evidence in February 2011 and 7 years on 31 October 2009, at the time of the events in issue. She was questioned by police on 1 November 2009 and then medically examined. The police interview was recorded and the DVD played to the jury at the trial, when the complainant gave her evidence. Her parents, Mr SH and Mrs BH gave evidence, as did the applicant and his partner. There was also police and character evidence led.

7DNA testing was conducted on the complainant's underpants and expert evidence was given about what was found by Ms Trabuio, a senior forensic biologist. The biologist Ms Wevervang also gave evidence about why no other DNA was found on testing of the complainant. Dr Hurwitz, who examined the complainant on 1 November 2009, was not available to give evidence, but the DVD of her examination of the complainant on 1 November was also shown to the jury. Dr Tzioumi, who examined the complainant on 6 November 2009, did give evidence.

8In written submissions for the applicant it was accepted that the jury was entitled to accept the complainant's evidence, together with the evidence of her parents and the DNA evidence, to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had kissed the complainant on the mouth, put his tongue into her mouth, his hand into her underpants and that he had touched her bottom. 

9The factual issue on appeal was confined to the question of whether the applicant also put his hand, specifically his finger or fingers, into any part of the complainant's anus, or whether he only indecently assaulted her by placing his hand under her underpants and grabbing her bottom in a way that did not involve penetration.

10There was no issue on appeal that the evidence was that on 31 October 2009 the applicant and his partner visited the complainant's family home, where they stayed that night. They and the complainant's family went to the beach that afternoon, where the complainant and her sister attended 'Nippers', (a lifesaving association event). They all returned to the family home at about 6pm and had dinner. The complainant and her sister went to sleep in their bedrooms at about 8pm. The adults spent the evening together. Alcohol was consumed and they all went to bed at about 1am.

11There were beads hanging in the doorway of each of the sisters' bedrooms, which made a distinctive noise when anyone went through the doorways. Mr SH's evidence was that he and his wife could identify and recognise the sound which the two sets of beads made, when touched. During the course of the evening Mrs BH heard the beads of the complainant's room at about 10.40pm. She spoke to the applicant who told her that he had knocked the beads as he was swaying and had lent into them.

12Later the applicant again left the room where the adults were and when his partner went to check on him, she saw him emerge from the complainant's room. He then told Mrs BH that he had heard the complainant yelling in her sleep and that he had gone in to pat her and had kissed her on the forehead. Mrs BH then checked on the complainant who was awake and told her that the applicant kept waking her up and asked her mother to stop him coming into her room. Mrs BH told her husband and asked him to keep an eye on the applicant.

13The following morning the complainant told her parents that the applicant had assaulted her, describing what he had done. She also demonstrated what he had done to her, on her mother. Mr SH confronted the applicant, who denied having done anything wrong. Mr SH asked the applicant and his partner to leave. Police were then contacted. 

14The complainant was interviewed and later medically examined by Dr Hurwitz at the child protection unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital. Two lacerations were found in the skin folds of her anus, the 'rugae', which could only be seen by parting the buttocks. Dr Hurwitz's findings were documented and recorded on DVD. The complainant was examined again by Dr Tzioumi on 6 November, after complaining to her parents that her bottom was still sore. Dr Tzioumi found that the lacerations had healed.

15The DNA evidence came from profiles taken from the back of the inside of the complainant's underpants. DNA from two people was located and a test for the presence of saliva was positive. The major DNA profile matched the applicant's profile and the minor profile that of the complainant. There was a strong possibility that the major DNA profile came from the saliva, but Ms Trabuio could not say for certain which of the two DNA profiles the saliva matched.

Ground 1: The verdict was unreasonable and unsupportable on the evidence

16In my view this ground of appeal was not established. 

The test

17In MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606, it was observed at [25]:

""[25] Where it is argued that the verdict of a jury is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, the test to be applied is that stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in their joint judgment in M v The Queen [(1994) 181 CLR 487]. That test was accepted and applied by this Court in Jones v The Queen [(1997) 191 CLR 439. See also Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106 at 123 [49] per McHugh and Hayne JJ.]. In M, it was pointed out [(1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493] that it was once common for expressions such as ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"", or ""unjust or unsafe"", or ""dangerous or unsafe"" to be used in place of the language of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, and corresponding statutes in other jurisdictions, and that such expressions might cover different parts of the statutory provision, referring, for example, either to a verdict that is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or to a miscarriage of justice because an accused has not had a fair trial according to law. Speaking of cases where what is in question is whether a verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, the joint judgment said [(1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493]: 

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 


18The task of the Court is that discussed by Whealy JA, with whom Buddin and Harrison JJ agreed, in FB v Regina; Regina v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217:
""115 The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal in an ""unreasonableness"" appeal has recently been restated by the High Court of Australia in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571. In the plurality judgment of French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ, it was stated at [11] - [14]:-


11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v R (1984) 181 CLR 487 at 493 by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.

12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v R (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [58], McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say (at 494): 

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.

....

14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" (Morris v R (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 473). In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated (at 492 - 493): 

In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"".

116 In the present matter, having regard to the ground of appeal relied on by the appellant, it is this court's task to make an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, paying special attention to those matters relied upon by the appellant in its submission, to determine whether the finding of guilt by the trial judge can be supported.

117 In making its own assessment, this court must, however, bear in mind the important qualification referred to in M at 493:-

But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.

118 In the present context, this means that, in making the independent assessment of the evidence, this court must recognise that the trial judge had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses, and that he was the tribunal entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence.

119 The qualification is further discussed in M at 494:-

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced.""


The parties' cases

19There was no suggestion on appeal that the complainant's evidence was not credible, to the contrary, the applicant relied upon it to establish his case. That case was that he ought to have been acquitted of both sexual intercourse charges, given that the complainant's evidence as to his actions was essentially the same in respect of both assaults; that she was a very articulate person, despite her age; and that she had emphatically denied that he had put his finger into her bottom. In the result, the evidence was only capable of establishing indecent assault, not sexual intercourse. 

20The difficulty with the applicant's case, so put, was that it took no account of the parties' cases and the other evidence which the jury had to consider. 

21At trial the Crown's case was that on 31 October the applicant entered the complainant's bedroom on two occasions. On the first, he inserted his tongue into her mouth and kissed her (count 1). He then put his hand on her bottom and inserted his finger or fingers partly into her anus (count 2) or in the alternative, he indecently assaulted her by placing his hand on her bottom. (count 3). On the second occasion he again placed his hand on her bottom and inserted his finger or fingers partly into her anus (count 4) or in the alternative, he indecently assaulted her by placing his hand on her bottom (count 5). 

22The defence case was that the applicant was entitled to be acquitted of all charges. The applicant denied all of the allegations. His evidence was that he had entered the bedroom only once, when his partner saw him coming out of the room; that he had not assaulted the complainant; nor had he told her father the following morning that he had patted her bottom. 

23As to the sexual intercourse charges, there was insufficient evidence to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that penetration of any part of the complainant's anus had occurred. The evidence left open the possibility that the lacerations she had suffered could have been caused by sand irritation, or hard poo, because of constipation. The applicant relied on the complainant's denial that he had put his finger into her bottom where poo comes out. That evidence, when considered with Dr Tzioumi's evidence, gave rise to a reasonable doubt that the lacerations had been caused by the applicant penetrating the complainant's anus with his finger. It was possible that the lacerations had been caused by the child's buttocks having been separated and quickly pulled apart. Accordingly, the sexual intercourse charges could not be found proven.

24This conclusion was supported by other considerations, which were submitted to include that the complainant never referred to a finger going into her bottom; her hand gestures when demonstrating what the applicant had done were not consistent with penetration; there was no evidence led from the Crown that she had been mistaken in her denial of penetration; that her complaint to her father was that the applicant had grabbed her bottom and on her re-enactment, she had squeezed her mother's bottom; that she never complained of specific pain in the anus; that she had not later communicated to prosecution lawyers that it was her anus which was sore, but indicated her buttocks; and that there was no positive result for the anal swab, even though saliva was a rich source of DNA. 

25Submissions were also advanced as to the possible explanations for the results of the DNA and saliva testing, including the applicant touching the complainant's underpants while she was getting changed at the beach, when the underpants were passed to her; stepping on them when they had been left on the floor; or DNA being transferred from the carpet where the applicant had walked bare footed; or from his sweat on a mattress; or when she had jumped on him during the course of the weekend. It was also suggested that she could have sucked her thumb and scratched her bottom. 

26It was also submitted that the jury would accept the applicant's evidence. He gave an immediate explanation for being in the complainant's room, without hesitation, when Mrs BH spoke to him. He had voluntarily given his evidence at trial, denying the allegations. He was a person of good character, whose evidence was supported by the character evidence given by his partner and his manager, Mr Redden. 

27The jury did not accept the defence case, so advanced. 

28The Crown's case at trial did not rest only on the evidence of the complainant. The Crown submitted to the jury that sexual intercourse was established not only by the complainant's evidence, but by other evidence, including the medical and DNA evidence. It was submitted that the only explanation for the applicant's DNA and saliva being found on the inside of the complainant's underpants, came from the complainant's account. The evidence suggested that at the time of the assaults the applicant had been intoxicated to the point of disinhibition. The applicant's evidence in cross-examination showed that his account was a fabrication and that he was trying to make up an innocent explanation for having been observed coming out of the complainant's bedroom. 

29It was submitted for the Crown that it had to be considered that the complainant's evidence was a child's account of what had happened to her. Other evidence confirmed that the applicant had been in her room. It was relevant that the complainant had told her mother that night that the applicant kept coming into her room and waking her up and made immediate complaint of the assaults the following morning. There was no suggestion that words had then been put into the complainant's mouth. She gave a consistent account of the assaults, including when interviewed not long afterwards by police. The injuries she had suffered, as well as the medical evidence, supported the complainant's account of what had occurred to her, as did the DNA and other testing and Ms Trabuio's evidence as to what that had revealed.

The evidence

30The applicant's case on appeal rested on the complainant's answer to the question of whether the applicant had inserted his finger 'where the poo came out'. That answer has to be considered in the context of her description, in her own words, of what the applicant had done to her on the two occasions that he entered her bedroom that night, waking her from sleep; together with the evidence of her injuries; the evidence as to the saliva and DNA found on examination of her underpants; the evidence as to how her injury could have occurred; and how the applicant's DNA came to the deposited on the inside of her underpants. 

31The jury had to consider the evidence that in October 2009, the complainant was a 7 year old girl, who on medical examination on the day after the assault was found to have two fresh shallow lacerations on the skin of the rugae of her anus, one 4mm in length and the other 5-6mm. The rugae are the skin folds near the external sphincter, which Dr Tzioumi described in her evidence as:

""It's just the skin folds around the anus. Most people are familiar with that, even you know when you change a baby's nappy probably is the time most people see it, where the anus is, where the hole is, where the pieces of poo comes out. Around it it's got little skin, the skin is sort of folded together the rugae is the Latin name for those skins folds around there.""


32The lacerations could not be seen without parting the complainant's buttocks. The doctor explained:
""Q. Could you see those lacerations without parting the child's buttocks?

A. No. When the child is lying there with her - in the normal neutral position, relaxed position with nobody touching her you can't because they're deep, deeper into the anal canal, so you have to part the buttocks of the child and stretch those skin folds, the rugae, to be able to see those two small lacerations.""


33The second examination was conducted by Dr Tzioumi at the request of the complainant's parents, given her complaints of continuing pain after the initial examination. In cross-examination Dr Tzioumi said that there had been no bruising found on the complainant's bottom

34Dr Tzioumi explained that the lacerations were fresh on 1 November, with no evidence of healing. On her examination, they had healed in accordance with the normal repair processes. Dr Tzioumi also explained that the lacerations were not consistent with chronic lacerations caused by constipation, which have a distinctive appearance different to the fresh lacerations found on 1 November. Nor were they consistent with a rubbing injury caused by friction. 

35The lacerations were considered to be superficial, not deep, as would have been the case if made with a sharp object. Dr Tzioumi's opinion was that there were two possible ways in which those lacerations could have been caused. They were the result of the forceful pulling apart of the skin, so that the rugae were stretched aside forcefully. Such an injury could be caused either by someone quickly pulling and forcing the buttocks apart, or by someone pushing something inwards between the folds. In her opinion, they could have been caused by a blunt object, such as a finger. 

36When she gave her evidence the doctor was read extracts from the complainant's evidence, including her answers to the question of whether the applicant had put his finger into her bottom, where the poo comes out. The doctor was asked to comment on this evidence. She said:

""The injuries are external to the internal sphincter as I mentioned earlier and the sensation of the poo come(sic) out is through the inner sphincter, the internal sphincter and these two lacerations are outside that, so that's correct in way where these lacerations are you will not get the sensation that the finger has gone where the poo comes out because that's further in.

Q. And what about her other explanation - I withdraw that. Her answer, ""He was moving it side to side but he was pressing it down really hard as he can because it really hurt"". If you'll accept from me that when she gave that evidence and said he was pressing down really hard she demonstrated with the palm of her hand. Is there anything you can tell the Court about that answer given the injuries that you've seen?
A. All I can comment from the answers that from what you read if you press very hard that will account for blunt forced trauma as I explained earlier in my answer, but the mechanism of this injury, if you push really hard and push apart the skin fold, the rugae, you can cause those injuries. Now the child, how the child experience without seeing the part of the hand and exactly which part of the hand was pushing against into her bottom as it was the earlier part the answer into the bottom, it - for me looking at the injuries that description fits.

Q. What does it fit?
A. That pressure from the outside into the bottom to the point of hurting could explain the injuries.""


37In cross-examination, Dr Tzioumi was again taken to the complainant's description of what the applicant had done, including her demonstration of the applicant's hand movements. Her evidence was:

""Does the record of hand movements that I've just indicated to you [the complainant] - well asked you to assume [the complainant] made during the interview with police, the absence of any reference at anytime contrary to what you've been told, of any finger being put in the bottom and the denial of the finger going into the bottom and the account that it was ""only at the outside"". Do any of those things affect any of the evidence that you've given about the cause of the injury""
A. The cause of the injuries indicated originally in my original answer is that a blunt force trauma and as stretching or forceful pushing, that's what can cause those injuries.

Q. And by blunt force trauma, what we mean is something not sharp?
A. That is correct.""


38Dr Tzioumi later answered 'yes' when asked 'Is it your opinion that the injuries you saw are consistent with the insertion of a finger or fingers into the child's anus?'. 

39The jury saw the DVD of the complainant's account to the police of the assaults and also saw her give her evidence. Her account to police began with:
""And, and when he came in, he, he put his tongue into my mouth and I didn't' like it, and he put his hand in my, to my bottom and I didn't like it either.""


40She said that the applicant woke her up when 'he put his hand in my bottom' (A 154). She demonstrated how she put her teeth together, to stop him putting his tongue in her mouth; how he tried to open her mouth with his tongue; and how she put the sheet over her mouth to stop him; She then said that 'then he was trying to turn me around' (A164). She said:
""Q175 O.K. All right. And after he was trying to turn you over, what's the very next thing that he did?
A. He put his hand into my bottom.""


41She said he put his hand inside her undies and:

Q187 O.K. All right. All right. And can you tell me, because I wasn't there and it's really important that I find out, what was his hand doing when it was touching your bottom?

A He was, he was squashing it and moving it around.

Q188 O.K. All right. Now how did that feel to you?

A It really hurt. 

Q189 It really hurt?

A And I was trying, I said, Don't, to him two times or three, he ---



42Later she said again that he was using his hands and she felt 'his hand going into my bottom' (A 198) and:

Q198 O.K. You tell me what you felt.

A His hand going into my bottom.

Q199 O.K. All right. And tell me how that felt?

A Really, it, he, he was, he was moving it to side to side but he, he was pressing it down really hard as he can ---

Q200 Mmm.

A --- 'cause it really hurt.

Q201 O.K. And you, you definitely think that went inside your bottom?

A (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)

Q202 And what does that mean when you go like that?

A Yes.

Q203 O.K. Good girl, thanks for that. O.K. How long do you think he had his hand inside your bottom for?

A I don't know because he took it out, then put it back in, took it out, put it back in, took it out, put it back in, took it out and put it back in heaps of times.



43After the applicant left her room the complainant went back to sleep. She woke again later and he 'did the same thing' (A 235). Then she said:

Q236 O.K. All right. Now what did, what's the very first thing he did when he came back into your room?

A He put his hand in to my bottom.

Q237 O.K. All right. Now this second time when he put his hand into your bottom, what did he do with his hand?

A He moved it around, then squashed it, and then came back out, in, out, in, out, in, out.

Q238 O.K. All right. This second time that he came into your room did he put his hand into your underwear or on the outside?

A Into my underwear.

Q239 O.K. And did he put his hand into your bottom?

A Yes.

Q240 And what makes you think that it went inside your bottom?

A Because I heard my undies smack me like really hard.

Q241 O.K. And is there anything else that makes you think that he put his hand into your bottom?

A. No.

Q242 O.K. This second time that we're talking about, did it, how did it feel?

A It felt he was moving around and he was.

Q243 Yeah, O.K.

A. Then he squashed it.

Q244 You know how you told me that the first time it hurt, did it hurt the second time?

A Yes.""


44The complainant was also asked:

Q245 O.K. All right. O.K. Now do you think he put his, you know, O.K. You know how you go to the toilet?

A Yes.

Q246 O.K. And you know how you do a poo?

A Yes.

Q247 O.K. Do you think he put his finger into your bottom where the poo comes out?

A No.

Q248 O.K. All right. You know the first time where we, when we were talking, O.K., do you think he put his finger into your bottom where the poo comes out?

A No.

Q249 O.K. All right, good girl. I just need to check that, O.K.

A It went to the back, not the front.

Q.250 It went to the back as well, O.K. All right. At any time did he put his finger into your bottom?

A No.

Q251 No.

A Only at the outside.

Q252 The outside, O.K. Good girl. All right. Now this second time when he, he's done it again and he's putting it in and out and in and out, what's the next thing that happened?

A He was keep doing it.

Q253 O.K. All right. And when he, how long do you think he was doing it for the second time?

A I don't know. 


45The complainant also said that she noticed that the first time that his hands were wet. She said that:

'Q268 O.K. His hands were wet. And how do you know they were wet?

A Because he went to the toilet.

Q269 O.K. An could you feel they were wet?

A Yes.

Q.270 Yeah, And where did you feel that they were wet?

A Inside, on my pants, wiping it onto my pants.""


46The complainant drew a picture, identifying that the applicant had touched her on the bottom and not the vagina. When the complainant gave evidence at the trial, she identified on another drawing, where she said it really hurt when the applicant touched her. She circled her bottom, not just her anus.

47The complainant was shortly cross-examined. She said that she had not scratched her bottom during the night; that she did not call out in her sleep; that she did not have nightmares about someone squeezing her bottom; and that no-one else had ever scratched her bottom. She said that when the applicant came into her bedroom, he had put his hand on her bottom and put his tongue into her mouth. 

48In her evidence Ms Trabuio explained what DNA testing of several areas of the complainant's underpants had revealed, having been provided with samples of the DNA of both the complainant and the applicant. She explained that it is expected that skin cells will be deposited on a garment by its wearer. The DNA testing had found DNA of only two people on the underpants, a male and a female, with a major and a minor contributor. The major profile matched the applicant and the minor profile the complainant. The female DNA found was most likely to have originated from skin cells transferred from the complainant during normal wearing of the underpants. 

49Ms Trabuio also explained that an amylase test had found the presence of saliva. Amylase is an enzyme found in saliva. This test did not identify whose saliva was on the underpants, but Ms Trabuio explained that saliva is a very rich source of DNA. Her opinion was that given that the major contributor of the DNA found on the underpants was not the complainant's DNA, there was a strong probability that the DNA from the major male contributor came from a DNA rich source such as the saliva found on the underpants. There was no other DNA source such as semen or blood found there, nor were faeces found. 

50Ms Trabuio was cross-examined about the nature of DNA testing. She agreed that different people shed cells at differing rates. She was examined as to the possibility of transfer of the applicant's cells to the underpants from the carpet, or a mattress, or a wet source of DNA such as spittle transferred from a forehead to clothing or buttocks, all of which she accepted were possible. In re-examination, however, she explained that for DNA transfer to result from friction, so that a major DNA profile was left on the underpants, would require substantial rubbing. A light touch would not leave detectable DNA, or only very little.

51The jury also had to consider the applicant's evidence, which was that he had entered the complainant's room only once while she was asleep, when he heard her yell out. He described what he had done, patting her and kissing her on the forehead, which was entirely inconsistent with the complainant's account. His account was tested in cross-examination, when he denied the complainant's version of what had occurred. He also denied telling her father the next day that 'I only kissed her on the cheek and patted her bottom', as was Mr SH's evidence of their discussion, after he confronted the applicant about the complainant's disclosure to her parents. The applicant denied assaulting the complainant; he denied causing the lacerations she had suffered; he could give no explanation as to how his saliva or DNA could have been found in her underpants. He said it was just a coincidence that his DNA was found there. He also denied having licked his finger, before putting it into her underpants, in order to lubricate the insertion of his finger into her anus. 

The Jury was entitled to conclude that penetration had occurred

52On appeal the applicant accepted that the jury was entitled to prefer the complainant's evidence over his account. The only issue was whether the jury was entitled to conclude on the evidence, that there had been any penetration of the applicant's anus, given her answer to the question of whether the applicant had put his finger into her bottom where the poo came out. That evidence had to be considered in light of the other evidence which the complainant gave, as well as the fact of the lacerations, the evidence Dr Tzioumi gave as to how they could have been caused and the DNA evidence. 

53It was not the applicant's case that given their location, the lacerations which the complainant suffered were not located in her anus, nor that partial penetration of her anus was not sufficient to establish the sexual intercourse charge. His case was rather that the lacerations might have been caused by the other possible way in which Dr Tzioumi explained the skin folds surrounding the complainant's anus could have been moved apart, so that the rugae were stretched aside so forcefully, that the skin of the anus was lacerated. That being so, the applicant was entitled to the benefit of a reasonable doubt and acquittal of both sexual intercourse charges.

54It seems to me that on all of the evidence, the jury was entitled to come to the conclusion that there had been partial penetration, as was Dr Tzioumi's opinion. On medical examination the complainant's buttocks had to be moved apart, in order for the lacerations in her anal canal to be observed. No bruising was found on the buttocks. The major contributor of the DNA found on the inside of the underpants was that of the applicant. A likely source of that amount of DNA was his saliva. 

55On the complainant's evidence, it is apparent that she could not see what the applicant was doing to her bottom on either occasion when he entered her bedroom and woke her from sleep. She described what she could feel him doing when he put his hands down her underpants. She described squashing, pushing down hard and putting his hand 'in and out' of her bottom. She described feeling pain. Her evidence was not, as was submitted for the applicant, that the applicant was only putting his hand in and out of her underpants.

56That the complainant did not distinguish that it was her anus, which hurt, rather than her buttocks, when asked to indicate on a drawing where she was hurt, does not establish that there was no penetration. Given the complainant's description of all of the applicant's acts, the lacerations in the rugae and the absence of bruising on the buttocks, that she did not isolate feeling pain in her anus, other than generally in her bottom, sheds no light on what penetration occurred. 

57There was no evidence that the lacerations were caused by the applicant forcefully pulling her buttocks apart, the other way in which Dr Tzioumi explained that such lacerations could have been caused. As Dr Tzioumi explained it, that would have involved a pulling action. That this was what had occurred was not suggested to the complainant in cross-examination. Nor did the applicant give such an account. Nor does it seem consistent with the complainant's descriptions of the applicant's acts, nor her action, at one point, of demonstrating with an open hand what the applicant had done.

58The complainant was a 7 year old child. I consider that due allowance had to be made for her age and the difficulty of her being able to describe precisely what she felt the applicant doing with his hand in her underpants during the two incidents. Her evidence of experiencing pain is consistent with the infliction of the lacerations in the skin folds of her anus. Her description of the various things which the applicant did to her, which included a side to side movement and various pushing actions, including, as she put it, the applicant pushing his hand repeatedly 'in and out' of her bottom, included no account of him moving her buttocks forcefully apart. 

59Her answer, when asked if he had pushed his finger into her bottom where the poo came out, was no. As Dr Tzioumi explained, however, her other descriptions were consistent with applicant using his hand with a pushing motion 'into her bottom', that is pushing between her buttocks, forcing the skin folds of the rugae so far apart that they lacerated near the exterior sphincter, but not pushing his finger into the anal canal as far as the interior sphincter, where poo coming out is felt, that being located higher up the anus. Dr Tzioumi's explanation was not challenged. It was not suggested to her in cross-examination that it was implausible, or an overly technical explanation of how faeces are passed, inconsistent with a child's understanding of the question she was asked, as was submitted on appeal. 

60In my view, given the DNA and saliva found on the inside of the complainant's underpants; the two lacerations in the anal canal, consistent with the complainant's description of the applicant moving his hand 'in and out' of her bottom; her description of having been caused pain; having in mind the evidence as to how such an injury could be caused by a pushing action; and the absence of any evidence that the complainant's buttocks were forcefully pulled apart with a pulling action, that being the other way in which such an injury could be caused, the evidence left no reasonable doubt that at some point during the two incidents, there had been partial penetration of the complainant's anus.

61In the result it may not be concluded that the jury's verdict was unreasonable or unsupported on the evidence. Having made an independent assessment of the evidence, in my view there is no doubt as to the guilt of the accused in relation to the sexual assault charge of which he was convicted. In my opinion it was well open to the jury, as a matter of fact, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant on that charge. I do not consider that there is any danger that an innocent person has been convicted of that charge.

Ground 2: The verdict involved a miscarriage of justice because it involved an inconsistent verdict with the acquittal on count 2 in the indictment

62The applicant was charged with two counts of sexual intercourse. He was acquitted of the first charge and convicted of the second. The applicant's case was that in the result the verdicts were inconsistent, given the complainant's description of both assaults in similar terms. There were no distinguishing features in the evidence as to the two assaults. In the absence of other evidence which could rationally explain the differing verdicts in relation to each assault, the inescapable conclusion from the first acquittal was that there had been some compromise reasoning by the jury. There was no other way to reconcile the two verdicts. 

63In my view this ground of appeal was also not established. 

The test

64Reliance was placed on the observations in MacKenzie v R [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348:

""5. Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and commonsense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury's duty [R v Irvine [1976] 1 NZLR 96 at 99; R v Morgan [1981] 2 NZLR 164 at 168-169; R v Cooper (1993) 149 AR 207; Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings and Practice in Canada, (1983) at s15.212, requiring that the verdicts be ""so mutually contradictory or violently at odds in relation to the evidence that they cannot stand together in the sense that no reasonable jury, who had applied their mind to the facts of the case, could have arrived at the same conclusion"": R v Peterson (1996) 106 CCC (3d) 64 at 79; cf Hall v Poyser (1845) 13 M and W 600 [153 ER 251]; Bedford v Crapper [1949] 3 DLR 153.]. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law [R v Zundel (1987) 35 DLR (4d) 338 at 401-402 applying R v McShannock (1980) 55 CCC (2d) 53 at 55-56; cf Mack v Elvy (1916) 16 SR (NSW) 313]. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside [R v Drury (1971) 56 Cr App R 104 at 105]. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ""It all depends upon the facts of the case"".""


65In that case the Court was not satisfied that the verdicts returned by the jury were so inconsistent as to render the resulting convictions of the applicant unsafe or unsatisfactory, even though at first sight, the differentiation between the verdicts appeared a little difficult to understand, given an element of factual inconsistency. That conclusion rested on a consideration of the other general propositions which had been outlined, in addition to the fifth proposition quoted above, in the context of the particular facts of that case. 

66The other propositions were that firstly, there is a distinction which must be drawn between cases of legal or technical inconsistency and cases of suggested factual inconsistency, which are more difficult to resolve; (factual inconsistency being the complaint advanced in this case). The second proposition related to persons tried separately in relation to connected events, which does not arise here. The third was:

""3. Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and reasonableness. A judgment of Devlin J in R v Stone [Unreported, 13 December 1954 per Devlin J] is often cited as expressing the test [See eg R v Hunt [1968] 2 QB 433 at 438; R v Durante [1972] 1 WLR 1612 at 1617; [1972] 3 All ER 962 at 966; cf Archbold, Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 43rd ed (1995) vol 1 at para 4-para 457]:

""He must satisfy the court that the two verdicts cannot stand together, meaning thereby that no reasonable jury who had applied their mind properly to the facts in the case could have arrived at the conclusion, and once one assumes that they are an unreasonable jury, or they could not have reasonably come to the conclusion, then the convictions cannot stand.""


67The fourth was:

""4. Nevertheless, the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense [See Mercer v Commissioner for Road Transport and Tramways (NSW) (1936) 56 CLR 580 at 595; Ward v Roy W Sandford Ltd (1919) 19 SR (NSW) 172.]. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted [R v Wilkinson [1970] Crim LR 176]. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury [Hayes v The Queen (1973) 47 ALJR 603 at 604-605]. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt [R v Andrews Weatherfoil Ltd (1971) 56 Cr App R 31 at 40]. Alternatively, the appellate court may conclude that the jury took a ""merciful"" view of the facts upon one count: a function which has always been open to, and often exercised by, juries [R v Hunt [1968] 2 QB 433 at 436]. The early history of New South Wales was affected by English juries which, in the face of clear evidence, declined to find the value of goods stolen sufficient to attract the punishment of death, thereby affording to the offender the alternative punishment of transportation [Castles, An Australian Legal History (1982) at 56]. Australian decisions have acknowledged that the role of the jury continues to be ameliorative in this respect. In R v Kirkman [(1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593], in the Supreme Court of South Australia, King CJ (with the concurrence of Olsson and O'Loughlin JJ) observed:

""[J]uries cannot always be expected to act in accordance with strictly logical considerations and in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them, and courts, I think, must be very cautious about setting aside verdicts which are adequately supported by the evidence simply because a judge might find it difficult to reconcile them with the verdicts which had been reached by the jury with respect to other charges. Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.""


68The sixth proposition is that the onus falls on the applicant to establish inconsistency.

The directions

69In this case the jury was directed as to the elements of the various counts and the onus which fell on the Crown to establish each element. It was directed to consider each count separately and to consider the alternate counts, only if a unanimous decision that the sexual assault had not been proven was reached. An express warning against reaching compromise verdicts in respect of counts 2/3 and 4/5 was given. An explanation was given as to the evidence on which the Crown relied to establish the sexual assaults, including the results of the medical examinations and the evidence of Dr Tzioumi, which provided an explanation for why the complainant did not give evidence of penetration of her anus by the applicant's finger. The jury was instructed that:

""You will only draw the conclusion the Crown asks you to draw, that the lacerations were caused by the accused putting his finger into the child's anus, if you are satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt, and if you are satisfied that it is the only conclusion which can be drawn from the evidence beyond reasonable doubt. If you draw that conclusion it must be by a rational, logical thought process, not involving any speculation of conjecture. If you are of the view there is another reasonable explanation for the evidence of the lacerations than that the accused put his finger into [the complainant's] anus the Crown will not have proved those charges beyond reasonable doubt, and you must acquit the accused counts 2 and 4. The Crown submitted you will find there is no other reasonable explanation of the lacerations, when you consider Dr Tzioumi's evidence, than that they were caused by the accused penetrating [the complainant's] anus with his finger on each of the two occasions.
Counsel for the accused submitted that you could reasonably find that Dr Tzioumi's evidence' and [the complainant's] evidence established that the accused only touched her bottom, but did not penetrate her anus with his finger."" 


70The jury was also instructed as to the DNA evidence:

""The Crown asks you to conclude that the only reasonable explanation for the accused's DNA being on the inside of the back of [the complainant's] underpants is that he put saliva on his finger before putting it into [the complainant's] pants, and into her anus, and therefore you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that occurred. Mr O'Gorman-Hughes suggested the possibility of the accused's DNA being transferred because the accused touched the underpants [the complainant] put on at the beach. In order for you to find that that was a reasonable explanation for the accused's DNA being inside the back of [the complainant's] underpants you would have to have some evidence that the accused touched the underpants, and, as Madam Crown reminded you in her address, no witness gave any positive evidence that that occurred.
Mr O'Gorman-Hughes raised other possible explanations for you to consider for the accused's DNA being in [the complainant's] underpants; that the accused's DNA was transferred from his walking on the carpet where the underpants were later found, from [the complainant's] playing on the accused's mattress in the back of his van when they stopped at the shops on the way home from the beach, or from [the complainant's] jumping on the accused, given that Ms Trabuio said DNA can be found from a small number of cells.
Again you can only draw the conclusion the Crown asks you to draw if it can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt by a rational, logical thought process, and if it is the only conclusion to be drawn from the evidence, considered with all the other evidence, if, in your view, there is no other reasonable explanation of the evidence than that the accused's saliva was found on the back of the underpants, and got there in the way the Crown suggested. 
If you think that there is another reasonable explanation for the accused's saliva being on the inside of the back of [the complainant's] underpants than the one the Crown suggests then the Crown will not have satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt and you would find the accused not guilty of those charges.""


71Directions were also given as to the applicant's evidence, including as to his good character and how that could be taken into account. There was no suggestion on appeal that any of these directions were inadequate.

The evidence

72The jury had evidence before it of assaults during the course of two separate incidents. I have earlier outlined the complainant's evidence as to what occurred. The first occurred after the applicant had gone to the bathroom at about 10.40pm. The complainant could not say how long he was in her room, but her evidence was that the applicant's hands then felt wet. When he left she went back to sleep. Mrs BH heard the beads at the doorway to the bedroom being moved. She spoke to the applicant, but he explained that he had only swayed into the beads as he passed by. The second occurred during a period which was so long that the applicant's partner went to check on him. She then observed him coming out of the bedroom. Mrs BH spoke to him again and he gave her an account which left her concerned, so that she asked her husband to keep an eye on him and she went in and spoke to the complainant in her bedroom. 

The applicant's case is not established

73Again, the applicant relied on the complainant's denial of penetration and in relation to the theory of saliva being used as a lubricant, submitted that the only evidence of wetness possibly consistent with a lubricant, was in relation to the first incident, that being when the complainant said that she felt that the applicant's hands were wet.

74These submissions may not be accepted. As the Crown submitted, on the evidence the jury's verdicts are capable of rational explanation, consistent with the jury having followed the direction to consider the prosecution case in respect of each count separately. Consistently with that approach, the jury appears to have given the applicant the benefit of doubt in respect of count 2. 

75That could have been the result of a reasoning process which considered that the nature of the lacerations; the complainant's evidence, when considered with Dr Tzioumi's evidence as to how as the lacerations could be caused; and the DNA evidence, provided a cogent basis for the conclusion that the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had penetrated the complainant's anus, but that it had not established two such acts of sexual intercourse. That, it seems to me, provides an obvious explanation of the differences between the verdicts on the two sexual intercourse counts.

76It was open to the jury to conclude that there had been penetration. Given the nature of the lacerations, the jury could also have concluded that they were inflicted on only one occasion and that it was more likely that this occurred during the second incident.

77On the evidence it was open to the jury to reason that having in mind the amount of applicant's DNA found in the underpants, together with saliva, the applicant had not used saliva during the first incident, when his hands were still wet, after going to the bathroom, but that this had occurred during the second incident, when the lacerations were inflicted and his DNA deposited in a considerable amount on the inside of the underpants. 

78In those circumstances, it cannot be concluded that no reasonable jury which applied its mind to the evidence, could have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt on count 5, the second sexual intercourse charge, notwithstanding their unwillingness to convict him on the first, count 3. Indeed, on the evidence, that might have reflected a merciful outcome. 

79In those circumstances, it must be concluded that the onus falling on the applicant in respect of this ground has not been met.

Orders

80For the reasons given I would order:

1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
2. The appeal be dismissed.

1HOEBEN JA: I agree with Beech-Jones J and the orders which he proposes.

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Beech-Jones J.

3BEECH-JONES J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from an evidentiary ruling of his Honour Judge Nicholson SC. After a voir dire, his Honour excluded certain ""DNA evidence"" sought to be relied on by the Crown. His Honour relied on s 135(b), 135(c) and s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.

The Crown Case

4The respondent has been charged with one count of detaining a person for advantage (s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900) and two counts of aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years (s 61M(2)). All of the offences concern the same child and are alleged to have occurred on 6 February 2011. What follows is a brief précis of what the Crown anticipates it can prove at the respondent's trial.

5The complainant was six years old at the time of the alleged offence. She was playing with another child, a boy, in the garden area of the block of units where she lived.

6A man approached them and told the boy to go pick up some leaves. The man then took the complainant by the hand and pulled her underneath the building into a dark area of a secluded parking area (count 1). He indecently assaulted her by pulling down her underpants and touching her vulva and bottom (counts 2 and 3). The young boy saw her being taken and ran to her parent's flat. Her father came down to the area calling for her. At that point the offender fled without being seen by any adult witnesses. The complainant's father then drove around the area to find the offender. 

7Meanwhile a neighbour phoned the police about a vehicle that was blocking entry to his garage. He gave police the registration number. A man later approached the vehicle. The neighbour told him that the police had been called. He became agitated and drove off immediately. The complainant's father was not present at that time.

8The police were notified of the assault on the complainant. The complainant was medically examined that evening and some swabs were taken for DNA testing.

9The young boy described the offender as tall and a ""little bit fat"" with a diamond in his cheek and black spiky hair. He said he was wearing a short-sleeved blue shirt and shorts. The complainant told police on the same evening that the offender had pictures on his arms and three piercings on his face. The next day she made a statement and described the offender as wearing a white T-shirt with some black at the front, with short black spiky hair. He was tall and skinny with white skin and had ""things you put on your ears on his cheek"" - ""one big, one medium and one small"".

10Police enquiries revealed that the registered owner of the vehicle had sold it to the respondent about a month earlier. None of the witnesses who saw the man who drove the vehicle away described him as having facial piercings. Nor did any of them identify the respondent from an array of photographs shown to them. It was not the Crown case that the man who collected the vehicle was necessarily the respondent.

11The respondent was apprehended three days later, on 9 February 2011. Forensic procedure photographs taken of him on that day showed that he has tattoos on his forearms and hands, and three studs in a row on his cheek.

12A buccal swab was also taken from the respondent. It was sent to the Division of Analytical Laboratories (""DAL"") for analysis, together with the clothing worn by the complainant and a comparison sample taken from the complainant's father.

13A fingerprint was located on the outside of a toilet door in the parking area of the building, the scene of the assault. It matched a man who was interviewed by police. He did not physically resemble the respondent, and he gave an explanation as to the circumstances in which his fingerprint may have been left there.

14Absent the DNA evidence which I will describe, it can be seen the Crown had evidence connecting the respondent to the offence, although it has its limitations. The car at the scene was owned by the respondent, however none of the adult witnesses who saw it driven away identified the respondent as the driver. Both children described the offender as having piercings in his cheek but they could not specifically identify the respondent.

The DNA Evidence

15The swabs from the complainant and the respondent were subject to analysis by the DAL. Counsel at first instance and his Honour used the phrase ""DNA Evidence"" to describe the evidence the Crown sought to adduce as to the analysis undertaken, the results and any explanation necessary to explain them. I am using the same terminology.

16The DNA evidence was given on behalf of the Crown by a DAL analyst, Ms Michele Franco. She provided a report which contained, inter alia, a description of the testing undertaken on the underpants and shorts of the complainant. The critical parts of her report concerned testing on ""area 2aii"", being the hip area of the complainant's underpants, and ""area 2bi"", being the ""left hip area of the shorts"". The report described the results of the testing on those areas as follows:

""2aii Hip area of underpants

DNA testing (using the Profiler Plus System) was conducted. The DNA present in the major component is consistent with originating from [the complainant]. The DNA present in the minor component is too weak and complex to determine the profiles of the individual contributors. [The respondent] could not be excluded as a minor contributor to this mixture.

Additional DNA testing using the Y-filer System was conducted. DNA from at least two males was recovered. Assuming two males are present in the mixture and a male from the paternal line of [the complainant's father] is also present, then the profile of the second male contributor has been determined. [The respondent] cannot be excluded as the second male contributor. In addition, all male relatives on his paternal line and approximately 1 in 630 unrelated males in the general population cannot be excluded.

...

2bi Left hip area of shorts

DNA testing using the Profiler Plus System was conducted. The DNA present in the major component is consistent with originating from [the complainant]. The DNA present in the minor component is too weak and complex to determine the profiles of the individual contributors.

Additional DNA testing using the Y-filer System was conducted and recovered DNA from at least three male individuals. This profile is too complex to determine the profiles of the individual contributors."" (emphasis added)

17Material tendered before his Honour indicated that the DAL undertook DNA analysis by a ""PCR"" (Polymerase Chain Reaction) method. This involves targeting specific areas of the DNA and copying or amplifying those targeted regions many millions of times. One common PCR procedure involves determining the size variation that exists at specific DNA sites due to short tandem repeats (""STR""). The ""Profiler Plus"" system referred to in the above report is the brand name of a particular DNA recognition system which utilises the STR procedure. According to his Honour ""it is the system overwhelmingly used in New South Wales"". It involves the targeting of what are described as ""nine highly valuable areas of the DNA and one area determining gender"". In her evidence on the voir dire Ms Franco explained that the Profiler Plus system examined nine different chromosomes. Nothing turns upon any difference in these descriptions (if there is any).

18The other method referred to in the above extract from the DAL report is the ""Y-filer"" system. It uses the same technology as the Profiler Plus system but only targets the Y chromosome in the gender pair of chromosomes. It is said to be useful when the DNA recovered is a mixture of both male and female DNA (as females do not possess a Y chromosome). An expert called by the defence on the voir dire, Professor Boettcher, stated as follows:

""A way of envisaging the Y-filer system is to imagine the Y chromosome as a string of beads of different colours. In a group of men, each has a string of beads - but, the colours of the beads are in a different order for each of the men. 

Within the small group of unrelated men, no two have identical strings of beads. Some beads might be identical, but other beads on the strings will be different.

In a large population, there may be two (or more) men who have identical strings of beads.

When a man has a son, he copies his string of beads and gives each son an identical copy of his string of beads. The strings of beads are passed from generation to generation as whole strings, not on a bead by bead basis.""

19Each of the two procedures can be used to exclude a person as a match. If two samples yield a ""match"" then it could mean that they are either the same individual or they match by chance. Both systems enable a statistical estimate to be made of the likelihood of a chance match. This is done by a comparison with a population database. However, there are significant differences between the statistical results commonly yielded by the two methods.

20Ms Franco explained that, with the Profiler Plus system, for each of the nine areas of DNA, a frequency of the occurrence of the result is obtained from the population database. These frequencies are multiplied and usually result in an extremely high statistical likelihood of the two samples being from the same person and a correspondingly low likelihood of a chance of identical DNA for two different people. This was described in the evidence as the ""product method"".

21With the Y-filer system there is only one area of DNA targeted, namely the Y chromosome. The population database is examined to determine the rate of frequency of the one characteristic that is identified. This was referred to in the voir dire as a ""counting method"" (see also Aytugrul v R [2010] NSWCCA 272; 205 A Crim R 157 at [144] to [146], per Simpson J).

22Ms Franco explained that the population database for the Y-filer results was comprised of 1889 people consisting of four major population groups, Aboriginal, Middle Eastern, European and Asian. There was no correspondence between the respondent's profile and any entry on the database. She explained that the result of taking a negative match with a sample of 1889 and using a 95% confidence interval, yielded the figure of 1 in 630 set out in her report. To this likelihood must be added all male relatives on the respondent's paternal lines to reflect the passing of identical Y chromosomes from father to son. Professor Boettcher did not disagree with that methodology but disputed the result of the calculation. He contended that the appropriate figure was 1 in 512.

The Voir Dire

23The matter was listed for trial on Wednesday 14 March 2012. The respondent had previously withdrawn his lawyers' instructions and only re-instructed them in the week prior to the trial commencing. His counsel was only engaged at the last minute. They accessed subpoenaed material from the Crown concerning the DAL test reports relied on by Ms Franco on the day before the trial was listed. It seems that Professor Boettcher was also only engaged just prior to the trial. He produced a short report on the day of the trial which made some useful comments but stated that he had not sufficient time to set out all of his concerns. Both Ms Franco and Professor Boettcher gave evidence before his Honour on 15 March 2012. His Honour handed down judgment on 19 March 2012.

24I have already described parts of the evidence from Ms Franco and Professor Boettcher given on the voir dire. It is necessary to briefly note four further points concerning the voir dire.

25First, Professor Boettcher was critical of that part of Ms Franco's evidence which concerned the results of the Profiler Plus system on area 2aii (the hip area of the underpants) and the respondent's DNA. Ms Franco's report stated the respondent ""could not be excluded as a minor contributor"" to the mixture of DNA found in that area, although she did not provide any accompanying statistical assessment. Professor Boettcher considered the data was ""incoherent"". I refer to this dispute below at [30] to [34].

26Secondly, it is to be recalled that the Y-filer results for area 2aii were based on two assumptions. The first was that only two sets of male DNA were present; and the second was that one of those sets belonged to the complainant's father (see [16] above). In chief Ms Franco explained that the basis for the latter assumption was that it was ""often ... the case that people in the family had DNA present on each other's clothes"". Ms Franco did not provide any basis for the former assumption. Her report stated that DNA from ""at least two males"" were present and had identified DNA ""from at least three male individuals"" present in area 2bi (the hip area of the complainant's shorts).

27Third, Ms Franco was not cross-examined about either the validity of those assumptions or the effect of their potential invalidation on the conclusions in her report concerning the Y-filer results for area 2aii, eg if there was DNA from three males present on the hip area of the complainant's underpants did that make the Y chromosome ""match"" meaningless? How would her conclusions differ if she assumed that there were three contributors to area 2aii? Professor Boettcher did not address the significance of those assumptions either.

28Fourth, it was not submitted to his Honour that the unsafeness of the assumptions adopted by Ms Franco warranted the exclusion of the DNA evidence. Instead counsel for the respondent emphasised the prejudice to his client that would follow from the receipt of evidence suggesting that there was only a ""1 in 500"" to ""1 in 600"" chance that the probability of the Y chromosome match was only a co-incidence and not because the DNA on the complainant's underpants came from the respondent.

His Honour's Judgment

29In his judgment, his Honour described the Crown case and the evidence of Ms Franco concerning the use of the Profiler Plus system before summarising her evidence concerning the Y-filer system and its limitations. Two points should be noted about his Honour's recitation of this material.

30First, the Crown complains that his Honour misstated Ms Franco' evidence concerning the results of the Profiler Plus system when his Honour stated:

""15 In her oral evidence Ms Franco acknowledged that the Profiler Plus system was unable to determine the profile of the minor contributors. Therefore, there was nothing for the Profiler Plus system to work upon to work out a statistical LR. In the absence of statistics from Profiler Plus she was unable to exclude the accused. Indeed, she was unable to offer any opinion one way or the other in respect of any of the nine DNA chromosome positions. She chose to go to another system and further testing in order, she says, to give some weight. We normally would not write, Cannot exclude without having some sort of statistic.

16 Frankly, that evidence is suspect. It is to be noted the DNA minor component inside the crotch of the underpants (2ai); the DNA minor component on the other hip area (2aiii); the DNA minor component of the left hip area of the shorts (2bi) and the DNA minor component on the right hip area, (2bi) have all been described as, ""This profile is too complex to determine the profile of the individual contributor."" Indeed, in respect of the right hip area, the material does not even appear to have been subjected to a Y-filer profile test."" (emphasis added)

31The question and answer to which his Honour was referring to in [15] was the following:

""Q. What is the reason that there's no statistic expressed there? [ie in her report concerning area 2aii and Profiler Plus]

A. Because the profile of the minor contributors could not be determined, therefore there was nothing to - to actually work out a statistic. So all I'm saying is that, at each of the DNA - nine DNA positions, I couldn't exclude him but have gone on to do further testing in order to give some sort of weight. We normally would not write, 'Cannot exclude without having some sort of statistic.' ""

32The Crown complains that his Honour has misunderstood Ms Franco as having written ""cannot exclude"" in circumstances where she was ""unable to offer any opinion"". It submits that she in fact stated there was enough data on the Profiler Plus system to allow her to form a limited opinion but not one to which she could attach any statistical significance (hence her reliance on the Y-filer system). Mr Stratton SC for the respondent pointed to the apparent contradiction in Ms Franco's report on area 2aii between, on the one hand, the statement that the DNA sample was too weak and complex to determine profiles and, on the other, the statement that the respondent could not be excluded as a minor contributor to the DNA mixture (see [16] above). He relied on Professor Boettcher's criticism of this aspect of Ms Franco's report that I have described above. In effect it was contended that his Honour's comments reflect the force of Professor Boettcher's criticism.

33I think there is considerable force in both sets of contentions. It seems to me that his Honour did misstate Ms Franco's evidence in this respect, although it is difficult to reconcile the statements that Mr Stratton SC pointed to. Further, it is difficult to see the utility for the Crown's case of a bare statement that a person cannot be excluded if it does not have any statistical significance attached to it.

34It is unnecessary for me to consider that further because, contrary to the Crown's submissions, I do not consider that any error on his Honour's part has any significance to his Honour's ultimate decision to exclude the DNA evidence. As I will explain it was the Y-filer results that were critical to that conclusion. If the results of the Y-filer analysis were excluded then, whatever be the correct analysis of Ms Franco's evidence concerning the Profiler Plus results (or lack of them), those results did not provide any assistance to the Crown case.

35Second, his Honour identified the difficulties with the Y-filer results flowing from the two assumptions set out in Ms Franco's report that I have referred to earlier. His Honour noted that the assumption that the complainant's father was one of the contributors was not supported by the Profiler Plus results and it was otherwise not so obvious that he would have contact with his daughter's clothing that it could be inferred without further evidence. The Profiler Plus results were neutral on the former issue and the latter criticism has some force. In addition, his Honour expressed concerns about the quality of DNA available for the Y-filer results and then noted the assumption that DNA from only two males was present on area 2aii was just that, namely an assumption and not a matter proved by Ms Franco.

36However, these matters did not ultimately inform his Honour's decision. Instead his Honour concluded:

""36 ... In my view there is a real likelihood the probative value of this evidence is outweighed by unfair prejudice. The danger arises thus:

1 The Profiler Plus system overwhelmingly used in New South Wales and indeed used in this case was unable to separate out of the minor components nine DNA profiles matching the accused. The reason for this is the minor DNA component was too weak and complex to determine the profile of any individual.

2 It would seem the Profiler Plus results did reveal that the minor component was blended DNA.

3 It seems the Profiler Plus did not reveal the potential numbers of contributors to the minor component or their gender.

4 It seems the Profiler Plus was unable to catalogue the blend of the minor component into a dominant donor or a minor donor(s) of the DNA composing the minor component.

5 The Y-filer system's use so far as the DAL laboratories is concerned is focused upon its use as an excluder of DNA contribution. That is to say its forensic use is not from the DAL's perspective one dependent upon RL's [relative likelihood] of inclusion.

6 In this case the use of the Yfiler analysis has been harnessed for the purposes of matching a profile and determining (using a counting method) the RL of a donor being the crime stain donor.

7 The Y filer system focuses upon one chromosome only by contrast with the nine chromosomes relied upon by the Profiler Plus.

8 There is no uniqueness in the possession of the Y chromosome. All male relatives on the paternal line are highly likely to pass the same Y chromosome DNA profile in the absence of mutation.

9 The determination of the RL of such male relatives in the Westmead area known or unknown is a matter of speculation. What impact that has upon the RL figure be that figure 1 in 630 males or 1 in 512 males is hopelessly speculative. Indeed, the figures 1 in 630 or 1 in 512 may be misleading. Working on the RL figure of 1 in 630 that leaves open a potential of three and a half thousand males in the Sydney population of 4.5 million as having the same Y chromosome DNA profile. For each of those three and a half thousand males given that it is the Y chromosome that matches all male relatives on the paternal side of that match will also have the same Y chromosome.

10 It is likely the profile comparison from the crime stained DNA is an incomplete profile for comparison where 17 points of comparison is the norm.

11 There is criticism offered by Professor Boettcher in respect of comparisons of the heights of minor eliors [sic] at three loci sites. Professor Boettcher says there are, ""Further comments to be made in the same vein"" claiming that time did not permit him to make them given the speed with which the report was required.

37 Should all of the information that has been placed before me be conveyed to the jury and assuming it is understood by the jury, the probative value of the DNA evidence standing alone as a circumstance of identification would be verging on the unreliable and the meaningless.

38 The results of the Profiler Plus analysis were inconclusive. The accused was not excluded as a potential donor nor was the Profiler Plus able to match his DNA profile. The Y-filer results in the circumstances of this case may not be much better.

39 However, given the CSI effect, the time it would take to ventilate all this material in the evidence-in-chief, cross-examination and exhibits such as VD 3, 4 and 5, there is a real likelihood the jury would give far more weight to this evidence than it deserves. It would assume a weight equal to other pieces of identification evidence that are more capable of and have more cogency and stronger probative force."" (emphasis added)

(The reference to the ""CSI effect"" appears to be a reference to the risk that greater weight is attached to forensic evidence than is warranted: see Morgan v R [2011] NSWCCA 257 at [145] per Hidden J).

37His Honour excluded the evidence under s 137 (probative value outweighed by unfair prejudice), s 135(b) (misleading or confusing evidence) and s 137(c) (evidence might result in undue waste of time). His Honour relied on the latter provision after having assessed the likely time that the receipt and analysis of this evidence would occupy at the trial.

38Although three bases for exclusion were stated, they all have as their foundation his Honour's conclusion that the ""probative value of the DNA evidence standing alone as a circumstance of identification would be verging on the unreliable and meaningless."" In turn this conclusion was said to result from ""all the information"" listed in [36] of the judgment. With one exception, the points listed in [36] all concern the relative advantages of the Profiler Plus system compared with the Y-filer system (points 1 to 8 and 10) and the apparently speculative and misleading nature of frequency ratios in the range 1 in 512 to 1 in 630 (point 9). The one exception is the eleventh point in [36] of his Honour's judgment, which concerned a criticism of Ms Franco's report by Professor Boettcher. It is not clear whether his Honour accepted that criticism but it does not matter. Those comments of Professor Boettcher did not concern the Y-profiler results. Instead they were directed to debate about the Profiler Plus results that I have already discussed (see [25] and [30] to [34] above). 

Aytugrul v R [2012] HCA 15

39In Aytugrul the appellant was charged with murder. He was accused of stabbing the deceased. Expert evidence was adduced at his trial that he had a particular DNA profile (a mitochondrial haplotype) and that the same haplotype was detected in a hair found under the nail of the deceased. The expert stated the mitochondrial sequence identified in the hair sample had not been observed in any of the 4839 individuals listed on the relevant population database (Aytugrul v R [2012] HCA 15; 86 ALJR 474 at [9]). Using a similar approach to that adopted in this case, this translated to a frequency ratio of 1 in 1600 persons as being expected to have the same DNA profile as that of the appellant. This translated to 99.9% of the population being excluded (an ""exclusion percentage"").

40At trial objection was taken to the evidence of the expert extrapolating from the comparison with the database to expressing either a frequency ratio or an exclusive percentage (at [10]). The objection was overruled. On appeal to this Court, the appellant argued, inter alia, that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the use of the exclusion percentage as opposed to the frequency ratio even though one was a mathematical mirror image of the other. By a majority this contention was rejected by this Court (Aytugrul v R [2010] NSWCCA 272; 205 A Crim R 157 at [198], per Simpson J, at [238], per Fullerton J contra McClellan CJ at CL at [99]). It was further rejected on appeal to the High Court (Aytugrul v R [2012] HCA 15; ALJR 474).

41In both this Court and the High Court it was contended that ""evidence"" of the exclusion percentages should have been rejected under s 135 and s 137 as being misleading or prejudicial. This contention was framed at a level of generality that suggested that in every case an exclusion percentage should be rejected because its probative value is always outweighed by the degree of unfair prejudice occasioned by it being admitted ([2012] HCA 15; ALJR 474 at [19] - [20], per French CJ, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ). The plurality judgment (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ) rejected this contention:

""30. The unfair prejudice said to arise in this case was alleged to flow from the use of a percentage figure, which carried a 'residual risk of unfairness deriving from the subliminal impact of the raw percentage figures' by way of rounding up the percentage figure to 100. If the exclusion percentage were to be examined in isolation, the appellant's arguments appear to take on some force. But to carry out the relevant inquiry in that way would be erroneous. In this case, both the frequency ratio and the manner in which the exclusion percentage had been derived from the frequency ratio were to be explained in evidence to the jury. The risk of unfair prejudice - described by the appellant as the jury giving the exclusion percentage 'more weight ... than it deserved' - was all but eliminated by the explanation. It is not right, as the submissions of the appellant implicitly urged, and as appears to have been the approach taken in R v GK, to assess the danger of unfair prejudice by reference only to the exclusion percentage, ignoring all other evidence. In assessing the danger of unfair prejudice to a defendant, regard must be had to the whole of the evidence that is to be given, particularly by the witness to whose evidence objection is taken. When that is done in this case, recognising, in particular, the evidence that it was proposed to lead from the witness about the derivation of the exclusion percentage, there was no danger of unfair prejudice that required rejection of the exclusion percentage.

...

32. There may be cases where evidence given of exclusion percentages may warrant close consideration of the application of s 135 or s 137 (or, where applicable, equivalent common law doctrines or statutory provisions). These reasons are not to be read as suggesting to the contrary. Evidence given about the results of DNA analysis is evidence about comparisons between identified samples and one or more databases. The results of those comparisons can be expressed qualitatively or quantitatively. If expressed quantitatively there are assumptions and approximations made which often (perhaps always) require elucidation and explanation to make plain what are the limits to the opinion that is being expressed as a number or range of numbers. Just as evidence of an opinion given by an expert must, in order to satisfy the requirements of admissibility in s 79(1) of the Evidence Act, be ""presented in a form which makes it possible to answer"" the question posed by that provision, it will usually be important, even necessary, that the evidence provides the jury with so much of the expert's ""specialised knowledge"" as the jury requires properly to understand the opinion expressed - and what it can and cannot demonstrate - and that this specialised knowledge be related to the facts of the case.

...

34. In this case, where both the frequency ratio and the exclusion percentage were given, and the relationship of one to the other was explained, there was neither a wrong decision of any question of law nor on any other ground a miscarriage of justice."" (citations omitted)

42These passages emphasise that a consideration of the entirety of the evidence to be relied on is required in determining whether a particular piece of evidence is prejudicial. In Aytugrul, the evidence of exclusive percentages was accompanied by a frequency ratio as well as by explanations as to how they were derived and what they meant. None of that evidence was found to be either misleading or inaccurate or as having the capacity to mislead the jury (see also Heydon J at [75] - [77]).

Consideration

43The High Court's decision in Aytugrul was not handed down until after his Honour's judgment. However, his Honour was referred to the judgment of this Court in Aytugrul ""as supportive for the proposition that [a ratio likelihood, ie frequency ratios] in the low thousands is admissible for the purpose of identification"". His Honour distinguished this Court's decision in Aytugrul on two bases. First, his Honour noted that Aytugrul was not a case where ss 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act were relied on at trial. Secondly his Honour noted that the DNA profile considered in Aytugrul did not have the ""concerns"" that Ms Franco had identified with the samples in this case.

44It follows from the above that I consider there is force in this second basis but it did not ultimately inform his Honour's decision to exclude the DNA evidence. However, with respect to his Honour, the first basis was not a proper reason for distinguishing the decision of this Court in Aytugrul. While ss 135 and 137 were not relied on and considered at trial in Aytugrul, they were relied on and considered in this Court (see [2010] NSWCCA 272; 205 A Crim R 157 at [171] to [172], [194] and [198], per Simpson J) and that consideration was binding on his Honour. In any event the matter is now to be considered in light of the High Court's judgment in Aytugrul.

45I have extracted and summarised the critical part of his Honour's reasons for excluding the DNA evidence above. One aspect of his Honour's assessment of the evidence as ""verging on the unreliable and the meaningless"" was that it was of less rigour than the results from the Profiler Plus system in the sense of producing lower frequency ratios. This may be the case but that does not render it unreliable or meaningless, much less identify ""prejudice"" for the purposes of s 137 or make it ""misleading"" for the purpose of s 135.

46Ultimately what was critical to his Honour's decision was the conclusion in point 9 of paragraph [36] of his Honour's judgment (extracted in [36] above) that frequency ratios in the order of 1 in 512 or 1 in 630 are ""hopelessly speculative"" or ""misleading"". His Honour said that they leave open a ""potential of three and a half thousand males in the Sydney population of 4.5 million as having the same Y chromosome DNA profile"". This calculation may be correct but that does not make the ratio ""hopelessly speculative"" or ""misleading"" especially if it was accompanied by an explanation from Ms Franco as to how she arrived at that figure and what it meant. Leaving aside the assumptions to which I have referred, Ms Franco's report suggests that a particular Y chromosome is a characteristic shared by the respondent and a person who has been in contact with the complainant's underpants. In one sense this characteristic is conceptually no different to the cheek piercings and jewellery that are common to the respondent and the offender as identified by the complainant and the young boy witness. They all form part of a matrix of facts from which the jury might, but not necessarily would, draw a conclusion adverse to the respondent to the appropriate standard.

47The difference between the piercings and the Y chromosome is that with the former the jury can make their own common sense assessment of the frequency of occurrence of such a feature. They cannot do the same with a common Y chromosome. To assist them in that task a straightforward, precise and accurate expert explanation is required which can include frequency ratios and exclusion percentages. His Honour considered that the danger of figures in the form of frequency ratios carried with it too much risk of a misunderstanding by the jury. Hence his Honour later stated that the ""witness box is not a classroom"" and that, based on his Honour's experience, ""it is unlikely a jury hearing evidence of DNA issues in this case would retire to the jury room with an accurate précis of the evidence in their minds."" His Honour's experience in this area is considerable. However, with respect to his Honour, this reasoning is inconsistent with the High Court's judgment in AytugruI. The judgment in Aytugrul rejected the suggestion that an exclusion percentage was necessarily prejudicial, finding that it could be and was the subject of an accurate explanation to the jury which they were capable of understanding ([2012] HCA 15; 86 ALJR 474 at [30] and [75]). Those observations apply with even greater force to a frequency ratio.

48In my view, his Honour's finding in this case that the ""probative value of the DNA evidence standing alone as a circumstance of identification would be verging on the unreliable and the meaningless"" was erroneous. It follows from the High Court's judgment in Aytugrul that, provided it was properly and clearly explained, DNA evidence of the kind considered here could be of assistance to, and understood, by the jury. For the same reasons the prejudice his Honour identified for the purposes of s 137 of the Evidence Act also does not survive the judgment in Aytugrul. These conclusions are more than sufficient to vitiate his Honour's rejection of the evidence under s 137. Further, they have the consequence that the exercise of his Honour's discretion under s 135 miscarried. In concluding that the DNA evidence would be ""misleading"" because of the frequency ratio and that its admission would cause an ""undue"" waste of time, his Honour acted on both a ""wrong principle"" and a mistake as to the facts (House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, at 504 - 505).

49In seeking to resist the appeal Mr Stratton SC made a number of powerful submissions concerning the effect of Professor Boettcher's evidence and the validity of the assumptions made by Ms Franco. I have already referred to those matters and I refer to them further below. The difficulty is that, although his Honour referred to those issues in his judgment, they did not ultimately play any significant part in his Honour's decision to reject the DNA evidence. The extract I have set out above makes it clear that his Honour had a fundamental objection to the admission of frequency ratios of the kind yielded by the Y-filer analysis. This reflected the manner in which the matter was argued. It follows from Aytugrul that that objection had no proper basis in principle.

50It may be a basis for resisting a Crown appeal under s 5F(3A) that the respondent can demonstrate that, even if the trial judge's reasoning was flawed, the evidence in question still should have been rejected. This would be a difficult threshold to meet in the case of a discretionary decision to exclude evidence. Although, as I have said, a number of doubts were raised about the evidence other than the relatively low frequency ratio, I am not satisfied that the evidence must have been rejected in any event. No doubt due to the late preparation and the focus on the frequency ratio these doubts were not fully explored during the voir dire.

51For the Crown to succeed on an appeal under s 5F(3A) the Court must be satisfied that the decision or ruling ""eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution case"". This is to be determined on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence and without any investigation into the weight of the evidence based on any credibility or reliability considerations (R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 at [40], per Spigelman CJ). The rejection of the DNA evidence that I have described removed an important plank of a circumstantial Crown case on identification. I am satisfied that it substantially weakened the prosecution case.

Further challenges

52It follows that I consider that the appeal should be allowed and that his Honour's rejection of the DNA evidence should be set aside. As should be otherwise obvious, nothing in this judgment is meant to preclude any reconsideration of the admissibility of the DNA evidence in this case, especially when Professor Boettcher has had the opportunity to provide a more considered report.

53Further, and without limiting the scope for further challenge, it may be that either or both of the two assumptions adopted by Ms Franco cannot be supported. It also may be that the Y-filer results are meaningless if either or both are not established. If that were the case there would be considerable room for doubt as to whether the DNA evidence met the threshold for admissibility in s 55 of the Evidence Act even before any consideration need be given to its rejection under ss 135 or 137.

54The orders I propose are:

(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)The judgment of Judge Nicholson SC, dated 19 March 2012, be set aside.

2759383,R v Elturk [2012] NSWDC 275,"Judgment

1John Elturk was committed for trial upon three charges, namely that on 3 January 2011 at West Hoxton in the State of New South Wales, he did steal a knife, the property of Woolworths Limited; then that on 3 January 2011 at Hoxton Park in the State of New South Wales did wound Sohail Elturk with intent to murder the said Sohail Elturk; and finally, at the same time and place, he did wound Sohail Elturk with an intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

2Those charges were placed upon an indictment and pleas of guilty were entered to counts 1 and 3, and accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment.

3On 4 June, that is, yesterday, Mr Elturk was before me for sentence. Then a most unusual application was made by the Crown. When I say unusual, I do not mean that I am critical of it, but the application was one that I would reject the guilty plea and require Mr Elturk to stand his trial, on the basis that a more appropriate outcome for this litigation would be a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness.

4The application was opposed by the defence, who sought to proceed upon the pleas of guilty.

5The facts alleged by the Crown are set out in the would-be Crown brief on sentence. I will refer to them in a moment. It is fair to say the defence do not dispute these allegations.

ALLEGED FACTS

6I will start at paragraph 4.

On 3 January 2011, at approximately 12.30pm, the offender attended the Big W store at Hoxton Park and stole a chef's knife from that store. He went from there to the family home at Hoxton Park, arriving at approximately 1.30pm, with the knife. At the time, the victim, namely, the offender's father, was in the living room of the house, sitting on a single seater lounge chair, watching a DVD. Two other persons were also seated nearby, watching the same DVD.


The offender approached from behind and placed a hand on the victim's forehead and tilted his head back. The victim was not unfamiliar with that action and thought it was his wife about to kiss him. He looked down and saw something shiny. The offender then ran a blade across the victim's neck from right to left, causing a wound, commencing from the middle of the throat to a point near the right ear.



The victim looked down and saw blood on the knife. He then got up from the chair and saw the offender standing with a knife in his right hand. The victim noted that the offender looked like he was in a trance, with an emotionless and expressionless face. The victim asked the offender, ""Why did you do that?"" to which the offender replied, ""I had to do that. You are the devil."" The victim again asked, ""Why did you do that? What's happened to you? Did anyone hurt you?"" The offender again stated, ""You are the devil. I had to do that.""

7What prompted the prosecution application, as best I can tell, was the record of interview given by the accused on the day of the knife attack, and a psychiatric report from Dr Nielssen dated 30 May, served on the prosecution by the defence. No doubt that has been done as a pre-requisite of its being tendered by the defence on sentence.

8Relevantly from the record of interview are the following passages.

9Question and answer 35, which is a very long answer, and I certainly do not intend to quote it all, but rather to give some flavour of it.

10The question was in these terms:

""Q. Can you tell me about what happened today? Just take your time.

A. All, all of my life I've had, I wake up in the morning and feeling like, really like, I do anything wrong all my life, you know, and, but I feel really sick, you know, like totally tortured with, like in pounding, like a feelings, you know what I mean, like...cruelties and things, you know, from when I was young, and I, and I never, I never actually go to the toilet, it was very strange, you know, like I, I like, the only time I went to the toilet is if I had breakfast, and when I was at the...the Tyringham house, I, I, for three, for three months, I locked my doors and windows and everything, and put screws in the windows and everything, and I actually...""


The rest of that answer is equally bizarre and unfocused.

11Question and answer 40 - the question, in effect, that he was asked was:

""Q. What happened when you went to your father's place today?

A. Yeah, yeah, when I went there today, I just went to protect myself, like when, when, when he, when, when, when I was at the, the, the church, something, you know, the power, the powerful, this name what, you know, devil name, I don't want to say, 'cause it's not nice to say, but--


Q. It's okay, you can say it.

A. I don't want to say it, you know, but whatever they're putting in me, you know what I mean, I was at the church, you know, 'cause I always used to go to church all the time, but they, I want to go home...in me, you know what I mean, 'cause of what they were doing to me in my sleep, and I, I just went sick, you know, trying...it's like pure evil, this thing, you know what I mean, and it's like...such a sickness in me, I, I, I, when I did this, I become safe from it. Not safe, but it didn't affect me as bad, you know what I mean, 'cause God had mercy for me to...protect me from 'em, and then...today...whatever...this person is, you know, in the, in the 'cause the, when I was in that room and he was doing that to me in my sleep after three days, I, I, I couldn't control myself, like, I've always been able to control myself,""

and so on, again fairly disconnected.

12The Crown Prosecutor drew to my attention ten other sites in the record of interview that were particularly focused on events that had occurred within the accused's father's home, where the answers indicated bizarre thinking.

13In respect of those answer 241:

""I said to him [the father] I said, 'You're a devil, you know,' this is really, you know what I mean, I had to confront it, you know, and then I realised, well, maybe somehow I can get someone to help me. I know, I don't know, like, if you're physically connected to, you know, you know what I mean, I've got, like, I've got a good closeness to the Holy Spirit and everything, but it was...these are filthy, like, abominable people, you know what I mean? You should see 'em, you know.""

14And the answer to 253:

""I honestly, I honestly conformed, 'cause I just want everything nice that dad, to see if he's all right. He, he, he's [the father] you know, maybe I can get a peaceful resolve, then when I finally, when I really, really confirmed that I, I'll find a peaceful resolve, all of a sudden, everyone jumped in, jumped in everything, and all of these policemen jumped on me, so really I think it's some sort of about faith, faith, you know, cleansing, you know, like I've got, like I got, I got to get rid of him or something, I don't know what to do, you know. They're scary, you know.""

15The report of Dr Nielssen, which was the second item that, as I said, contributed to the Crown seeking to have the plea rejected, makes the following observation. This is the first report, 30 May 2012:

""Mr Elturk said that the offence occurred during an exacerbation of mental illness that had developed over a period of several months, that had become especially severe in the week before the offence. However, he said that he did not want to enter a plea of not guilty to mental illness because he said, 'I don't want to be caught for six or seven years in the forensic system'...


He said that he was unable to sleep for four nights, and on the night before the offence, stayed at the nearby Mercure Hotel because he was afraid to be in his flat. He said that shortly before the offence he had been standing in the middle of a sports field screaming, and said, 'I was trying to push away the entities that had entered my system'. He confirmed that the next day he ['bought'] a knife at a supermarket, went to his father's house and attacked him with a knife, cutting the skin of his neck. He said he could not remember if any words were exchanged, but agreed he might have called his father the devil. He said that it was not a penetrating injury and that his father recovered.


Mr Elturk said that, 'Around that time I was in a psychosis...supernatural things were happening...I had some powerful delusions...I felt I could communicate with people spiritually...there was a lot of supernatural activity in my life...the Lord's name had a powerful impact on me...I felt confused about my father...I went to the Liverpool Hospital afterwards because I was so scared...I was on my way to the police when they arrested me.'


He said that, 'At the time [of the offence] there was a powerful cruelty on me...I was under the impression I had to do it...I submitted to that...I didn't want to do it...I didn't press [on the knife while cutting]...I didn't want to kill my father.' He said that he loved his father and was conscious not to press too hard, and said, 'I just did it to get relief from my situation'. He said that at the time of the offence itself he felt as though that time had slowed right down and that 'everything was moving in slow motion'.""


16Dr Nielssen reviewed the psychiatric history of the accused, which was extensive since the age of nineteen. At the time of the attack, the accused was aged thirty-seven, I think. The family at one stage had moved to Perth and later returned to Sydney. There was an incident of self-injury which Dr Nielssen noted.

""The medical records from Joondalup Campus noted that Mr Elturk was admitted to the psychiatric ward of the hospital on 9/2/10 as an involuntary patient after self-cutting both cubital fossae to 'release the evil spirits'. He was described as having 'limited insight'. The episode of illness was reported to have been triggered by cessation of medication. He is reported to have experienced hallucination of voices and to have believed that his family were 'evil'...""

17Having made a diagnosis of schizo-affective disorder, Dr Nielssen expressed his opinion thus:

""The diagnosis of schizo-affective disorder, or a relapsing psychotic illness with features of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is made on the basis of the history of symptoms of schizophrenia-like psychosis, as well as periods of both elevated and depressed mood when free of symptoms of psychosis...


The contemporaneous documents, including the various witness statements, and Mr Elturk's answers in the ERISP, confirm that he was acutely mentally ill at the time of the offence, and that he committed the offence in response to symptoms of mental illness rather than for any rational or malicious reason. Hence I believe he would have the defence of mental illness open to him.""


Significantly, however, Dr Nielssen was also of opinion:

""In my experience, a special verdict is beneficial to both the accused and the community, because the rehabilitation through the forensic hospital system is so successful, and the rate of re-offending of forensic patients granted conditional or unconditional release is very low.


Mr Elturk has an illness that responds to treatment, does not have a pattern of antisocial conduct or a drug abuse disorder, and he would be expected to progress to a lower security hospital with leave and privileges reasonably soon.


However, Mr Elturk was assessed to be able to understand legal advice and to be fit to plead to the charge...""

18Finally, in respect of the father's statement that was relied upon by Dr Nielssen, both as to the history it gives and as to the accused's demeanour at the time of the stabbing incident, immediately after the serrated edge knife was drawn across his neck, the father stood up and said to his son words set out in the recitation of facts earlier referred to.

""When I was talking to John, his face was plain, like he was in a trance. There was no emotion on his face, no expression, his eyes looked vacant, he didn't even blink.""

19The only slice of evidence that could indicate any real knowledge of what he was doing and a capacity to reason with appropriate foresight was a threat, ""I am going to kill you one day, you son of a bitch"", made about four weeks prior to the knife incident, the subject of the plea.

20None of the evidence that I have referred to, over and above the facts, is contested by the offender.

21The evidence appears both overwhelming and uncontested that the offender attacked his father in the course of a severe psychotic episode, where a McNaghten defence was available to him. Simply put, it is inconceivable that a tribunal of fact in the District Court, however constituted, would find other than this accused not guilty by reason of mental illness.

22The question for this Court is whether any jurisdiction to refuse to accept the plea of guilty exists when an accused does not seek to traverse his plea, and if so, whether the Crown's application should be accepted.

23The prosecution relies upon a capacity of the Crown to raise a defence of not guilty by reason of mental illness in a trial where the defence decline or refuse to reason (see Damic v R [1982] 2 NSWLR 750 and R v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30).

24The Crown argued the same situation applies where there is a plea of guilty. The thrust of his argument was that to permit the plea to advance to a hearing and conviction and imposition of sentence was, as I understand it, a miscarriage of justice. The Crown case is there is an implied power in this Court to take such steps as are necessary to ensure justice is properly administered.

25The defence case ultimately became one of arguing that the power to vacate the plea is dependent upon the threshold issue of an accused's application to traverse his plea. Absent such an application, there is no room for the Court to vacate a plea of its own volition, or upon the urging of the prosecution.

26In the course of considering this matter, I have been attracted to what at first blush appears to be the underlying principles that ought to apply, whether the plea has been traversed or not. They are set out in Wong's case (see Ming Yuk Wong v DPP NSWSC 129).

27In that case, Howie J collected many of the authorities. Significantly, for my purposes, are the following.





The plea was not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt (R v Murphy) [1965] VR 187 at 191.



Where there was a mistake or other circumstance affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt (R v Sagiv (1986) 22 ACrimR 73, leading.



The plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt (Maxwell v R (1995) 184 CLR 501).

28From all of the points distilled by his Honour, including the three I have referred to, his Honour drew this proposition:

""[16] The authorities referred to in the above passage show that the issue is one of the integrity of the plea of guilty and the question to be determined is whether a miscarriage of justice would arise if the Court acted upon the plea of guilty to convict and sentence the defendant...""

29Of course, in all of the cases his Honour looked at, with the exception perhaps of Maxwell, the rationale for changing the plea was to seek a total acquittal. In this case, as the accused readily concedes, his option is not to seek an acquittal, but rather, the special verdict, with all its ""forensic"" consequences (see R v Anderson [1981] VR 155).

30Exercising my mind are those ""forensic consequences"". On the one hand, the accused sees them as ""six or seven years in the forensic system""; on the other hand, Dr Nielssen sees it thus:

""In my experience, a special verdict is beneficial to both the accused and the community, because the rehabilitation through the forensic hospital system is so successful, and the rate of re-offending of forensic patients granted conditional or unconditional release is very low.


Mr Elturk has an illness that responds to treatment, does not have a pattern of antisocial conduct or a drug abuse disorder, and he would be expected to progress to a lower security hospital with leave and privileges reasonably soon.""

31To vacate the plea of guilty and enter one of not guilty, in the light of the evidence I have seen, would virtually guarantee the accused the benefits as Dr Nielssen has described, and that the penal system cannot offer.

32I have contemplated whether the plea entered by the accused is an informed plea. If so, it is informed by his desire to avoid six or seven years in the forensic system, in circumstances where the evidence establishes he has limited insight into the nature of his mental illness, and limited ability to recognise his symptoms when they emerge.

33There is a third concern. I have assumed he has been advised by his legal advisers that the offence he pleaded to is serious, and will, on a plea of guilty, still result in his incarceration for a substantial period. While I have not determined the appropriate sentence, I am concerned his decision based on avoiding six or seven years in the forensic system ignores the seriousness of his offending, the maximum sentence available and the sentencing range that is likely to apply.

34The offender is represented by counsel. I am informed, and accept, that he has been advised of the defence open to him. During the application before me, his counsel has fought hard to be permitted to advance the plea to a conviction. During argument, the accused has sought to reinforce his instructions to counsel on two or three occasions.

35This application by the Crown has had the effect of highlighting for the accused the ramifications of his decision. I must accept Dr Nielssen's opinion that he is fit to plead and all that implies.

36The case law does make it clear that a court has power to reject a plea of guilty if the plea constitutes an abuse of process or if it is in the interests of justice so to do (R v Maxwell). Even the minority in that case, (Dawson and McHugh) approved an earlier NSWCCA decision that, in an appropriate case, the Court may need to give effect to its own right to address an abuse of its process. However, the minority went on to say:

""The need for a court to exercise its inherent power to protect its own process should, in this context, rarely, if ever, be used.""

37While I am satisfied I have the power to reject the plea, the troubling issue is whether I should exercise it in this case.

38The resolution of that depends upon whether the guilty plea represents an abuse of process. The resolution of the abuse of process issue depends upon whether, in the circumstances of this case, the offender is accepting full criminal responsibility for his acts on 3 January 2011, amounts to, or would cause a miscarriage of justice.

39Let there be no doubt, I disagree profoundly with the accused's decision to enter a plea of guilty and his apparent reason for so doing.

40I have, nonetheless, come to a view that the plea is entered on the basis that it is to be accepted as a true admission of guilt. That is not the same question as, is he truly guilty.

41Being satisfied that the plea is so entered, that the accused is fit to plead, and that he has received appropriate advice from an experienced barrister, I have determined to allow the plea to stand.

42I am fortified in that decision by the remarks in Meissner v R (1994-5) 184 CLR 132. In a joint judgment of Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ, their Honours said:

""A person charged with an offence is at liberty to plead guilty or not guilty to the charge, whether or not that person is in truth guilty or not guilty. A court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in exercise of a free choice, in the interests of the person entering the plea. There is no miscarriage of justice if a court does act on such a plea, even if the person entering it is not in truth guilty of the offence.""

I note that the interests of the person in entering the plea were expressed by him as not spending six or seven years in forensic.

43In the same case, Dawson J observed:

""It is true that a person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt. He may do so for all manner of reasons, for example, to avoid worry, inconvenience or expense, to avoid publicity, to protect his family or friends, or in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a plea of not guilty. The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all of the elements of the offence, and a conviction entered upon the basis of such plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.""

44While it is true that the plea may be entered to avoid worry, inconvenience, expense or publicity, or to protect family or friends, or for the reason given in this Court, the fact that those reasons may be found to be unsound at the end of the day does not avoid the effect of the plea. The Court must still act upon it. Nor, it would seem to me, would it give to an offender any basis for complaining at a later point in time about a plea so entered.

45The application of the prosecution is rejected.

46It is clear I cannot proceed with this plea today, and in one sense, I am not inclined to, because I want to give to the Crown an opportunity to consider its position, because it is not a decision I have come to easily, to see whether, in the light of further reflection, the Crown wants to pursue this matter further.

47The accused is not going to be disadvantaged by that, other than the appeal, because ""he ain't going anywhere soon"".

48I will set the matter down in the meantime as though it is to be advanced, and if anything further happens, no doubt the Crown will notify you, Mr Brassil, and me.

DISCUSSION AS TO SUITABLE DATE

49HIS HONOUR: I will issue a warrant for the Sydney - where is the offender being held?

BRASSIL: At Long Bay at the moment, your Honour, in the prison hospital.

HIS HONOUR: For the Sydney District Court. I will make enquiries, or my associate will make enquiries with whether we can get a court in Sydney, and we will let you know.

BRASSIL: Your Honour, might my solicitor have liberty to forward to the Probation and Parole Officer who prepared the report that was tendered on the voir dire, to forward the second draft of Dr Nielssen's psychiatric report. The officer who prepared the pre-sentence report comments that he would be assisted in considering the matter by viewing the psychiatrist's report, and if your Honour ordered that an updated report be prepared--

HIS HONOUR: I will order an updated report and I will require that the defence make available to the relevant Probation and Parole Officer a copy of the report prepared by Dr Nielssen. And you say it's the second one, the revised report.

BRASSIL: Yes your Honour.

		03 April 2013",2012-06-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2759402,RITTER v REGINA [2012] NSWCCA 121,"Judgment

1HOEBEN JA: I agree with RS Hulme J and the orders which he proposes.

2RS HULME J: On 24 May 2011, the abovenamed Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by Sides DCJ in respect of two offences of supplying heroin on three or more separate occasions during a period of 30 consecutive days. One charge related to the period between 1 and 30 March 2010. The second related to the period between 1 and 30 April 2010. The amount of heroin supplied during each of the periods was particularised as 80 grams.

3The offences alleged fell within s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a fine of 3,500 penalty units.

4Taken into account in connection with what I shall refer to as the first offence was a further offence of the deemed supply of 22.1 grams of heroin found after the Applicant's arrest during the execution of a search warrant at his home. The 22.1 grams included 14 grams in a plastic bag, 3.5 grams in one piece of plastic and 21 further pieces of plastic each containing between 0.2 and 0.5 grams.

5The sentences imposed were:-

Offence 1: Imprisonment for 6½ years including a non-parole period of 3 years, both such periods commencing on 6 May 2013.

Offence 2: Imprisonment for 6 years including a non-parole period of 4 years, both such periods commencing on 6 May 2010.

6The effective sentence thus imposed was one of 9½ years imprisonment including a non-parole period of 6 years.

7The evidence established that the Applicant, in his Honour's words, was ""conducting a thriving drug trafficking business selling to users"" albeit he was ""in terms of the drug trafficking hierarchy ... in the lower echelons"". The business was conducted from his residence, his motor vehicle and for a short period from an hotel. In connection with his activities, he used a number of phone numbers, changed from time to time and registered in fictitious names. Individual transactions commonly involved deals of 0.5 of a gram for each of which the Applicant received something of the order of $150 to $180. It may thus be inferred that each charge encompassed well over 80 instances of supply and receipt by the Applicant of something over $12,000 and approaching $24,000 per month for each of the two months covered by the charges.

8In a two hour period shortly after the Applicant's arrest, police counted in excess of 60 missed calls to two of the phones found in the Applicant's car. (In his Honour's remarks on sentence he refers to the number of these calls as 16, but this is obviously a typographical error for the 60 referred to in the Statement of Agreed Facts upon which the sentencing proceedings were conducted.) In the period 19 March to 14 April, police intercepted over 2,900 calls on the phone number then being used by the Applicant, the majority of which related to the Applicant's supply of heroin.

9The Applicant was 39 at the time of the offences. He was born in Romania, coming to Australia when he was 12 in about 1982. He has returned to Romania on a number of occasions since.

10Sides DCJ recorded that the Applicant had had a dysfunctional upbringing because of his father's alcoholism and physical abuse of family members, that the Applicant's first wife died in 1997 and a second marriage, which occurred in 1999, had broken down. His Honour also noted that, according to a report from a psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro, the Applicant had an adjustment disorder and exhibits symptoms of depression and anxiety. His Honour recorded that the Applicant's level of depression had been increased in consequence of being placed on protection a fact which, while it increased the time that the Applicant spends in his cell, would seem not to have limited his visits or access to education or rehabilitation programmes. The Applicant has a criminal history consisting of relatively minor offences and traffic matters, the last of which was in 1995.

11His Honour remarked that the Applicant seemed to have started abusing Panadeine drugs in 2009, then graduated to heroin and ""it is probable that he started abusing these substances to deal with psychological problems he had because of various traumas in his life"". His Honour concluded that it was probable that the Applicant had become involved in offending because of his own addiction to heroin.

12The Applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and was given a discount of the order of 25% for this, a figure which his Honour said would be increased because the Applicant was remorseful. His Honour found that the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were good.

13His Honour also observed:-

In the Court's view, each offence calls for a sentence of imprisonment. There is no basis to distinguish a criminality as between the two offences. (The first charge) carries with it the matter on a Form 1 schedule, that has been taken into account to some extent in assessing the criminality in both offences in terms of assessing the nature of the business that was being conducted and which is reflected in those two offences. Because it has been reflected in assessing the criminality, the length of the sentence in connection with (the first charge) is moderate.

In the Court's view, totality requires a substantial degree of accumulation to reflect the totality of criminality. Because of the accumulation and his need for an extended period of time on parole, the Court found special circumstances.

14His Honour did not otherwise explain why he imposed a lesser non-parole period in the case of what I have referred to as the first offence and for which, presumably on account of the Form 1 offences, he imposed the longer total sentence. However, although the matter is not expressed as clearly as it might be, I take his Honour's decision to impose only a 3 year non-parole period on the first offence as designed to ensure that in assessing the Applicant's criminality, his overall operation was not counted twice. Such an approach was of course perfectly proper.

15One matter to which I have not so far adverted is the fact that the Applicant was extensively assisted in some of his offending by a co-offender, Jorgelina Capra, with whom he had established a de facto relationship in mid-March. His Honour recorded that:-

At times, she held the drug and the money relating to the business. Her voice was heard on the intercepted telephone conversations arranging the supply of heroin with customers. During these conversations she displayed in considerable detail in relation to quantity, preparation, costs and use of heroin (sic) and that she had provided 'active assistance' and that both would deliver heroin on a regular basis.

16His Honour came to sentence Ms Capra approximately a month after he had sentenced the Applicant. She faced only one charge, of supplying heroin on an ongoing basis between 19 March 2010 and 11 April 2010. There was taken into account one charge on a Form 1, viz, possession of some 30 ml of methadone. The sentence imposed on Ms Capra was of imprisonment for 30 months including a non-parole period of 15 months, both such periods commencing on 6 May 2010.

17His Honour recorded that Ms Capra had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, but she had also indicated a preparedness to assist the police. That preparedness was not conveyed to the police in a timely fashion through no fault of Ms Capra and his Honour allowed a discount for the guilty plea and assistance of about 37.5%.

18There were also, according to remarks made by his Honour when sentencing Ms Capra, other reasons for distinguishing the two. In those remarks, his Honour said:-

She assisted her partner in a significant drug supply business but it is important to understand that she did not instigate that business. It was already operating when she commenced her relationship with him. He was obviously the organiser of the business. He was the one making the purchases of the drugs, cutting the drugs and packing them for resupply. He was the one purchasing the mobile phones and registering them in fictitious names.

During the period covered by the charge, she was assisting him to supply up to twenty grams a week to an established customer base. There is no evidence that she had any involvement in establishing that customer base. They were operating as street dealers rather than wholesalers. Her involvement was limited to assisting in taking orders, making arrangements for their delivery and assisting when she was in the car with the co-offender in delivering the drugs. But for her relationship with the co-offender, in the context of drug abuse, she would not have become involved in the offence.

The Court is satisfied that he would have continued with his drug dealing activities regardless of whether she was assisting him or not. However, she did continue to some extent to be involved in his activities in connection with supplying drugs after the end of the period covered by the charge and cannot therefore claim that her activities are isolated to the discrete period covered by the charge.

The offence, in the Court's view, is a serious offence but her criminality bearing in mind her role in the matter, is towards the lower end of the range.

...

So far as the evidence discloses, the relevant differences between the co-offender and this Offender are as follows:-

· this Offender has only one count which covers a different period than the two counts to which the co-offender pleaded guilty. The evidence disclose (sic) that the co-offender was involved in supply well before 1 March 2010. The offence on the Form 1 Schedule covered 22.9 grams of heroin found in his house and which was reflected by an offence of possession for the purposes of supply on the Form 1 Schedule;

· it would be obvious from the Court's recitation of the facts that the co-offender's role in the offence was greater in the sense that he was the instigator, was involved in purchasing and cutting the drugs and otherwise running the business via purchase of phones to assist in running the business. This Offender played a subsidiary or secondary role to assist him. The Court is satisfied that he would have continued his illicit activities regardless of whether or not this Offender assisted him in any way. Therefore in relation to each of the two counts, his criminality was substantially greater than this Offender's criminality;

· the Court notes that the co-offender was on protection; and 

· the co-offender made no admissions and did not receive a discount for assistance to the authorities. 

19The grounds of appeal are:-

1. The sentence imposed in relation to (Offence 1) is manifestly excessive.

2. The sentence imposed in relation to (Offence 2) is manifestly excessive.

3. His Honour erred by finding that the principle of totality required 3 years' accumulation to reflect the totality of the applicant's criminality.

4. The total effective sentence is manifestly excessive.

5. The applicant has been left with a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the sentence that was imposed upon his co-offender, Jorgelina Capra.

20Against the possibility that this Court should conclude that re-sentencing of the Applicant was required, an affidavit of his solicitor was read. The effect of it was that since Mr Ritter was transferred to the Dawn De Loas Correctional Centre at Silverwater he has been assaulted on a number of occasions and in consequence has been placed in a maximum security wing and not able to participate in further educational courses. He has completed the only four which are available to him. He intends to apply for transfer to another centre where educational courses may be available.

Grounds 1 and 2

21The bases advanced under these grounds for criticising the sentences imposed were, firstly, the Judicial Commission statistics and, secondly, a reference to sentences imposed in some eight cases with which this Court has been concerned. It was said that the statistics showed that, of a total of 242 offenders convicted of supplying heroin on an ongoing basis, only two received head sentences in excess of 6 years for individual offences and that the cases demonstrated that something more than simply being a s 25A offender, e.g. a bad record or being manager or head of a syndicate, was required to justify a sentence of 6 years or more. The cases referred to were Ali Osman v R [2008] NSWCCA 157; R v Ladocki [2004] NSWCCA 336; Le Huynh v R [2006] NSWCCA 77; Hanza v R [2008] NSWCCA 288; R v Preston [2005] NSWCCA 177; R v Radford [2002] NSWCCA 122; R v Farah [2005] NSWCCA 67; R v Siljanovski & Kostadinovic [2003] NSWCCA 38.

22Noticeably absent from the argument of counsel for the Applicant was any, I repeat any, attempt to suggest that by reference to the maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment provided for by Parliament and the basic purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 or in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 the sentences were excessive.

23The cases are legion where this Court has stressed the limitations which arguments based on the sentencing statistics impose - see e.g. R v Lao [2003] NSWCCA 315 at [32]; R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 169; (2010) 209 A Crim R 218 at [70]; Windle v R [2011] NSWCCA 277 at [62]-[65]. 

24Similar criticisms may be made when an attempt is made to argue from what happened in one or a limited number of cases, what should happen in an instant case under consideration. Rarely is there an incentive in counsel arguing for a particular result to search for a fair or representative sample and rarely is such a sample produced. It was not in this case. Indeed, when regard is had to the cases referred to in a schedule to these reasons, only two of which were referred to, it is fair to say that the sample to which the Court was referred is positively misleading. 

25The issue where the ground of appeal is that a sentence is manifestly excessive is whether it is unreasonable or plainly unjust - Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25] - whether it is outside the appropriate range of sentences open in the exercise of a sentencing discretion as to demonstrate error. It is not enough simply to show that the sentencing judge could have taken a different course or that the appellate judges would have done so - House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505.

26The second of the sentences under appeal, a sentence uncomplicated by a Form 1, was of 6 years including a non-parole period of 4 years and arrived at after a discount of 25% for the applicant's plea and an unquantified amount for remorse. The sentence corresponds to a notional starting point of something over 8 years. The quantity supplied was specified as 80 grams and, as I have said, indicates well over 80 instances of supply and receipt of proceeds of over $12,000 and approaching $24,000. The Applicant had a thriving retail business and the evidence of phone calls suggests far more instances of supply in the periods covered by the charges. Comparison with the cases referred to in the Schedule inspires the following remarks.

(i) The deduced starting point for Hoete of 5 years is significantly less than in the case of the Applicant but was regarded as lenient and Hoete was only a runner;

(ii) The deduced starting point for the sentence imposed in respect of SZ's second offence of 7½ years is only slightly below that under consideration here. SZ was supplying in individual quantities similar to those supplied by the Applicant but the offence charged involved far fewer instances of supply. On the other hand he had been on bail and had a significant criminal record.

(iii) This Court's decision in Smith v R [2007] to adopt a starting point of 6 years considered in isolation tends to support the Applicant's contention here as does the fact that Smith had been on conditional liberty. However the quantity supplied by Smith that was the subject of the charge, regarded by the Court as relevant, was less than half of that here and the number of instances of supply, about 12, vastly less. 

(iv) The starting point in Mirza v R may be deduced to have been 10 years. He was a commercial rather than a retail supplier. However, the quantity supplied was only a little higher than the 80 grams charged against the Applicant and the Court's remarks about there having been only three instances of supply argues strongly against the decision being of any comfort to the Applicant.

(v) The starting point in Chen v R may be deduced to have been 8 years and 4 months. The fact that Chen's role was higher up the usual chain of drug suppliers than the Applicant argues in the Applicant's favour although in light of the fact that the quantities were comparable and the Applicant supplied on far more occasions effectively nullifies the weight to be given to that argument. I would not infer that the Court, inconsistently with the principles of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 allowed the other offences to influence its approach to the proper sentence for the on-going supply offence. 

(vi) In Fong v R, the quantity suppled and the number of occasions of supply were vastly less than in the case of the Applicant's offending although no doubt the offender's activities included other occasions of supply. The moneys shown to have been received were also appreciably less. The notional starting point of 7 years for Fong's sentence - which the Court did not suggest was at the extreme of the available range - is not greatly less than the 8 years that is to be deduced from the Applicant's sentence

(vii) Given that Sides DCJ in Eap took into account in arriving at the sentence he imposed - which corresponded to a notional starting point of 8 years - the offence of the deemed supply of 201.9 grams of heroin, the sentence imposed by his Honour provides some support for the Applicant here. The fact that Eap was higher up the drug dealing scale and had offences on a Form 1 taken into account argue in the same direction. However, the quantity, the number of instances of supply which were vastly less than in the case of the Applicant here, and the money involved in the dealing that was the subject of the on-going supply charge argue in the opposite direction.

(viii) Ellis DCJ's decisions in King and Smith (where the sentences correspond to starting points of 8 and 9 years respectively) operate to deny the validity of the Applicant's argument. 

27In totality, the cases referred to in the schedule demonstrate that the Appellant's proposition that something more than simply being a s 25A offender, e.g. a bad record or being manager or head of a syndicate, was required to justify a sentence of 6 years or more is wrong and, insofar as the individual sentences imposed on the Applicant are to be judged by sentences imposed in other cases those sentences were not manifestly excessive. 

28The seriousness of offending against which s 25A is directed has been the subject of remark in numerous cases - see for example R v Khaled [2001] NSWCCA 169; R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247; R v CBK [2002] NSWCCA 457; (2002) 128 A Crim R 29 and in R v Cheikh & Hoete [2004] NSWCCA 448. It is sufficient to quote from one of these. In R v Khalad [2001] NSWCCA 169, Wood CJ at CL remarked:-

18 It is precisely to the dealers who engage in this kind of conduct, that s 25A is directed, since it is those persons who keep the pernicious trade in heroin rolling. It may well be that an important part of the policy behind this legislation was to impose significant penalties which exist for those offenders who see it as profitable or prudent to immunise themselves from the significant penalties which exist for dealing in single large quantities, and in particular, by selling small enough deals from a stock warehoused elsewhere. I am unable, however, to accept that the section is to be confined to them. It applies equally to dealers such as the present applicant, who engage in an ongoing trade within the meaning of the section.

19 An appropriate differentiation can be drawn between the various classes of offenders to whom the section applies, by reflecting that in sentences towards the upper end of range within the available maximum of twenty years, for the bigger and more organised dealers, and by imposing lesser sentences for those who are at the bottom of the distribution chain. What is important is to give full effect to the legislative policy that this section operate so as to provide strong deterrent to those who may be tempted to engage in an ongoing trade in heroin and, in particular, to deter those who are minded to stand in their shoes once they are apprehended and sentenced to imprisonment. This is necessary to combat the unfortunate reality that there seems to have been an almost endless supply of street sellers willing to move in once others of their ilk are taken off the streets.

29In this connection it may not be inappropriate to refer again to the survey of imprisoned burglars reported in ""The Stolen Goods Market in New South Wales"" conducted by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research in 1998 and which indicated a median expenditure by heroin users of $1,500 per week and the need to steal goods worth a number of times this amount to feed their habit. On average each such offender is thus costing the community through property losses and the like $200,000 per year. If conduct such as that engaged in by the Applicant does not encourage such offending, it at least takes advantage of it. In each of the periods which were the subject of charges against the Applicant, he offended against s 25A in a premeditated, organised, and major way. In the circumstances, the individual sentences imposed for his offences were not manifestly excessive.

Grounds 3 and 4

30The formulation of the third ground appeal is somewhat misleading. Given that the sentence on the second count was expressed to be the first to operate, the degree of accumulation was 2 years. However, the gravamen of the Applicant's complaint is that sentences with non-parole periods totalling 7 years were so structured that the Applicant has an effective non-parole period of 6 years and a total sentence of 9½ years. Given the sorts of considerations to which I have referred in [28] et seq, I do not regard that sentence as in any way manifestly excessive for someone who chooses, as is demonstrated by the number of phone calls that the Applicant received, to become a major drug supplier. 

31In formulating the terms of s 25A as it has, the legislature has defined the offence by reference to a defined and confined period of 30 days. Repetition of offending outside that period forms no part of the criminality involved in the offence as defined. If repeated with the frequency envisaged by the section that further offending constitutes a different offence and, depending on circumstances, including frequency and quantity of drug, may well amount to a doubling of an offender's criminality.

32The Applicant chose by his conduct to commit two offences. Given the nature of his activities, the benefits he received and the damage he did to the community by his actions may be inferred to have, approximately doubled. Certainly, considerations of totality argue against a simple doubling of the penalty but, taking the sentence on the second charge (uncomplicated as it is by the Form 1 offences) as the starting point, the accumulation involved in what his Honour did was to increase the total term from 6 years to 9½ years and the non-parole period from 4 years to 6½ years. Looked at another way, there was a reduction of the total term from 12½ years to 9½ years. In my view, these figures demonstrate that the accumulation which his Honour ordered was not excessive.

33It must not be forgotten that the seriousness with which Parliament regards offending of the nature of that indulged in by the Applicant is indicated by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment for one offence. A non-parole period corresponding to that period could be expected to be of the order of 15 years. The sentence of 9½ years with a non-parole period of 6 years - for two offences - is appreciably less than this. These grounds also fail. 

Ground 5

34A comparison of the two sentences imposed on the Applicant in light of his Honour's remarks indicates that the 6 months difference between them is accounted for by the Form 1 offence. A sentence of 6 years after allowing a discount of 25% for a plea, reflects a starting point of 8 years, though his Honour's remark that the sentence would be further reduced because of remorse indicates the actual or notional starting point must have been higher than 8 years by some unknown amount.

35The head sentence of imprisonment for 30 months imposed on Ms Capra after a discount of 37½% reflects a pre-discount actual or notional starting point of 48 months or 4 years, half or somewhat less than half apparently adopted in the case of the Applicant. The disparity becomes greater if one considers the non-parole period of 15 months imposed on Ms Capra and the 4 year longest individual non-parole period imposed on the Applicant. Did the difference in their offending justify so great a difference in the sentences?

36My mind has vacillated on this issue but, in the end, I have concluded that his Honour was entitled to take the view that the difference in roles and activities justified the difference in penalties. Traditionally, in the drug field the criminality of organisers has been regarded as substantially more serious than that of minions they employ to carry out more mechanical tasks. The relative positions of the Applicant and Ms Capra might fairly be regarded as echoing this sort of difference.

Conclusion

37In the result, the orders which I would propose are:-

1. Grant leave to appeal.

2. Dismiss the appeal.

38FULLERTON J: I am unable to agree in its entirety with the way RS Hulme J has dealt with grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal although I agree that they should be dismissed. I agree that ground 5 should be dismissed. I respectfully disagree with his Honour's disposition of grounds 3 and 4 of the appeal. I would have allowed the appeal on those grounds and to have moved to resentence. 

Grounds 1 and 2 

39Whilst I agree that the applicant has not made good his contention that the individual sentences imposed on each of the on-going drug supply counts were manifestly excessive, and that for that reason grounds 1 and 2 should be dismissed, I am unable to endorse RS Hulme J's criticisms of counsel's formulation of the argument directed to persuading the Court of that fact. 

40I did not understand Mr Boulten's oral submissions to have been advanced without reference to the maximum penalty provided for by the Parliament for an offence against 25 A being a term of imprisonment of 20 years. His written submissions make specific reference it and, as the Crown acknowledged in her oral submissions, correctly. While Mr Boulten did not refer to the statutory maximum again in oral submissions, I have no doubt that he was at all times conscious that it fixed the upper limit of the trial judge's sentencing discretion. 

41I am also unable to endorse the criticism implicit in his Honour review of the cases in the schedule to his judgment that the sample from which Mr Boulten sought to mount his argument was unrepresentative of the range of sentences imposed either at first instance or after the intervention of this Court, or that his those cases to which he made specific reference had the potential to mislead the Court, much less that it did so. There are well recognised limitations on the utility of referring to sentences imposed in other cases to support an argument that a particular sentence is manifestly excessive. In Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [48] the High Court had occasion to emphasise again that consistency in sentencing is not demonstrated by numerical equivalence and does not require it in order for the objective of reasonable consistency in sentencing to be achieved. 

42They also regarded Simpson J identification in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [303]-[305] of the use to which information about other cases might legitimately be put as accurate. They said:

""303. ... A history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. Such a history does not establish that the range is the correct range, nor that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" 

43But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence""(emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".

44While senior counsel's approach may not have been particularly productive, it was nevertheless open to him to endeavour to exemplify, by reference to other cases, what he contended was a marked inconsistency between the way his client was sentenced and the sentences imposed on other offenders whose offending was said to be comparable and whose subjective circumstances were said not widely different. 

45Having regard to the seriousness of the offending against which s25 A is directed, I would dismiss the first and second grounds of appeal but on that basis that I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed were ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". This is principled test in to be applied where a sentences is said to be manifestly excessive. (see Hoeben JA in R v Windle [2011] NSWCCA 227 at [55] where his Honour noted the statement of principle in R v Vuni [2006] NSWCCA 171 and its endorsement by this Court)

Grounds 3 and 4 

46I am however persuaded that the degree of accumulation of the two sentences, which increased the total term from 6 years to 9 ½ years and the non parole period from 4 years to 6 ½ years, has been productive of a total effective sentence that is manifestly excessive in the relevant sense and, accordingly, that grounds 3 and 4 have been made out.

47Self evidently the sentencing judge was obligated to impose a sentence for two discrete 25A offences. Since the offender's established drug dealing business continued unabated over two consecutive months it was also appropriate that the sentences should be partially accumulated to reflect that fact. However, save for the offence on the Form 1 which was taken into account in the calculation of the sentence on first count, the same objective features defined the operation of the drug business and the offender's role within it on each count. 

48In my view, the total effective sentence has failed to reflect that fact and that application of the principle of totality warranted a more moderated degree of accumulation. I would regard a period of two years accumulation as sufficient to address the totality of offending. 

49I agree with RS Hulme J that ground 5 should be dismissed. 
 
SCHEDULE

50In R v Cheikh & Hoete [2004] NSWCCA 448, Cheikh was regarded as a manager of a substantial commercial operation of methylamphetamine supply which had continued for something in excess of nine months. Hoete was one of the runners employed in that operation. There were four counts preferred against Cheikh, each covering the period of 30 days and five charges, each dealing with another 30 days of supply, were placed on a Form 1. Hoete also faced four counts of ongoing supply. His Form 1 included four similar charges (for other months) and six counts of supplying drugs. In the periods, the subject of the charges, he worked between 8 and 31 shifts. 

51This Court allowed Crown appeals in the case of both offenders who were held entitled to a discount of 15% for their pleas. In the case of Cheikh, the Court held that fixed terms of 4 years imposed on three of the counts were manifestly inadequate and increased each of those terms to 8 years. The effective sentence imposed on Cheikh was one of imprisonment for 15 years including a non-parole period of 11 years. The sentence reflect the constraints then existing in the case of Crown appeals and was regarded as lower than his offending merited. Of course, Cheikh's criminality not only extended for a longer period than did the Applicants but because of the nature of the operation in which he was engaged and his role in it was substantially worse than the Applicant's.

52For three of the counts against him, Hoete had been sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment of 3 years. On the fourth count, after taking into account the offences of the Form 1, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years including a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months. The total effective sentence imposed was 6 years including a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. With the concurrence of Levine J, I remarked that the 3 years sentences imposed on Hoete were lenient and perhaps manifestly so but that a decision on that issue was unnecessary because the manifest inadequacy found in the overall sentence could be dealt with by changing the extent of concurrency that the first instance judge had allowed. The effective overall sentence was increased to one of 8 years including a non-parole period of 5 years, a result that reflected leniency that had been extended to Cheikh and other runners and the constraints in a Crown appeal. 

53Hoete had no prior convictions of significance and the sentencing judge doubted he would re-offend. It is to be inferred from the report that he was not addicted to drugs. Hoete's criminality also went for much longer than did the Applicant's, though this was of at most limited relevance in relation to individual counts. More significantly, he was only a runner and his role thus significantly less. 

54By working back from the sentence imposed for individual counts, one can deduce a starting point of the order of 5 years which, as I have indicated, was regarded as lenient and perhaps manifestly so.

55In SZ v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249, the offender had been sentenced for four offences only two of which, for ongoing supply are presently relevant. The first of these involved five instances of supply totalling 0.9 grams of amphetamine and the second offence involved six instances of supply totalling 3.6 grams. However, the circumstances including the fortified nature of the premises, a dwelling house, and the goods in custody contributed to a finding that the offender was a ""well established and well organised commercial supplier of amphetamines ... on a continuing basis"". In connection with the first offence, there were taken into account 13 charges of goods in custody and three charges of receiving. The value of the property the subject of those offences was some hundreds of thousands of dollars. The offender had been on bail at the time of offending. Other sentences were made concurrent.

56The sentences imposed for two offences of ongoing supply were imprisonment for 4½ years including a non-parole period of 2½ years and 3 years and 9 months including a non-parole period of 2 years. The judge's starting point for these sentences had been, respectively, 12 years and 10 years. 

57This Court held that the starting points were excessive but so was a discount for an early plea and assistance but that when a proper discount of 50% was used no lesser sentences were warranted in law. Thus, for the second offence mentioned, the Court regarded a starting point of 7½ years as acceptable.

58The offender was aged 52 and during the preceding 10 years had acquired a significant criminal record. He was a drug addict but this was not accepted as the sole reason for his offending.

59In Smith v R [2007] NSWCCA 138, sentences imposed included one for ongoing supply and was of imprisonment for 4 years including a non-parole period of 2 years. The basis for the charge were about a dozen supplies of amphetamine totalling about 35 grams. Offences on a Form 1 being four of supplying cannabis, one of supplying amphetamine, one of goods in custody and one of possession of cannabis were taken into account.

60The offender who was on a bond at the time, had a minor criminal record and was entitled to a 50% discount for his plea and assistance. He was assessed as having reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and unlikely to re-offend. The sentencing judge had adopted a starting point of 8 years.

61The Court held that the starting point of 8 years was excessive and should have been 6 years. In arriving at this conclusion, the Court observed that the offender's activities involved repetition, system and organisation but at a level much below that of some other offenders and that the fact that the offender had supplied only 35 grams was a factor of some relevance as was the fact of conditional liberty. The Court was influenced by the fact that, as it said, the statistics showed that between July 1999 and June 2006, there was only one sentence exceeding 6 years for ongoing supply of amphetamine.

62In Mirza v R [2007] NSWCCA 248, this Court dismissed an appeal from a sentence of 6 years including a non-parole period of 3½ years on an offender who had no prior criminal record and a strong subjective case and who had pleaded guilty to one count of on-going supply. The sentence reflected a discount of 40% for the plea and assistance, indicating a starting point of 10 years. The offender had supplied 3 parcels of cocaine to an undercover officer, each for a price of $7,500. One parcel involved 29.8 grams of 49% purity, a second of 28.7 grams of 47% and the third 28.4 grams of a purity of 27%.

63The size of each parcel was regarded as an important factor in judging the seriousness of the offending, Howie J remarking that it would have been obvious to the offender that the undercover officer appeared to be a trafficker who would on-sell. His Honour also made the point that the offender was not a street dealer but that the quantity of drug was an important fact in judging the seriousness of the offending. However, the number of occasions of supply, only 3, was a factor regarded as arguing for the offence being less serious than otherwise.

64In Chen v R [2009] NSWCCA 157, on a charge of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine (ice), the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 4 years. Two offences of supply of a total of 17 grams outside the 30 day period the subject of the ongoing supply charge were taken into account. The offender was a drug addict who had started to use ice to deal with depression. He had no relevant criminal record, was serving and was likely to continue serving his sentence in protective custody and received a discount of 25% for his plea.

65In this Court he was described as ""not a mere 'street dealer'"" and ""part of an organised commercial operation"". It was said that the seriousness of his offending was apparent from the length of his involvement in the enterprise - it was about 6 months although he was under police surveillance for only about 38 days - the number of individual transactions in which he participated, and from the overall quantity of drugs that he suppled - in the 30 days this was 90 grams in the course of 24 occasions. He had a number of alternative supply chains and an established customer base which he dealt with from his residential address. 

66It is possible, though the Court did not say so, that the fact that sentences imposed at the same time on other offences were wholly subsumed within the sentence for ongoing supply may have influenced the Court to dismiss the appeal. 

67In Fong v R [2011] NSWCCA 283 this Court reduced a sentence of imprisonment of 5 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 3 years to one of imprisonment for 5 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months imposed on an offender who pleaded guilty to a charge of on-going supply of heroin. The ground of the Courts' interference was proportionality with a co-offender, the Court saying that the original sentence was not manifestly excessive. The offence was constituted by five occasions of supply.

68The amounts supplied were 0.83 grams, 3.41 grams, 3.28 grams, 3.3 grams and 1.13 grams, a total of just under 12 grams. The purity varied between 65 and 67.5%. The amounts received for the heroin supplied were respectively $750, $2,150, $2,150, $2,150 and $950, a total of $ $8,150. The supplies were incidents in the course of a large scale commercial operation principally conducted by co-offenders and in which the offender had participated in for some 12 months. Taken into account were two offences, one of supplying heroin and one of possessing heroin. The sentencing judge had remarked that these merited a measurable but not significant increase in penalty. 

69The Applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was held entitled to a discount of 25%. He was aged 30, was a heroin addict and committed the offences to fund his addiction. His prospects of rehabilitation were regarded as good, provided he remained abstinent of drugs. 

70In R v Ek Huoy Eap (unreported, Sides DCJ, 4 March 2009) the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years including a non-parole period of 4 years on a charge of on-going supply of heroin and to imprisonment for 5 years including a non-parole period of 40 months for an offence of the deemed supply of 201.9 grams of heroin. Both sentences were ordered to commence on the same day. The foundations of the on-going supply charge were 5 instances of supply to an undercover operative, the amounts being 0.46 grams, 3.3 grams, 6.5 grams, 6.5 grams and 13.4 grams, a total of a little over 20 grams. The purity was commonly about 22.5%. The amounts received were $200, $1,000, $2,000, $2,000 and $4,000, a total of $9,200. His Honour recorded that the offender operated a highly organized syndicate supplying illegal drugs to street dealers to on-sell. 

71Taken into account in the on-going supply charge were 3 offences of supplying heroin, one of conducting drug premises, possession of 9 grams of cannabis and goods in custody. The supply offences were each of about 0.45 gram committed in the month before the period specified for the ongoing supply offence. The other 3 offences arose from matters discovered in a search of the offender's home after her arrest. The goods in custody were an amount of $12,280. On that occasion the police also found 201.9 grams of heroin which was the subject of the second charge. His Honour said that those drugs were part of the business the subject of the on-going supply charge and took them into account in assessing the criminality of the first charge.

72His Honour allowed a discount of approximately 25% for the offender's plea and allowed more for remorse and the fact that the plea meant that the undercover operative's identity did not have to be revealed. The offender was 36 at the time of sentence, had an unhappy childhood, poor self-esteem, a history of depression and self-harm, a gambling problem and was herself addicted to heroin. She had a minor criminal history. His Honour concluded that it was likely that the profits of the enterprise were consumed by the offender's own addiction. Her prospects of rehabilitation were regarded as reasonable.

73In R v King (unreported, Ellis DCJ, 17 September 2009), the offender was sentenced to imprisonment of 6 years including a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months for an offence of the on-going supply of ecstasy. There were four occasions of supply, all to an undercover operative - 20 tablets for $700, on two occasions 525 tablets for $10,000, and 390 tablets for $7,400. Ellis DCJ observed that s 25A was enacted to deal with those who regularly supplied small quantities and the quantities involved in King's offence were significantly higher than will often be the case in offences under the section. His Honour recorded that King's motivation was money, he standing to gain about $2,500.

74Taken into account were five charges on a Form 1, being possession of less than 1 gram of methylamphetamine, possession of 15 grams of cannabis leaf, possession of three ecstasy tablets, cultivation of three cannabis plants and goods in custody in the sum of $200. These items were found on King when he was arrested and his home then searched.

75A discount of the order of 25% was allowed for the offender's plea. He had a criminal record of one instance of assault and two of possess or use illicit substances. He was 28 at the time of offending, had a dysfunctional family background, some gambling issues and a major depressive disorder which Ellis regarded as a mitigating factor. His Honour accepted that the offender was remorseful and had prospects of rehabilitation although his Honour felt unable to say that the offender was unlikely to re-offend.

76In R v Smith (unreported, Ellis DCJ, 18 August 2010) the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years and 9 months including a non-parole period of 4 years for an offence of on-going supply of ecstasy and imprisonment for 5 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 3 years for an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of ecstasy (which was of a similar nature but outside the 30 day period for the first offence). The sentences had the same commencing date. The ongoing supply offence involved three occasions of supply, each of 1000 tablets weighing approximately 223 grams for a price of $10,000. The offender's own return for participating in each of the transactions was $400. The Crown conceded that there was no evidence that the offender had participated in other occasions of supply. Two offences were taken into account on a Form 1.

77A discount of 25% was allowed for the offender's plea, Judge Ellis noting that his starting point was 9 years. The offender had no prior record and was regarded as unlikely to re-offend. He had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and/or post traumatic stress disorder.

2759414,Singh v R [2012] NSWSC 637,"Sentence
1The offender, Chamanjot Singh, was charged with the murder of his wife, Manpreet Kaur, on 29 December 2009. He pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter, on the grounds of provocation. The Crown did not accept that plea and the matter proceeded to a trial with a jury. The jury acquitted the offender of murder but convicted him of manslaughter. 
2The only issue at trial was whether the Crown could prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not act under provocation. Having regard to the circumstances of the death of the deceased, there can be no doubt that the offender killed his wife when he had lost self-control. The only significant issue was whether or not an ordinary person, in the position of the offender, would have formed an intention to kill in the circumstances. The jury was not satisfied that an ordinary person would not respond in the manner alleged. 
3The offender gave evidence during his trial. Significant portions of his evidence were not challenged. In many instances, only he and his wife were present. However, his evidence was convincing and I generally accept that the events he relates occurred.
4The offender and the deceased were married in India on 14 September 2008. The offender was 20 years old and the deceased was 27 years old. They had met and formed a relationship while undertaking an English language course. During the course a suggestion was made to them by one of their teachers that they should marry. The marriage would enable one of the couple to enter Australia on a study visa and the other to enter on a dependent spouse visa. The offender and the deceased married shortly after. The decision was made that the deceased would apply to come to Australia on the study visa and the offender would come on the dependent spouse visa to enable him to work to support her financially. 
5On 30 January 2009 the deceased moved to Australia and began to study a Diploma in Business Management at Southern Cross University. The offender came to Australia approximately three and a half months later on 12 May 2009. As planned, the offender entered Australia on a spousal visa. 
6The offender's relationship with his wife deteriorated from the time of his arrival in Australia. The offender and the deceased began to argue about financial issues only hours he arrived. The offender was accused by his wife of failing to bring the amount of money from India that the deceased had expected him to bring to Australia. On the offender's account, the deceased became upset upon learning that he had only brought $1700 instead of the $2000 that she had requested that he bring. The deceased demanded that the offender call his family in India and arrange for them to send an additional $300 dollars. The offender said that he had obtained the $1700 from his parents and relatives in India who had pooled their life savings in order to enable the offender to travel to Australia. The offender gave evidence that the deceased continued to pressure him to obtain extra money, despite knowing that his family did not have the means to provide him with the funds.
7After his arrival in Sydney the offender obtained employment as a cleaner at Rebel Sport. The couple continued to argue about financial issues. The deceased wished to send money which had been earned by the offender back to her family in India and the applicant felt that they could not afford to send back the amount she requested. The deceased also became upset with the offender when she learned that the offender had spent any part of his income on personal items, rather than saving the funds to send to her family in India.
8The offender gave evidence that the father of the deceased contacted him over the phone after an argument with the deceased. He said that his father-in-law had said ""Fuck, who are you to say anything bad to my daughter? We will kick you out from the [country]."" When the offender responded by saying that he did not start the fight with the deceased, his father-in-law said ""I will kill you if you say anything bad to my daughter. I know some boys in Sydney, I will send to your house and they will teach you a lesson."" When the offender again said that he had not said anything to the deceased's his father-in-law said ""Listen, this is a warning to you, if you say this again ... it will be your end.""
9Pressure was also placed on the relationship by the offender's suspicion that the deceased was cheating on him. The offender's suspicion first arose whilst the couple was still in India. The offender believed that the deceased had lied to him about the identity of a person know as Preet. The offender was aware that the deceased had received phone calls from Preet but she told the offender that Preet was a female friend who lived in India. When the offender questioned the deceased about the identity of Preet on a later occasion she admitted that Preet was a male friend who was residing in Australia. 
10Shortly after discovering that Preet was a male friend of the deceased the offender found approximately seven or eight text messages from Preet on the phone of the deceased. The messages indicated that Preet was waiting for the deceased in Australia and wished to commence a relationship with her when she arrived. The offender confronted the deceased. An argument ensued but the couple reconciled after the deceased told the offender that the she would discontinue contact with Preet. 
11When the offender arrived in Australia he once again became suspicious that the deceased was being unfaithful. On an occasion when the deceased returned home from class later than expected, the offender questioned her about her whereabouts. The deceased responded to the questioning by threatening the offender that she would kick him out of the house and out of the country if he continued to question her in such a manner. The threat had particular force due to the fact that the offender's immigration status was dependent upon his status as the deceased's husband. 
12The offender gave evidence that the couple's sexual relationship deteriorated in response to the matrimonial disharmony. There was also evidence that the tension between the couple resulted in a number of episodes of domestic violence. In August of 2009 the deceased met with her sister, Jaspreet Kaur, in the central business district of Sydney. Jaspreet could see that the deceased had bruising to her left arm and an injury to her face that appeared to be caused by deep scratches. The deceased told her sister that the injuries were caused by the offender who had hit her because he was jealous about phone calls that she had received. 
13Sarbjeet Singh, the brother in law of the deceased, gave evidence that two or three months prior to the death of the deceased she had arrived at his house in a distressed state. The deceased had marks on her face and neck. The deceased indicated that the marks were a result of a physical argument with the deceased. 
14Manmohan Singh, a former roommate of the offender and the deceased, gave evidence that he had asked the couple to move out following an argument in which the offender had hit the deceased in the back of the head. He recalled seeing marks on her face and a lump on the back of her head. The offender told Singh that the deceased had been lying to him and had bitten him. The offender showed Singh a bite mark to support his story. 
15At the time of the killing, the offender resided with the deceased in a divided house at Westmead. The property was owned by Thambiappah Satchithananthan, who resided with his wife in the front section of the house. The rear section of the house had three bedrooms. One was occupied by Sukh Singh, another by Jatinder Singh and his wife Herleena Kaur and the third by the offender and the deceased. The rear section also contained a shared lounge room, kitchen and bathroom. In addition to the divided house, there was also another house located on the front of the block. The house was unoccupied at the time the deceased was killed. 
16On 28 December 2009 the offender and the deceased departed for their separate places of employment. The deceased worked at a Subway store in the Sydney CBD. The offender finished work at 11 am and, at the request of the deceased, went to the deceased's workplace to pick her up at 2.15 pm. The offender waited for the deceased outside her work place for two to three hours. During this time the deceased came out of the premises to tell him that she had to continue working. At 5 pm the deceased told the offender to go home without her as she could not leave with him. 
17The deceased returned home at approximately 9:30 pm. The offender questioned the deceased about her whereabouts. The deceased said that she had already told him that she was at work. She also said that if the offender continued to question her she would kick him out of the house and out of the country. 
18The offender gave evidence that the argument left him extremely upset and concerned about his situation if the deceased followed through with her threats. On the following day, Tuesday 29 December 2009, the offender withdrew $1500 from a joint bank account that he had opened with the deceased. The withdrawal of the funds was motivated by a fear that he would have nowhere to live and no money if the deceased left him. 
19The deceased arrived home from work at approximately 9.30 that evening after finishing work at 8 pm. The offender had been home since 5 pm. As soon as the deceased arrived home she confronted the offender about the withdrawal of the funds from the joint bank account. A heated argument ensued. 
20Following the argument, the deceased went to speak with Herleena Kaur, another occupant of the house in Herleena's bedroom. The deceased was distressed and crying. She told Herleena that she did not like Beenu (a nickname for the offender), that he always fought with her and that she would be moving in with her sister the following day. 
21The deceased rang her sister Jaspreet from Herleena's bedroom and told her that she was coming to live with her the following day. She also told her sister that she no longer wanted to live with the offender, that they had fought the previous day and that he always called his mother and told her about the fighting. 
22At 10.02 pm the offender rang Rajan Sadeora, a family friend from India, and told her that the deceased was abusing him. Ms Sadeora was unable to speak with the offender at that time and told him that she would ring back shortly. Approximately 5 minutes later, Ms Sadeora called back and spoke with the offender. He told Ms Sadeora that the deceased was abusing him and his mother. Ms Sadeora asked to speak with the deceased but was told by the offender that the deceased was with her friend in another room and did not wish to talk. Ms Sadeora then told the offender to settle the dispute lovingly, and that every husband and wife have disagreements.
23The offender then went to bed. The deceased came into the room some time afterwards. A short time later, after 10 pm, the deceased was heard screaming in the Punjabi language ""Save me, save me"" and ""I won't do it again"". She was also heard to call out ""sorry, sorry"" and exclaim ""ahh"". Herleena Kaur and her husband Jatinder Singh went to the door of the bedroom. Jatinder knocked and tried to open the door, but it was locked from the inside. Jatinder called out for the door to be opened. The offender yelled to wait, and said that he would let him in. The owner of the house, Mr Satchinthananthan, came to the door about this time. A short time later, the offender opened the door and stepped forward towards him. He pushed Jatinder back, ran past him and out the front door. 
24The deceased was lying on her back. Her throat had been cut. There was a pool of blood on the floor and blood stains on the walls, the television stand and clothes in the room. Underneath the body of the deceased was the portion of a box cutter blade. In a washing basket in the room was a bloodied box cutter. $1450 of the $1500 withdrawn by the offender on that day was also found in the room.
25The only account of events inside the room came from the offender. I accept his evidence. The offender said that he was in bed when the deceased entered the room. She then made a phone call to her sister in Delhi. While she was talking to her sister, her sister's husband, Harish Baluja, took the phone and asked to speak to the offender. The offender told the deceased that he did not want to talk to anyone. The deceased then put the phone on loud speaker. Mr Baluja then began to yell at the offender, saying ""Oi sisterfucker, oi motherfucker, why you withdraw money from the account?"" The offender responded by saying ""This is my money, I deposited into the account"". The deceased then shouted into the phone that ""He is taking care about his family. He is taking care about his mother"" and ""he love his mother, he love his father and he is taking more care about his family"". 
26Mr Baluja then told the offender, ""If you want to take care for your mother, have sex with her and have a kid with her and - because it will be good for you"". The offender became very upset and said to Mr Baluja ""Oi sister fucker, who are you to say wrong thing about my mother"". The deceased then slapped the offender and said, ""Who are you talking to my family like that?"" The offender then said, ""He is talking to my mother, like, he abusing to my mother. He's telling me to have sex with her"". The deceased then said ""Yeah. You and your mother is like that"" and started to hit him again. 
27The offender then said to the deceased, ""Manpreet, you don't love me. I love you. I give you my life but you don't love me."" He gave evidence that the deceased then told him that she had never loved him, that she loved only Preet and that she and Preet would make sure that he was kicked out of the country. The offender then became enraged. He gave evidence that held the deceased around the throat while she slapped him. He took hold of a box cutter that was present in the room. He had no recollection of the events that followed.  
28In its submissions on sentence, the Crown accepted that the events in the 48 hours leading up to the death of the deceased were, by and large, not in dispute. It was also accepted that the actions of the offender during that period were relevant to his state of mind at the time of the attack upon his wife and that the attack was to be judged against the long history of marital disharmony and domestic violence that characterised their relationship
29It is plain that on the previous day the offender had formed the view that his marriage was likely to come to an end and that he needed to take some steps to protect himself or otherwise he may be without a place to live and, without any money, he would lose his entitlement to remain in Australia. I accept the offender's evidence that the events of the last 48 hours of deceased's life heightened the offender's concerns about his position. Ultimately, being told that his wife had never loved him and was going to leave him, accompanied by the offensive remarks of the deceased's brother-in-law was the trigger for the offender losing his self control. 
30The acts by which the offender killed his wife were violent. It could only be described as a ferocious attack. The evidence from the autopsy, which I accept, was that he first strangled her (although that may not have been the cause of her death) and then cut her throat at least eight times with a box cutter. At least two of the cuts were deep and would have led to a fatal loss of blood.
31The crime of manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period, which is in part a reflection of the difficulty of sentencing for manslaughter. Those difficulties are significant when the foundation for the verdict is that, although the offender has formed an intention to kill, he or she has done so in response to the provocation of the deceased. 
32It has been said previously that there are three significant matters relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter by provocation. Firstly, the degree of provocation offered or alternatively the extent of loss of control is relevant. Secondly, the time between provocation and the loss of self control which, when short, has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence. Thirdly, the degree of violence or aggression displayed by the offender is relevant and, when excessive, has a tendency of increasing the objective gravity of the offence.
33Although the events which triggered the offender's actions occurred within a short time frame on 29 December, those events were a continuation of the circumstances which occasioned anxiety to the offender the previous day. All of the events of that 48 hour period were imposed upon a background of increasing failure in their relationship over the previous months since the offender had arrived in Australia. The offender ultimately responded by entirely losing his self -control.
34Although I am satisfied that the ultimate acts of provocation were imposed upon a relationship which had been deteriorating over many months, the offender reacted within a relatively short time to the statements made by the deceased and by her brother-in-law, making plain that their relationship was at an end and that the offender's future was, to say the least, bleak. However, when considering the objective seriousness of the offence it is relevant that on the night he killed his wife there was a break in their arguing which may have provided an opportunity for him to reflect on the circumstances. However, as is apparent, he was ultimately overwhelmed by the situation.
35It is apparent that the offender acted with a very great degree of violence toward the deceased making, the offence objectively more serious than it might otherwise have been. He both applied force, strangling her, and used the Stanley knife to cut her throat.
36I am also satisfied that the actions of the deceased were provocative and were sufficient to have occasioned an ordinary person in the offender's position to have lost his self-control. However, there are many other recorded instances of provocation more serious than the present case. The loss of self-control resulted in a brutal killing. The level of violence was of a high order. 
37When the three elements are considered, the objective gravity of the offence was very significant. The taking of human life is the most serious crime known to the law. The manner in which the offender killed his wife was brutal and must have occasioned her considerable suffering.
38Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, gave evidence. He examined the offender and having regard to the offender's account of the events and his personal circumstances, concluded that at the time of the offence the offender was suffering from a psychiatric condition identified as ""adjustment disorder with depressed mood."" Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that this was, in part, as a consequence of the offender's belief that his wife was unfaithful to him. The offender had formed this belief well before the events of 29 December. I am satisfied that his concerns and the psychiatric illness which he was suffering from contributed to his losing self-control.
39I am satisfied that the offender was an immature individual who became caught up in a situation which he was unable to effectively handle. He was far from his family and friends in India and had no resources to draw upon for emotional support. When it became apparent that his marriage had failed, he did not have the personal maturity or capacity to remove himself from the situation and avoid the conflict which ultimately took place.
40The offender has no prior criminal history and is entitled to be sentenced on that basis. The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the earliest opportunity and the Crown accepts that he is entitled to the full benefit of that plea. The Crown also accepts that it is relevant, particularly to the issue of general deterrence, that the offender was suffering from a psychiatric condition at the time the offence occurred. The need for general deterrence is thereby diminished.
41The offender is now 24 years old. He was 22 years old at the time of the offence. He comes from poor circumstances in India and will, on release from custody, inevitably be deported back to his original country. The evidence does not enable me to have a view about his prospects of employment or capacity to establish a productive life for himself when he is released.
42Although, as I have indicated, at the time of committing the offence the offender was suffering from a psychiatric illness, Dr Nielssen is now satisfied that his psychiatric well-being has been restored. I am satisfied that he is unlikely to reoffend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. These matters diminish need for personal deterrence.
43During the course of the sentencing hearing a letter which the offender has written expressing his remorse was tendered. I am satisfied that the offender regrets his actions and that his expressions of remorse are genuine. I accept that when he was an immature young person he fell in love and believed that he would spend the rest of his life with the deceased. As events unfolded, his expectation of a continuing and happy relationship was lost and without the necessary personal resources and family support he was vulnerable to the provocation that ultimately caused him to take the life of the deceased.
44Victim impact statements were provided by Jaspreet Kaur and Lakhvinder Baluja, the sisters of the deceased and Baldev Singh, the father of the deceased. Jaspreet Kaur read her statement to the court. I am no doubt that the loss of the deceased has been a great tragedy for her and her sisters and other members of her family. The loss of a family member in circumstances such as the present will always be a source of immense grief to other members of the family. I am satisfied that the deceased was an intelligent, vibrant and diligent person who was an integral part of her family's life. I have considered the victim impact statements in the manner required by the law.
45Sentencing for the crime of manslaughter is made difficult by the many ways in which the crime may be committed. When provocation can be readily identified as the occasion for forming an intention to kill, the task is made even more complex. I have been referred to a number of previous decisions to which I have given careful consideration: Goundar v R [2012] NSWCCA 87; R v Alexander, NSWCCA 24 February 1995 (unreported); R v AN [2005] NSWSC 334; R v Frost [2008] NSWSC 220; R v Gabriel [2010] NSWSC 13; R v Green [1999] NSWCCA 97; R v Hamoui [No 4] [2005] NSWSC 279; R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184; R v Jones & Ors [2007] NSWSC 1333; R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129; R v KMB [2003] NSWSC 862; R v Lynch [2002] NSWSC 1140; R v Panozzo, NSWCCA, 25 March 1993 (unreported); R v Williams [2004] NSWSC 189; R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 99; and R v Vella NSWCCA 15 December 1995 (unreported).
46I have also had the benefit of the carefully prepared submissions of counsel, both oral and in writing, which I have found of significant assistance. However, each case is unique and the appropriate sentence will depend upon the circumstances of the particular offence and of the offending.
47In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the offender must receive a prison sentence for a significant period. I see no reason for a finding of special circumstances. I shall impose a non-parole period of six years with a balance of term of two years.
48Chamanjot Singh for the offence of manslaughter you are convicted. You are sentenced to a non-parole period of six years commencing on 30 December 2009 and expiring on 29 December 2015, that being your earliest parole eligibility release date, with a balance of term of two years commencing on 30 December 2015 and expiring on 29 December 2017.

2759416,Thornton v Wollondilly Mobile Engineering [2012] NSWSC 621,"Judgment

Introduction

1On 22 March 2007, the plaintiff Jarrad Thornton, who was then an apprentice boilermaker, was working with the late Benjamin Pendergast (the deceased) at the site of the second defendant (Penrose). They were extending a platform and installing a handrail on a platform above a bin which contained sawdust shavings. The deceased was tack welding the handrail into place when he and the plaintiff noticed smoke coming from the shavings bin. As a result of the plaintiff's attempts to get help, Stan Battersby, a foreman of Penrose, opened the doors at the base of the shavings bin. The effect of the sudden influx of air caused the contents of the shavings bin to catch fire. The deceased was engulfed in flames and leapt down from the platform to escape the fire. Shortly afterwards he died from injuries he suffered when he fell.

2The plaintiff witnessed these events. He claims damages for nervous shock from Penrose arising from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its consequences for his enjoyment of life and his earning capacity. Penrose, in turn, cross-claims against the first defendant (Wollondilly), which employed the deceased and which had engaged the plaintiff through his employer Sydney Training and Employment Limited (Sydney Training).

Issues to be determined

3The following principal issues require determination:

(1)Is Penrose liable to the plaintiff in damages for negligence by reference to the Civil Liability Act 2002 (the Act)?

(2)If so, to what extent, if at all, are the plaintiff's damages to be reduced by reference to s 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 by reason of any negligence by Sydney Training?

(3)Is Wollondilly liable to Penrose on its claim for contribution under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946?

(4)Is Wollondilly liable to Penrose on its claim for property damage?

(5)If so, to what extent should such damages be reduced by reason of any contributory negligence by Penrose?

(6)Is Mr Greg Blackburn a concurrent wrongdoer within the meaning of Part 4 of the Act?

(7)If so, to what extent, if at all, should Wolllondilly's liability to Penrose under the claim for property damage be reduced?

(8)The quantum of the plaintiff's claim; Penrose's cross-claim for contribution and Penrose's claim for property damage.

Facts

Introduction

4The shavings bin was a steel-framed structure about 12 metres high which Wollondilly had constructed for Penrose. It was fed with shavings and saw dust, which were bi-products from a moulding machine which manufactured timber products. The top of the shavings bin comprised overlapping sheets of corrugated steel cladding. At its base it had hydraulic doors positioned above a loading bay. When the doors were opened, the shavings would fall into open trucks and were carted for sale elsewhere. Air cannons operated in the bin. They released compressed air along the walls of the bin to dislodge any shavings or saw dust stuck to the walls. The cannons operated only when activated by an operator. Penrose had a long-standing arrangement with Wollondilly, which had begun a decade previously, to perform metallurgical work, including plant welding, on its site.

The request for work to be performed

5Peter Cush, who was then the Managing Director of Penrose, spoke with the deceased about work that was to be done to install a second access door to a filter on top of the shavings bin. The modifications were intended to promote airflow through the filter and improve the conditions of those workers who were required to clean it. The preparatory work included extending the platform and replacing the associated handrail on top of the shavings bin.

The preparatory work

6On Thursday 22 March 2007, the plaintiff went with the deceased, and Wollondilly workers, Paul Weatherly and Tom Mortimer to Penrose's site. When they arrived at 6 am, the deceased reported to Mr Battersby.

7The plaintiff and the deceased put on harnesses to clean sawdust from the top of the shavings bin before undertaking the work of constructing the extension. Mr Weatherly and Mr Mortimer were working in a large shed about 50 metres away.

8At about 9 am, the plaintiff and the deceased finished cleaning the top of the shavings bin and went down to ground level where they joined Mr Weatherly and Mr Mortimer who were talking to Greg Blackburn, a consultant engaged by Wollondilly to advise about work safety issues. Mr Blackburn asked the Wollondilly workers, including the deceased and the plaintiff, whether they had cleaned the area and whether they were taking a fire extinguisher up with them. He advised them to wear their safety harnesses when working at a height. This conversation took about ten minutes.

9Subsequently Mr Blackburn told Mr Battersby of the work Wollondilly intended to perform that day, and told him that:

""he was there and [sic] to come and check on the boys.""

10The plaintiff and the deceased then returned to the top of the shavings bin so that the deceased could measure the lengths of steel required for the job. They went down again, took some steel lengths from the steel rack, the deceased measured out the lengths of steel and the plaintiff cut them to length using an angle grinder. The plaintiff wore head-muffs while performing this work because it was so noisy.

11They then hoisted the lengths of steel to the top of the shavings bin with rope. After a break for morning tea they donned their harnesses and attached them to the handrail of the walkway at the top of the shavings bin and started to set up.

The fire in the shavings bin

12The plaintiff and the deceased removed the old handrails, lowered them to the ground and then started to put the new steel in place by lining it up and making small tack welds. The deceased wore a helmet while he did the tack-welding to protect this face from the flashes of light that were emitted. The welding took about fifteen or twenty minutes. Welding is known as ""hot work"" because it produces hot particles, sparks and hot surfaces.

13The plaintiff noticed smoke coming through openings between the ridges in the roof of the shavings bin. The plaintiff passed a fire extinguisher to the deceased, who started to hose the roof of the shavings bin. The deceased told the plaintiff to go down and ask Mr Battersby to open the doors at the base of the shavings bin.

14When Mr Battersby opened the doors, fire engulfed the shavings bin. In order to escape the flames the deceased leapt to the ground from a height of about 9 metres. Mr Battersby was also seriously injured.

15The plaintiff went to the deceased, who was curled up on the ground on his left side. He did not respond to his name being called, but was still breathing. An ambulance arrived about half an hour after the fire had started along with police, and later, a rescue helicopter. The deceased died in the helicopter on the way to the hospital.

16Penrose pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, offences under s 8(1) and s 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (the OH&S Act) for failing to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees, in particular Mr Battersby (the s 8(1) charge) and failing to ensure that people other than its employees, in particular the deceased and the plaintiff, were not exposed to risks to their health and safety arising from the conduct of its undertaking while at its place of work (the s 8(2) charge).

17Wollondilly was convicted of offences under s 8(1) and s 8(2) of the OH&S Act for failing to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees, in particular the deceased and the plaintiff (the s 8(1) charge) and failing to ensure that people other than its employees, in particular Mr Battersby, were not exposed to risks to their health and safety arising from the conduct of its undertaking while at its place of work (the s 8(2) charge).

Liability: the plaintiff's claim

18The plaintiff initially sued both Wollondilly and Penrose. He did not pursue his claim against Wollondilly. Penrose cross-claimed against Wollondilly's insurer (whom I will also refer to as Wollondilly). 

19The plaintiff based his negligence case against Penrose, in part, on alleged breaches of Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (the Regulations), including Regulation 34, 35, 36 and 39 and alleged that Penrose was the controller of the premises within the meaning of the Regulations. 

20In Leighton Contractors Pty Limited v Fox [2009] HCA 35; 240 CLR 1 (Leighton), the High Court considered the relationship between breaches of statutory duty and the law of negligence. The Court (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Bell JJ) said, at 22:

""The obligation imposed on Leighton under the Regulation, while not founding an action for breach of statutory duty, is central to the Court of Appeal's conclusion that a common law duty existed. While it is true that obligations under statutory or other enactments have relevance to determining the existence and scope of a duty, it is necessary to exercise caution in translating the obligations imposed on employers, principal contractors and others under the OHS Act and the Regulation into a duty of care at common law. This is because, as Gummow J explained in Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) v Dederer ([2007] HCA 42; 234 CLR 330 at 345 [43]), 'whatever their scope, all duties of care are to be discharged by the exercise of reasonable care. They do not impose a more stringent or onerous burden'.""

21For this reason I do not propose to make findings as to whether any particular regulation has been breached by Penrose, since this exercise will not advance the task I have to undertake of determining whether any one or more of the defendants is liable in negligence to the plaintiff.

22Further, none of the parties contended that there was an implied repeal of the Act by the OH&S Act and Regulations. Accordingly, it is not necessary for me to determine the questions expressly left open by the Court of Appeal in Wynn Tresidder Management Pty Limited v Barkho [2009] NSWCA 149 at [87] - [101], per McColl JA (Tobias and Young JJA agreeing) including whether there is such an implied repeal.

The negligence alleged against Penrose

23The plaintiff submitted that Penrose knew that welding work would be performed on top of the shavings bin and that it owed a duty to the plaintiff to stop the moulding machine and empty the shavings bin before the welding work was performed. Penrose accepted that if I found that it knew that the work was to be performed, it was negligent, and liable to the plaintiff.

24The plaintiff also submitted that Penrose was negligent because it was vicariously liable for the acts of Mr Battersby, who opened the doors to the shavings bin when the plaintiff passed on the deceased's request that he do so. This caused a, influx of oxygen sufficient to enlarge the fire and engulf the bin in flames. To save himself, the deceased jumped.

Whether and at what stage Penrose was aware that welding work would be performed on top of the shavings bin

25Penrose's defence to the plaintiff's claim was that it was not aware that welding was to be conducted on the top of the shavings bin. Accordingly, there was no obligation on it to empty the bin or stop the moulding machine. It is therefore necessary to examine the evidence as to whether, and when, Penrose became aware of the welding work that was performed on the shavings bin on the day of the accident.

Discussions with Mr Cush

26About a month before the accident, Mr Cush spoke with the deceased and Michael Turner, a principal of Wollondilly, about the proposed modifications to the bin. Mr Cush's evidence was that he told the deceased that the job would require careful planning because of the potential for fire, since the hot work provided a potential ignition source. The moulding machine would have to be stopped while the hot work was being done which would require planning because of the importance of the moulding machine to Penrose's production. He requested that the deceased speak to Mr Turner so that Penrose and Wollondilly could develop a safe procedure for doing the work. 

27Mr Cush said that it was the usual practice of Penrose and Wollondilly for any significant work to be planned and the site at which it was to be performed to be inspected before the work was done. I accept his evidence that he did not expect the job to be started until a safe procedure had been determined. When Mr Cush was told at the beginning of the week of the accident that Wollondilly was sending workers to Penrose to do work, Mr Cush did not understand that they proposed to do work on the shavings bin. There was other work being done by Wollondilly for Penrose in that period. 

28Although I accept that Mr Cush spoke to either or both of Mr Turner and the deceased about the need for planning the job, I am not satisfied that Mr Cush specifically adverted to the potential for fire and the need to empty the bin and stop the moulding machine. I consider that Mr Cush's recollection is affected by hindsight and a sense of regret and, possibly, culpability for what occurred. Mr Cush was obviously deeply affected by the tragedy of what occurred and thoughts of those conversations have probably been replayed in his mind over the intervening years.

29Furthermore, I am not satisfied that when Mr Cush spoke of the need for planning the job, the deceased understood him to mean that this was required for the work of installing the walkway and replacing the handrail, as distinct from the more substantial work of cutting the door in the filter. 

Information given to Mr Battersby on the day of the accident

30The deceased had worked on the site from time to time for a few years before the accident. It was his usual practice, as the Wollondilly supervisor, to inform Mr Battersby when he arrived at Penrose's site of the work that Wollondilly intended to perform that day. Mr Battersby agreed that the work actually performed usually corresponded with the work the deceased had described on any given morning.

31The Wollondilly workers arrived at Penrose's site at about 6 am. The deceased reported to Mr Battersby who was in the site office. Mr Battersby gave evidence that the deceased told him that he was going to go up to the top of the shavings bin to measure the lengths of steel required and cut those lengths on the ground. Mr Battersby could not recall the deceased telling him that Wollondilly also intended to construct a new handrail on top of the shavings bin.

32The plaintiff understood the task for that day to include extending a steel platform above a large sawdust shavings bin in the sawmill and constructing a new handrail in the vicinity of the filter box on top of the shavings bin.

33Although I consider Mr Battersby to be an honest witness I do not consider that his lack of recollection of the full extent of the work actually performed means that the deceased did not inform him of it. His recollection is affected not only by the passage of time, but also by the serious injuries he sustained in the accident and his involvement in the actions that led to the death of the deceased. I consider these factors to have been influential in affecting his memory as to what he was told by the deceased and also, later, by the plaintiff. Mr Battersby conceded, and I accept, that his memory of what the deceased had told him could have been defective.

34I am not satisfied that the deceased departed from his usual practice of giving an accurate daily description to Mr Battersby of the work that Wollondilly was to perform at Penrose's site. I find, accordingly, that the deceased told Mr Battersby of his intention to construct a handrail on top of the shavings bin. I accept Mr Battersby's evidence that if he had appreciated that hot work would have been involved he would have stopped the machine that fed the shavings bin with shavings because of the risk of the shavings catching fire. It is probable that although the deceased told Mr Battersby that he was going to install a handrail on the shavings bin, Mr Battersby did not appreciate that such installation would necessarily involve hot work. It follows that Penrose was, or ought to have been aware, through Mr Battersby, that welding equipment would be used there.

35Although I accept Penrose's submission that it would be unreasonable to require Mr Battersby, who was relevantly unqualified, to conduct an interrogation of Wollondilly's workers to ascertain whether they were complying with safe work practices in performing hot work, I consider that in circumstances where he was aware of the work that was to be done on the shavings bin, Penrose was negligent in not telling Wollondilly that the work could not be done there unless the shavings bin was emptied and the moulding machine stopped while the welding was being done.

The conduct of Mr Battersby: opening the doors to the shavings bin

36Shortly before the accident Mr Battersby received a call on a two-way radio from James Hansen, a loader driver employed by Penrose, who told him that there was smoke coming out of the shavings bin. As he walked towards the shavings bin, Mr Battersby came across the plaintiff coming towards him. According to the plaintiff, he not only asked Mr Battersby to come and open the lower doors to the shavings bin, but he also told him that there was a fire. Mr Battersby denied that the plaintiff told him that there was a fire. I prefer Mr Battersby's evidence on this question, since I consider that if the plaintiff had mentioned the word ""fire"", Mr Battersby would not have opened the shavings bin unless he had satisfied himself that there was no fire.

37When Mr Battersby approached, he concluded that what Mr Hansen had thought was smoke was no more than fine shavings dust, which he usually observed whenever he opened the doors to the shavings bin to load a truck, as he had done about an hour before. Mr Battersby said that he did not smell any smoke. I accept Mr Battersby's evidence that had he realised that smoke was being emitted from the shavings bin, he would not have opened the doors.

38Unlike the deceased, Mr Battersby appreciated that opening the doors would aggravate the fire, if there be one. The only urgency associated with opening the doors was that engendered by the deceased and the plaintiff. Mr Battersby, with his superior knowledge of the flammability of shavings in the bin when the doors were open, was under no obligation to open the doors in a hurry, and without consideration of the risk that what Mr Hansen had seen was smoke. I accept that at that time, Mr Battersby did not appreciate that there was ignition source on the top of the shavings bin, although, as I have found above, he should have been aware that there was from the description of the work to be performed that the deceased had given him that morning.

39Mr Battersby agreed that if there was smoke there must have been fire. To open the doors when there was a possibility of a fire inside was negligent because of the foreseeable consequence that the influx of oxygen could fuel the fire and enlarge its effect, thereby endangering persons in the vicinity, including the deceased. Mr Hansen worked at Penrose and I infer that he was familiar with the sight of the fine dust that emanated from the base of the shavings bin. Although he may not have been as expert at identifying fine dust as Mr Battersby, I do not consider that it was reasonable for Mr Battersby to dismiss his observation so quickly. 

Whether Penrose was negligent

40The shavings in the bin were flammable. It was foreseeable that the shavings in the bin would catch fire. The risk of their catching alight as a result of hot work being performed on the bin was not insignificant. 

41Because shavings burn so easily, it is likely that if the shavings in the bin caught fire, the harm would be serious having regard to the size of the bin and the difficulty of controlling the fire once it started. If there was a fire in the bin, it would be aggravated by the opening of the doors at its base because of the tendency of oxygen to promote combustion.

42The matters referred to above are all matters which Penrose knew or ought to have known.

43A reasonable person in the position of Penrose would have taken the precautions of emptying the shavings bin and stopping the moulding machine that fed shavings and sawdust into the bin whenever hot work was conducted on top of the bin. Mr Battersby agreed that this is what he would have done if he had known that hot work was being performed. I have found that Penrose knew or ought to have known that welding was to be conducted.

44A reasonable person in the position of Penrose would not have opened the doors to the shavings bin unless reasonable enquiries had been made to exclude the presence of smoke emanating from the shavings bin.

45No evidence was adduced that tended to suggest that the taking of such precautions would be onerous or would outweigh the social utility of creating wood products from local timber or performing associated welding work on a shavings bin.

46Accordingly, a finding of negligence is not precluded by s 5B of the Act. None of the principles outlined in s 5C has any particular application here. 

Causal connection between Penrose's negligence and the harm suffered

The cause of the fire

47The first question that arises is the cause of the fire. 

48Penrose admitted, in a Statement of Agreed Facts filed in a prosecution brought against it pursuant to the OH&S Act:

""The likely cause of the initial fire within the shavings bin was the ignition of wood shavings and saw dust by hot sparks or molten metal from the grinding and welding work being performed by Pendergast and Thornton.""

49Because the admission constitutes evidence rather than a pleading in these proceedings, it is not binding on Penrose and I must take into account other evidence on this issue. Furthermore, the cause of the fire is also relevant to Wollondilly's liability and Penrose's admission is not admissible against it.

50Ray Manser, whose report was relied upon by the plaintiff, opined that a spark from the welding equipment was a likely cause of the fire. It then became apparent that Mr Manser used the word ""likely"" as a synonym for possible, rather than probable. Mr Manser identified other possible causes of the fire and was not prepared to say that one was more probable than any other. It appears from the following passage that Mr Manser was not prepared to venture such an opinion in the absence of a full scientific investigation:

""Q. And as I understand it from your report you disagreed that the probable cause was sparks emanating or something else emanating from the hot work being done by Mr Pendergast up on silo?

A. No I didn't disagree it could have been a likely cause. I said if an investigation was done in accordance with the scientific procedures of NFPA document 921 which is in the annexure, the scientific procedure would have looked at all possible causes, promoted a hypothesis and tested that hypothesis on whether that was the cause or not. The problem with this [is] there was never a proper fire investigation done.""

51In these circumstances, I do not consider that Mr Manser's unwillingness to express an opinion as to the probable cause of the fire prevents the plaintiff, or indeed any other party, establishing the cause of the fire on the balance of probabilities.

52The facts relevant to ascertaining the cause of the fire are:

(1) Welding work creates a substantial risk of fire when performed in the vicinity of shavings, particularly where it is done on or near a metal surface such as the corrugated iron sheeting on top of a shavings bin.

(2) Welding work was performed on top of the shavings bin immediately before smoke was first observed.

(3) The doors to the shavings bin had been opened that morning by Mr Battersby about an hour before the accident to load a truck. Mr Battersby could not say whether this had emptied the bin. Nor could he estimate the quantity of shavings that remained in the bin after he had loaded the truck.

(4) At the time of the accident, the moulding machine was idling while Theo Jongsma, who operated the moulding machine, was straightening out the timber to grade it. The moulding machine had not been operating for about half an hour before the accident. There was no saw dust being transported through the dust extraction system from the moulding machine into the shavings bin at that time. The air cannons were not operating.

(5) Mr Jongsma who had operated moulding machines for 33 years had never known the machine to create sparks.

(6) Mr Jongsma did not know that any hot work was to be performed on the shavings bin on the day of the accident and took no steps to stop the moulding machine while it was being done.

53An inability to call lay or expert evidence that shows the precise way that something has happened is not fatal: see Bendix Mintex Pty Ltd v Barnes (1997) 42 NSWLR 307 at 317, per Mason P, referring to Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd v Forst [1940] HCA 45; 64 CLR 538. In that case a worker performed two strenuous tasks and then collapsed and died of coronary thrombosis. There was expert evidence, which was accepted by the arbitrator, to the effect that death from coronary thrombosis could not generally be related to exertion. The Supreme Court of South Australia overturned the arbitrator's finding and the employer appealed to the High Court. The High Court dismissed the appeal on the basis of a ""presumptive inference which this sequence of events would naturally inspire in the mind of any common-sense person uninstructed in pathology"" (at 563 - 564, per Rich ACJ).

54I consider that the facts set out above are sufficient to give rise to a presumptive inference of a causal link between the welding work and the fire in the shavings bin. I do not consider Mr Manser's evidence, which reflects a disinclination to opine on causation in the absence of a full scientific investigation, to be sufficient to rebut it. My conclusion is fortified by the apparent dearth of evidence concerning incidents where there has been spontaneous combustion of shavings in a bin in the absence of an apparent ignition source. Mr Manser conducted some research on the Internet to ascertain whether there had been any such incidents. He was aware of one: in Dungog in 2008, after this incident. Mr Cush had never heard of a fire in a shavings bin, although he had been involved with Penrose for 30 years.

55I find that the probable cause of the fire was a spark or molten metal from the welding work performed on top of the shavings bin which ignited shavings or sawdust in, or on top of the bin.

56Wollondilly sought to dissuade me from drawing this inference by formally calling on Penrose for:

""any expert's reports stating, investigating and expressing expert opinion on the events that give rise to these proceedings.""

57Penrose produced a report from Commercial and Criminal Forensic dated 12 April 2007. In submissions, Wollondilly submitted that I could draw a Jones v Dunkel inference against Penrose because it did not tender the report. Penrose then sought leave to re-open to tender the report to rebut any inference and Wollondilly objected. 

58The call made by Wollondilly was so broad that I could not confidently conclude that the report produced to answer it contained an opinion as to the cause of the fire. But in any event the force of the inference is only that the evidence would not have assisted the case of Penrose. Indeed there is also an inference that it would not have assisted the case of Wollondilly, since the report could also have been tendered by it: Galea v Bagtrans Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 350. Even if the inference were open in respect of the expert who wrote the report called for, a matter about which I entertain some doubt, it does not affect the substantial strength of the inference as to the cause of the fire. 

59Penrose's negligence, as found above, caused the fire. The negligence of Penrose in opening the doors to the shavings bin after smoke had been observed aggravated the fire.

60I am persuaded that Penrose's negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm and also that it is appropriate for its liability to extend to the harm so caused within the meaning of s 5D of the Act.

61It follows that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against Penrose.

Assessment of damages under the Act

Facts

62The plaintiff was 17 at the time of the accident, and is now almost 23. He left school in 2005 once he had completed Year 10. The following year he started work as an apprentice boilermaker with Nepean Engineering. After about seven months the plaintiff left his position and worked in his father's rose-growing business until about February 2007. His supervisor at Nepean Engineering recorded on the termination form that the plaintiff had left of his own accord ""as he didn't like the work"" but noted that he would re-employ the plaintiff. The plaintiff denied that he had told anyone that he did not like the work. He said that he left because he did not get along with some of his co-workers.

63He then worked for Wollondilly at Picton. According to his mother, Mrs Thornton, ""he seemed very happy"". As a second year apprentice, he cut steel, welded and retrieved and sealed the tools for the other operators.

64The deceased was the plaintiff's workshop supervisor.

65The plaintiff felt guilty about what happened to the deceased and blamed himself for not being able to save him. He became upset and cried. He was anxious, angry, aggressive and violent. In the following weeks he drank himself to sleep. He had previously consumed alcohol, mainly beer, but after the accident he took to consuming large quantities of it, including spirits. His alcohol consumption has since returned to a more socially acceptable level.

66The plaintiff took a fortnight off work. He was greatly affected by the deceased's funeral. He spent time with the deceased's parents. He had frequent nightmares.

67He was reluctant to return to work, but he persevered with obtaining his trade certificate. When he did so, his work performance was poor and gave rise to complaints. He constantly had the feeling that something was about to go wrong. In July 2007 he saw Barbara McKern, a psychologist, at the request of Wollondilly. When she suggested that he needed medication, including anti-depressants, he became scared and did not see her again and avoided medical practitioners until he saw Dr Rankin at Bargo in October 2007.

68According to Mrs Thornton, the plaintiff was ""in a terrible mess"" for a couple of years after the accident. He has improved but not consistently. The anniversary of the accident and the surrounding period is particularly difficult.

69Because of the difficulties the plaintiff was having working with Wollondilly, Sydney Training permitted him to change secondment to H & H Steel Pty Limited (H & H). Sydney Training also referred him to Alex Frater, a psychologist at Campbelltown, whom he consulted from April until December 2008. He did not complete the course of therapy and has not had further counselling since that time. The plaintiff told Dr Pickering that he stopped attending counselling sessions with Mr Frater because they were no longer helpful.

70When he completed his apprenticeship in August 2009, the plaintiff received his trade certificate, but he left H & H because he did not want to be a boilermaker. He was permitted, apparently on compassionate grounds, to complete his apprenticeship a year early on 12 August 2009. But for the accident, he would not have completed his apprenticeship until 12 August 2010.

71 He has worked for periods as a boilermaker since receiving his trade certificate, but only in the workshop and not on site. He worked at Brookvale from 22 November 2010 to 19 December 2010 and resumed on 10 January 2011 until 27 February 2011. During this period he lived with his girlfriend at Galston. He also worked at Maitland for three weeks in metal fabrication. He says that he has worked as a boilermaker when he needed more money than he could earn when working for his father. 

72The plaintiff applied for a position with the NSW police force but did not proceed with his application because of his concerns about handling stressful situations.

73He told Dr Pickering in April 2011 that he was thinking about doing a business course in connection with the flower growing industry but he said in evidence that he had not done the course and was no longer considering it.

74His relationship with his girlfriend, which began around the time of the accident, has been adversely affected by the accident, although they are still together.

75He presently works in his father's rose-growing business at Thirlmere where he picks, packs and delivers roses and does other general duties. He lives with either his father or his mother, who, though separated, live a short distance apart. From time to time he has supplemented his income by working as a boilermaker, as referred to above.

Expert opinion evidence

76The only significant difference between the opinions of the psychiatrists, Dr Pickering and Dr Selwyn-Smith is the extent to which, if at all, the plaintiff's earning capacity has been affected by PTSD. Both experts agree that the plaintiff developed PTSD as a result of the accident and that this disorder has remitted significantly.

77Dr Pickering opined, when he saw him for medicolegal assessment in April 2011, that the plaintiff had made an incomplete recovery. The panic attacks that he had previously experienced no longer occur. Dr Pickering identified the major lasting consequence of the PTSD as being his inability to work on site as a boilermaker and considered him to be permanently unfit for sustained employment in a workshop setting and entirely unfit to work on site in his trade. Dr Pickering considered that, while it is unusual for someone with PTSD to have such generalised aversions, the plaintiff has residual symptoms of avoidance which prevent his continuing in his trade.

78By contrast, Dr Smith opined that there was no impairment in the plaintiff's ability to perform his duties. He considered the plaintiff's generalised aversion to working as a boilermaker was caused by extraneous reasons, which could be related to increased alcohol consumption.

Non-economic loss

79The plaintiff is entitled to non-economic loss against Penrose only if I am satisfied that the severity of non-economic loss is at least 15% of a most extreme case: s 16 of the Act.

80The plaintiff suffered a serious and traumatic event, which affected his life significantly, at least in the couple of years following it. It will continue to affect his life because of its undoubted trauma and the plaintiff's relative youth at the time of the accident. Nonetheless there has been a significant recovery, although residual symptoms persist.

81I find that the severity of the plaintiff's non-economic loss is 25% of a most extreme case. Accordingly, he is entitled to $34,000 pursuant to the scale set out in s 16 of the Act.

Damages for past economic loss due to loss of earnings

82The plaintiff makes no claim for past economic loss until August 2009, when he completed his apprenticeship.

83When the plaintiff was working as an apprentice on secondment to Wollondilly, he was paid about $17,000 net per annum, or $327 per week.

84The plaintiff claims that but for the accident he would have worked a 35-hour week and been paid $32.50 per hour in the year ending 30 June 2010 and that his hourly rate would have increased to $40 in the following years. 

85In order to fortify his claim for economic loss, the plaintiff relied on advertisements for boilermaking jobs in Western Australia which advertised higher rates of pay than that for which he is claiming. I do not find these advertisements of particular assistance since there is no assessment of the costs that might be incurred in travelling and living in such locations. Furthermore, I am not satisfied that but for the accident the plaintiff would have been inclined to travel to such locations in any event to obtain work.

86I consider that the plaintiff's capacity to work in an unrestricted way as a boilermaker is diminished. It is not reasonable to expect him to return to a position that would put him in circumstances reminiscent of those surrounding the accident. In particular, working on site at heights may be difficult for him for the foreseeable future.

87On the other hand, he is a young, physically fit man who has shown not only stoicism in his determination to obtain his trade certificate as a boilermaker but has also demonstrated his ability to work as a boilermaker since becoming qualified, when financial considerations motivate him to do so. That he took only a fortnight off after the accident, and that no claim for economic loss is made for the following year is testament both to his capacity, and his fortitude.

88There is some indication that the plaintiff would not necessarily have continued with his trade, since he left Nepean Engineering and worked in his father's rose-growing business before the accident and before he started working for Wollondilly. It appears that his parents instilled in him the importance of obtaining a trade certificate, so that he would always have a qualification to ""fall back on"". However, I am not satisfied that, but for the accident, the plaintiff would necessarily have continued working as a boilermaker for the rest of his working life.

89In the year ended 30 June 2010 the plaintiff received a total of $7,579 from his short-term boiler-making work at H & H and his work with the family rose-growing business. I accept Penrose's submission that but for the accident, the plaintiff would have continued as an apprentice with Wollondilly until August 2010 and, accordingly, been paid at apprentice rates. I accept that his earning capacity in the year ended 30 June 2010 was affected by the accident and I allow a loss of $10,000 for that year, being the approximate difference between what he would have earned as an apprentice and what he in fact earned.

90In the year ended 30 June 2011, the plaintiff's net earnings were $23,985. I accept that they were likely to have been substantially higher but for the accident and the aversion it caused to his working on-site as a boilermaker. However, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff would necessarily have worked full-time as a boiler-maker in any event and may well have found other employment. I propose to allow a sum of $20,000 for this period.

91In the period from 1 July 2011 until judgment I accept that there is still some diminution in the plaintiff's earning capacity arising from PTSD, which disinclines him to travel far from home for long periods, or to engage in full-time employment as a boilermaker. I also accept that these proceedings are likely to have aggravated the plaintiff's symptoms, at least in the lead-up to, and during, the hearing. I allow the sum of $20,000 for this period.

92The plaintiff is entitled to interest on these damages under s 18 of the Act. I request that the parties calculate the applicable interest and bring in short minutes of order reflecting their calculations.

Loss of past superannuation benefits

93I have calculated this head by reference to 11% of the net figure for past economic loss.

Damages for future economic loss due to the deprivation of earning capacity

94I have recorded in the reasons above my impression of the plaintiff's prospects of employment and my conclusion that it was by no means probable that but for the accident the plaintiff would have continued as a boilermaker.

95Nonetheless I accept that this traumatic event and its consequences result in a diminution of the plaintiff's earning capacity in that he will be unable to work in circumstances which might evoke similar circumstances to those which surrounded the death of the deceased.

96If the plaintiff continues in the family rose-growing business, it will be, in my view, because of his preference for so doing and his fondness for the work and the surrounding area rather than because of any diminution in his earning capacity occasioned by the accident. The plaintiff could, in my view, retrain for another trade or occupation other than boilermaking. Although some occupations, such as police officer, may be unsuitable because it may tend to expose the plaintiff to horrifying sights, there are many other occupations open to the plaintiff, notwithstanding the accident.

97I do not consider that it is appropriate to apply a mathematical approach as if the loss of earning capacity will continue in any uniform way into the future. Section 13 of the Act does not preclude the award of damages by way of a buffer in circumstances where the impact of the injury on earning capacity is difficult to determine: Penrith City Council v Parks [2004] NSWCA 201 at [5], per Giles JA, with whom Cripps JA agreed. In these circumstances, there is no question of a percentage adjustment, and so in the application of s 13(2), the percentage adjustment is nil.

98I allow a buffer of $100,000 for future economic loss, which includes loss of future superannuation benefits.

Out of pocket expenses: past and future

99There is no claim for out-of-pocket expenses.

Schedule of damages

100For the foregoing reasons I assess damages as follows, subject to the application of s 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act, which is considered below:





Head of damages

Amount

$100,000

The application of s 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act

101The plaintiff conceded that, had he sued his employer, he would not have reached the threshold of ""at least 15%"" provided for under s 151H of the Workers Compensation Act in light of relevant lay and medical evidence and the WorkCover Guidelines (the Guidelines). Accordingly, the damages to which the plaintiff would be entitled from Sydney Training are zero: Izzard v Dunbier Marine Products (NSW) Pty Limited [2012] NSWCA 132 (Izzard) at [41] per Basten JA, [114] - [118] per Macfarlan JA and [140] - [148] per Barrett JA. 

102Sydney Training, as the plaintiff's employer, had a non-delegable duty to take reasonable steps to provide the plaintiff with a safe system of work. It is vicariously liable for any negligence committed by Wollondilly, since it entrusted it with the discharge of its duty: s 5Q of the Act.

103There is no evidence that Sydney Training did anything material to discharge this duty. It contacted the plaintiff by telephone from time to time from its own premises in Sydney. It placed him with Wollondilly but did not inspect either Wollondilly's premises, or those of Penrose. It did not provide him with safety training. A representative of Sydney Training would visit the plaintiff at his home, or after the accident, at H & H's premises. It effectively sought to abdicate its responsibility to the plaintiff. It was not entitled do so. It was in breach of the non-delegable duty of care which it owed to the plaintiff.

104I consider that Penrose would, but for Part 5 of the Workers Compensation Act, have been able to recover 30% of its liability from Sydney Training as contribution but which is not in fact recoverable (due to s 151H in Division 3 of Part 5): Izzard, at [124] per Macfarlan JA.

105In those circumstances, the effect of s 151Z(2)(c) is to reduce the damages recoverable by the plaintiff from Penrose by the 30% of the plaintiff's damages that Penrose would have otherwise been able to recover from Sydney Training. This deduction ought be reflected in the short minutes of orders that the parties bring in to reflect these reasons.

Penrose's cross-claim against Wollondilly: whether Wollondilly would be liable if sued by the plaintiff

106Penrose's cross-claim has two elements: a claim for economic loss arising from damage to the shavings bin and a claim for indemnity and contribution for any damages for which Penrose is found to be liable to the plaintiff.

Wollondilly's duty

107Wollondilly sought to minimise its obligation by submitting that the plaintiff and the deceased were essentially ""guest workers"" at Penrose's premises and that Penrose was accordingly obliged to ensure that they were trained in safety procedures and that the premises be made safe for whatever work they were engaged to do. This submission is at odds with Leighton, where the High Court found that Leighton was not obliged, as the principal contractor, to provide training in the safe method of carrying on every trade and conducting every specialised activity carried out on the site to every worker on the site. It emphasised the distinction that the common law draws between the obligations of employers to their employees and of principals to independent contractors.

108As referred to above, it is common ground that the plaintiff was employed by Sydney Training. As far as Wollondilly was concerned he was an independent contractor, having been seconded by Sydney Training to Wollondilly for his apprenticeship.

109The duty Wollondilly owed to the plaintiff is substantially the same as if he had been Wollondilly's employee: Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Limited [1986] HCA 1;160 CLR 16 at 31, per Mason J. The difference between the plaintiff, who was employed by Sydney Training, and his co-workers, who were employed by Wollondilly, was that the plaintiff was an apprentice. It is difficult to see that there would be any material difference in the way in which Wollondilly treated and directed the plaintiff had he been one of its employees. Wollondilly had a right, which it exercised, to control the plaintiff in the work he performed on its behalf and for its benefit. Indeed the standard of care owed to the plaintiff was, if anything, higher than that owed to employees because of his particular vulnerability as an apprentice.

110The duty Wollondilly owed to the plaintiff was akin to that which would have been owed had he been an employee, namely a duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing him to the risk of injury: Rockdale Beef Pty Limited v Carey [2003] NSWCA 132 at [94], per Ipp JA (Mason P and McColl JA agreeing). It owed a non-delegable duty to the plaintiff to prescribe and provide a safe system of work: TNT Australia Pty Limited v Christie [2003] NSWCA 47; 65 NSWLR 1 at [41], per Mason P and [178], per Foster AJA. To the extent to which Wollondilly entrusted its duty to Mr Blackburn, it is vicariously liable for any breach by him: s 5Q of the Act.

111Wollondilly also sought to minimise its obligation and share of responsibility for what occurred by submitting that Penrose, as the occupier of the premises, owed them a non-delegable duty to take reasonable care to make the premises safe. This submission that an occupier's duty is non-delegable would appear to be at odds with what the majority of the High Court decided in Northern Sandblasting v Harris [1997] HCA 39; 188 CLR 313; namely, that the duty owed by a landlord to the occupants was not non-delegable and could be discharged by engaging a competent tradesperson to perform repairs. Further, there is no particular analogy between an occupier and an invitee and this case. The plaintiff and the deceased were on Penrose's premises because Penrose had engaged Wollondilly for reward to perform work. Wollondilly sent its employees to the premises to perform that work on its behalf.

112The following statement from Mason P's judgment in TNT, at [67] concerning the labour-hire company, Manpower, applies as much, in my view, to Wollondilly as it does to Sydney Training: 

""In my view, it would be contrary to principle to enable or even to encourage an employer that operates a labour hire business to treat the normal incidents of the employment relationship as modified simply because its employees are sent off to work for a client. Indeed, the very fact that employees are dispatched to external venues and placed under the de facto management of outsiders will, in some cases, have the practical effect of requiring the employer to adopt additional measures by way of warning or training in order to discharge its continuing common law duty of care to its employees.""

Wollondilly's breach

113As between Wollondilly and Penrose, Wollondilly had a higher duty to safeguard its employees and a quasi-employee such as the plaintiff than did Penrose. It was negligent in failing to train them in safe work practices and in failing to bring to their attention the dangers of working on a shavings bin while it contained shavings and was in operation. It also failed to instruct them that if there was a possibility of a fire in a shavings bin, the prudent course was to disembark from the bin as soon as possible because of the potential for the fire to get out of control. As Mr Manser said, a fire in a silo bin makes the silo a ""very risky place to be"".

114Mr Turner said that it was only with the benefit of hindsight that he appreciated that there was a risk in performing hot work on top of the shavings bin while it contained shavings. He knew in advance that the work that was in fact done on the day of the accident was going to be done that day. The effect of his evidence was that he did nothing to warn the deceased or the plaintiff because he had not considered that there was a risk in their performing the work. He left it to the deceased and Mr Blackburn to work out how the work could be performed. Wollondilly is responsible for his, and Mr Blackburn's negligence.

115Wollondilly failed to comply with Australian Standard 1674 (AS 1674) which makes provision for Safety in welding and allied processes. Sawmills are included in the definition of hazardous areas. A form is provided for a ""Hot Work Permit"", which is one of the matters to be arranged before hot work is performed in any hazardous area, whereby the employer (or person performing the hot work) would obtain a permit from the occupier of the premises on which the hot work was to be performed.

116Wollondilly knew what its workers were to do on the day of the accident. It ought to have known of the dangers of their performing welding work on the shavings bin and not only warned them of the dangers but ensured that the work was not performed until the bin was emptied and the moulding machine stopped.

Causation: whether Wollondilly's breach caused loss

117Wollondilly submitted that, even were I to find that it was in breach, the real cause of the damage both to the plaintiff, the deceased and the shavings bin was Mr Battersby's act of opening the doors to the shavings bin, for which Penrose was liable. It relied, in part, on the following passages from Mr Manser's evidence:

""Q. The activities that Mr Pendergast conducted on the silo would not have resulted in the damage to the silo or Mr Pendergast without Mr Battersby's intervention?

A. Correct.

Q. Had Mr Battersby not opened the gates no damage would have occurred to a silo or Mr Pendergast?

A. That's correct.""

118Wollondilly relied on Bennett v Minister of Community Welfare [1992] HCA 27; 176 CLR 408 in support of the proposition that opening the doors had broken the chain of causation. I was referred to what McHugh J said in Bennett, at [13]:

""The causal connection between a defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's damage is negatived by the subsequent conduct of another person only when that conduct is 'the free, deliberate and informed act or omission of a human being, intended to exploit the situation created by defendant' (Hart and Honore, Causation In The Law, 2nd ed. (1985), p 136). When the subsequent conduct is a cause of the damage but is unrelated to the situation created by the earlier negligence, the subsequent conduct and the earlier negligence are treated as separate and independent causes of the damage.""

119I do not consider that this passage assists Wollondilly. Mr Battersby's act was related to the situation created by the earlier negligence. Even if it could be regarded as free or deliberate, it was not informed, since Mr Battersby thought, mistakenly, that what Mr Hansen had identified as smoke was fine dust. Had he recognised it for what it was, smoke, he would not have opened the doors.

120I do not consider that it is appropriate to exclude the initial cause of the fire as a cause of the damage to the plaintiff and the deceased. Although the fire was fuelled by additional oxygen when the doors were opened the causal effect of the initial fire was still operative when the damage occurred. The initial fire and the opening of the doors were concurrent causes of the damage. When a fire is caused as a result of a wrongful act, its aggravation is the very thing that is likely to happen if others, including the original tortfeasor, respond in a negligent way.

121In March v Stramare [1991] HCA 12; 171 CLR 506, the High Court considered whether the causal effect of the negligent parking of a vegetable truck in the middle of the road was superseded or exhausted by the act of an intoxicated driver, who collided with the truck at excessive speed. The Court found that the owner and driver of the truck were liable for the injuries to the driver because their wrongful act of parking the truck in the middle of the road had created the very risk that a careless driver would collide with it. Mason CJ said, at [27]:

""As a matter of both logic and common sense, it makes no sense to regard the negligence of the plaintiff or a third party as a superseding cause or novus actus interveniens when the defendant's wrongful conduct has generated the very risk of injury resulting from the negligence of the plaintiff or a third party and that injury occurs in the ordinary course of things. In such a situation, the defendant's negligence satisfies the 'but for' test and is properly to be regarded as a cause of the consequence because there is no reason in common sense, logic or policy for refusing to so regard it.""

122I do not accept Wollondilly's submission that the opening of the doors was an intervening act that broke the chain of causation between the initial fire and the damage that ensued. As I have said above, it is foreseeable that when a fire starts something will happen that will make the fire more difficult to control. This is what occurred when Mr Battersby opened the doors to the shavings bin. I consider that Wollondilly's negligence in permitting the deceased and the plaintiff to do hot work on the top of the shavings bin when it had not been emptied is, as a matter of commonsense and experience properly to be seen as having caused the harm: Medlin v State Government Insurance Commission [1995] HCA 5; 182 CLR 1 at [6].

123It follows that there will be judgment for Penrose on its cross-claim.

Apportionment

124In its cross-claim, Penrose seeks contribution from Wollondilly pursuant to s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.

125As between Wollondilly and Penrose I consider that it is just and equitable that Wollondilly bear the substantial portion of responsibility for the plaintiff's loss. Had it discharged its duty, neither the deceased nor the plaintiff would have been on top of the shavings bin when there were shavings inside and when the moulding machine was still operating. The fire would not have started. If they had been properly trained, the deceased would not have remained on the bin for the time it took the plaintiff to go and speak with Mr Battersby and have him return to open the doors to the bin. They would both have removed themselves from the smoke as quickly as possible in order to alert others to the presence of the smoke.

126As between Wollondilly and Penrose I find Wollondilly to be liable for 60% of the amount for which Penrose is liable to the plaintiff. The apportionment between Wollondilly and Penrose is accordingly 60% to Wollondilly and 40% to Penrose.

Penrose's cross-claim for property damage

127Penrose also alleges in its cross-claim against Wollondilly that Wollondilly is liable for the property damage to the shavings bin.

128Wollondilly owed a duty to Penrose to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable damage caused by those persons under its care and control to Penrose's property (Dorset Yacht Co v Home Office [1970] AC 1004). It was foreseeable that if its employees were permitted to perform welding work on a shavings bin which contained shavings and which was being fed by a moulding machine, there was a risk that the shavings would catch fire and damage the bin. Wollondilly's negligence caused the damage to the shavings bin since, as I have found above, the fire was probably caused by a spark from the welding work performed by the deceased.

129The cross-claim by Penrose for property damage is an ""apportionable claim"" within the meaning of s 34 of the Act. Accordingly Part 4 applies.

130Section 35 relevantly provides:

""(1) In any proceedings involving an apportionable claim: 

(a) the liability of a defendant who is a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to that claim is limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the damage or loss claimed that the court considers just having regard to the extent of the defendant's responsibility for the damage or loss, and

(b) the court may give judgment against the defendant for not more than that amount.

...

(3) In apportioning responsibility between defendants in the proceedings:

(a) the court is to exclude that proportion of the damage or loss in relation to which the plaintiff is contributorily negligent under any relevant law, and

(b) the court may have regard to the comparative responsibility of any concurrent wrongdoer who is not a party to the proceedings.

(4) This section applies in proceedings involving an apportionable claim whether or not all concurrent wrongdoers are parties to the proceedings.""

131Penrose contributed to its own loss in various ways. First, it did not warn Wollondilly that the shavings bin would need to be emptied before the welding work could be performed on it, either when Mr Cush met with Mr Turner or when the deceased spoke with Mr Battersby on the morning of the accident. Secondly, it did not have any system in place to ensure that the doors to the shavings bin were not opened if there was any smoke in the vicinity which might reveal that there was a fire inside the bin. Its conduct (through Mr Battersby) in opening the doors to the bin, notwithstanding that smoke had been detected, substantially aggravated the fire and the consequential damage to the bin.

132I consider that Penrose's contributory negligence leads to a deduction of 70% of the damages to which it would otherwise be entitled against Wollondilly.

133Wollondilly has identified Mr Blackburn as a concurrent wrongdoer within the meaning of Part 4 of the Act. He is not a party to the proceedings. There is evidence to the effect that he cannot be found. Wollondilly alleges that Mr Blackburn breached his engagement contract with Wollondilly by failing to implement a hot work system. Wollondilly also alleges that Mr Blackburn was aware of the work being performed on the day and failed to advise its workers of steps that could have been taken with respect to the danger involved in the work.

134Mr Blackburn saw the deceased and the plaintiff beside the shavings bin on the day of the accident. He knew that they intended to do welding work on the structure which was a shavings bin on that day. Indeed he advised them to wear safety harnesses and take a fire extinguisher up with them. His conversation with them was proximate to their undertaking the work. Had he told them not to go up until the bin was emptied, I am satisfied that they would have abided by his direction because they knew him to be a consultant engaged by Wollondilly to advise it on OH&S matters.

135The evidence does not reveal what the qualifications of Mr Blackburn were; how familiar he was with the Penrose site and business; whether he knew of the operation of the shavings bin; or, indeed, whether he knew what the structure contained. He had been engaged by Wollondilly in about May 2006 and had attended various toolbox meetings with Wollondilly's workers. 

136I consider it to be just that Wollondilly bear 20% of the total loss Penrose has suffered by the damage to its shavings bin having regard to Mr Blackburn's comparative responsibility (see Mitchell Morgan Nominees Pty Ltd v Vella [2011] NSWCA 390). But for Mr Blackburn's involvement, Wollondilly would have been responsible for 30% of the total property loss, once a deduction for contributory negligence is made.

Assessment of damages on the property cross-claim

137The fundamental measure of damages for tort is the amount of money it will take to put the claimant in the position it would have been in had the tort not occurred. But for Wollondilly's negligence, Penrose would have had a functioning shavings bin. As a result of Wollondilly's negligence, Penrose needed either to repair or replace its shavings bin.

138The relevant principles to be applied in assessing damages are identified in McGregor on Damages (17th ed, 2002) and can be summarised as follows. 

139The usual measure of damages is the amount by which the goods damaged has been diminished. Generally, the cost of repair is the correct measure of the claimant's loss. However the cost of repair is appropriate only if, in the circumstances, it is reasonable for the claimant to effect the repair rather than replace the goods. 

140The fact that the repairs or replacement have not yet been executed before the hearing, or will never be executed at all, does not prevent recovery. 

141If, however, the goods have been destroyed rather than merely damaged, the normal measure of damages is the market value of the goods destroyed. Should the replacement cost be more than the market value, the cost is still recoverable if it is reasonable to replace. The following principle, summarised in McGregor on Damages was adopted by the Court of Appeal in Evans v Balog [1976] 1 NSWLR 36 at 40, per Samuels JA, with whom Moffit and Hutley JJA agreed:

""The test which appears to be the appropriate one is the reasonableness of the plaintiffs' desire to reinstate the property; this will be judged in part by the advantages to him of reinstatement in relation to the extra cost to the defendant in having to pay damages for reinstatement rather than damages calculated by the diminution in value of the land.""

142The compensatory purpose of ""making good"" the damage that has been done may be fulfilled by the cost of replacement or repair, as the case may be, subject to the requirement of reasonableness: Gagner Pty Ltd Trading As Indochine Cafe v CanturI Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 413 at [103] - [106], per Campbell JA, Macfarlan JA and Sackville AJA agreeing.

143Consequential losses are also recoverable, including expenses incurred, and, if it is proved, loss of profits caused by damage to, or destruction of, the goods.

144The onus of proving any failure to mitigate loss is on Wollondilly. No evidence has been adduced to discharge that onus.

Proceeds of Penrose's insurance policy

145The evidence reveals that Penrose obtained a payment from its insurer as a result of the damage to the bin, for which it is obliged to account if an award of damages is made referable to that damage. Penrose did not use the proceeds of its insurance claim to replace the bin because it required the money for its ongoing operations. The amount of the payout is not relevant to these proceedings since it presumably reflects the terms of the policy rather than the common law measure of damages.

Cost of repair and replacement

146Penrose has established that many of the components that comprised the shavings bin were damaged by the fire to the extent that they need to be replaced. Aistrope Engineers advised Penrose as to which components could be retained and which needed to be replaced. Its report dated 2 October 2007 contains the following summary:

""In summary the major frame, most rolled steel girts, beams and wall bracing may be retained but those girts deformed by heat, all cold rolled girts, the roof structure and all roofing and wall cladding must be replaced to restore the facility to a safe usable condition. The hopper doors require repair and new linings must be fitted.""

147The evidence establishes that the cost of Penrose replacing the shavings bin and repairing components will be as follows:





Demolishing damaged shavings bin
Supply & install replacement bin
Dust filters
Bin Lining
Air cannons
Subtotal

$27,200
$101,750
$48,375
$41,023
$12,190
$230,538

148I am satisfied that these amounts ought be included in the damages in the cross-claim.

Consequential losses

149In 2007, Penrose constructed a 3-sided temporary bin from concrete blocks resting on the ground when the fire damage rendered the existing shavings bin unusable. Penrose continues to use the temporary bin, which is open on the fourth side, although it is not as useful as the damaged bin since the shavings stored there must be removed by front-end loaders, rather than dropping into a truck as occurred with the damaged shavings bin.

150It engaged engineers to investigate and ascertain the extent of the damage to the shavings bin and the need for remedial work.

151In November 2007, Penrose engaged Mr Davenport to make the wiring and power supply to the damaged shavings bin safe.

152It also erected fencing around the damaged shavings bin, as required by WorkCover, and as a safety precaution.

153I am satisfied that Penrose incurred the following expenses prior to 1 November 2007 and that it is entitled to be compensated by Wollondilly for these amounts in the percentage for which I have found it to be liable since they are consequential on Wollondilly's negligence.





Costs incurred
- Temporary Shavings bin
- Engineering Fees
- Temporary fencing
- Make safe work
Subtotal

 
$26,975.26 
$2,690.55 
$685.95 
$1,470.00 
$31,821.76 

154Penrose is entitled to interest on the sum of those amounts at the Court rate interest rate for judgments.

Summmary

155For the foregoing reasons, the short answers to the issues raised at the outset are:

(1) Is Penrose liable to the plaintiff in damages for negligence by reference to the Civil Liability Act 2002 (the Act)? Yes.

(2) If so, to what extent, if at all, are the plaintiff's damages to be reduced by reference to s 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 by reason of any negligence by Sydney Training? 30%

(3) Is Wollondilly liable to Penrose on its claim for contribution under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946? Yes; their responsibility for the plaintiff's loss is 40% Penrose and 60% Wollondilly.

(4) Is Wollondilly liable to Penrose on its claim for property damage? Yes.

(5) If so, to what extent should such damages be reduced by reason of any contributory negligence by Penrose? There should be a 70% reduction.

(6) If so, is Greg Blackburn a concurrent wrongdoer within the meaning of Part 4 of the Act? Yes.

(7) If so, to what extent, if at all, should Wollondilly's liability to Penrose under the claim for property damage be reduced? It is just that Wollondilly ought bear 20% of Penrose's property damage having regard to Mr Blackburn's responsibility for the loss.

(8) The quantum of the plaintiff's claim; Penrose's cross-claim for contribution and Penrose's claim for property damage.

Orders

156The orders I make are:

(1) Judgment for the plaintiff against the second defendant.

(2) Judgment for the second defendant/ cross-claimant on the cross-claim.

(3) I direct the parties to deliver to my Associate within seven days short minutes of order which reflect the judgment sums calculated by reference to my reasons.

2759419,R v Page (No 3) [2012] NSWDC 309,"Judgment

1I re-open the sentence proceedings of Harley Page. I have heard from both parties. I amend the sentencing order which I made on 25 May 2012. The 4 year prison sentence is to commence on 29 August 2011 and to expire on 28 August 2015. The non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months will commence on 29 August 2011 and expire on 28 February 2014. The balance of the term of 18 months will commence on 29 February 2014 and expire on 28 August 2015.

2Mr Harley Page, I think Ms Wasley probably explained to you that there were some days which you ought not to have been credited. But there was one day that turned up that you should have got credit for. So your sentence has commenced 3 days later. Instead of 26 August it commenced 29 August. The non-parole period commences on the same day. Your non-parole period, which is the first day that you will be eligible for release depending on the Parole Authority, will be 28 February 2014. Your overall sentence expires on 28 August 2015. 

HIS HONOUR: Do you understand?
OFFENDER: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Page can be taken down, thank you very much.

2759423,R v Burgess [2012] NSWDC 166,"Sentence

1HIS HONOUR: Christopher Burgess comes before this court in terribly sad circumstances. He is a member of the police force, although currently under suspension as a result of a number of matters, including the offence that brings him before the court today.

2He has pleaded guilty to stealing a firearm under s 154D(1) of the Crimes Act and asks that when I sentence him for that matter I take into account an offence of discharging a firearm in a public place.

3The offender committed those offences in July last year. Before that he had attempted self harm in May. Police intervened and the offender was scheduled into a mental health care facility by a police officer. He had received an authority to return to duty as a police officer in a restricted capacity.

4On 14 July last year the offender went to the police station where he had been working, gained access, through a number of means, to a firearm, a police issue Glock pistol. He also obtained access to ammunition to use with that pistol. He did this by getting keys and ultimately by using a pair of bolt cutters that he had taken from the police station's tactical equipment cupboard. Thereafter he sent a number of messages making it clear that he was intending to kill himself. He left the police station with another officer's pistol and ammunition. 

5As a result of what had occurred a large scale emergency response was initiated. He was located in a public lookout in a State Forest. He was seen to be in possession of the pistol and drinking out of a bottle of Bourbon. 

6Over the next fairly lengthy time he did a number of things to indicate that he was going to shoot himself with the pistol and twice discharged the firearm, once towards the valley and once into the air.

7Negotiations continued for some hours. The offender would continue to drink from the bottle of Bourbon, put the firearm to his head and wander around getting more intoxicated as he did so. At one stage he walked towards where the police were, the police called upon him to surrender the firearm, he said ""I won't shoot youse, I want Kristy."" He then returned back to his vehicle.

8Finally the offender went and sat on the edge of a cliff. He drank the last of the Bourbon, smoked a cigarette and sat down. He then laid down on a rock. Calls from police negotiators failed to generate any response. It appeared that Mr Burgess had lost consciousness or fallen asleep.

9The police then approached him using safety lines and he was taken into custody. The pistol was recovered, nine rounds were observed within the pistol, eight in the magazine and one in the breech.

10He was taken to Maitland Hospital where he was medically assessed and scheduled pursuant to the Mental Health Act.

11The offender's psychiatric troubles that day arise from a number of circumstances. Some of those, indeed perhaps the most important, arise from his work as a police officer. As is unfortunately the case police officers see terrible things in the course of their work. Mr Burgess was no exception. Some police officers remain unaffected by the awful things they see, but Mr Burgess was not one of those. He felt deeply the consequences of seeing things such as death and trauma. He was called to the scene of an incident where he found the body of a dead friend who had had a stroke. He was called to an incident where the person had been struck by a train. And there were other matters of that kind.

12The report of Dr Allnutt tendered to me today which was not in any way challenged by the Crown, indicated that at the time that Mr Burgess committed these offences he was experiencing active symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and major depression. Dr Allnutt said his marital relationship had broken up, he become increasingly suicidal to the extent that it prompted committal to a psychiatric hospital and following his discharge from the hospital his wife broke up with him which probably aggravated his mental state.

13Dr Allnutt even questioned whether Mr Burgess would have available to him a defence of mental illness. By his plea of guilty, Mr Burgess accepts that he has committed the offence despite Dr Allnutt's suggestion.

14It is clearly apparent that the offender intended to harm only himself. This was not a case where he threatened any police officer with the firearm. Indeed on one occasion when he approached them he told them that he did not intend to harm them, although, of course, police who attended the scene would necessarily have concerns for their own safety given Mr Burgess' behaviour and mental state. There is nothing at all to suggest that Mr Burgess had any intention to harm anyone apart from himself that terrible day.

15As might be expected, given his profession, he is a man of prior good character. I understand that he remains as a police officer but is not serving and that he continues to receive psychiatric treatment for his condition.

16This case has many similar features to a decision of R v Paris [2001] NSWCCA 83. Mr Paris also was a person who wished to harm himself and police in that case, as in this case, intervened to prevent that happening. There are some differences and I will get to those, but the important point to note is that on a Crown appeal Mr Paris received a suspended sentence of imprisonment. He had originally got a s 10 from the late Goldring J, but that was overturned on appeal.

17But of course no two cases are identical and it is wrong to think that the case of Paris alone provides a tariff which is appropriate in this case. But because of the similarities between that matter and the present, I have regarded it as particularly helpful in determining the appropriate outcome in this case. 

18In contrast to the case of Paris this offender, as I have repeatedly said made no threats against police officers nor, again in contrast to the case of Mr Paris, did he have any previous criminal history.

19Looking at this matter purely on an objective basis, it is, of course, a very serious matter. To steal a firearm and to then discharge it twice is a matter of great concern. But it must be remembered that the offender's motive in stealing the firearm was not to use it in any crime and not to use it to harm anyone apart from himself. It must also be remembered that his moral culpability at the time of this offence was very low indeed. To say that his thinking was disordered is something of an understatement.

20I should note that the offender's plea of guilty was entered at an early stage. I will not specify the discount that I will grant for that early plea and the utilitarian benefit it brings, but will state that it is one of a number of factors which has led to me imposing a sentence of a different form from that I would otherwise have imposed.

21The Crown was right to submit to me that the offence involved an abuse of trust. Mr Burgess could only gain access to the firearm and indeed only gain access to the non public areas of the police station because of his position. It is a situation where we, as a community, place our trust in police officers allowing them to carry firearms and have access to firearms and when that trust is abused, as it has been in the present case, the offences are, of course, made more serious.

22The difference between the Crown and Mr Ramos as to the appropriate outcome of this matter is, in a practical sense, rather narrow. The Crown says that a custodial sentence is required albeit concedes immediately that it would be appropriate to suspend that sentence. Mr Ramos, on the other hand, as his primary submission, making the suggestion that a s 9 bond would be more appropriate.

23As I said, in practical terms there is not a lot of difference as far as Mr Burgess is concerned. In both cases he will be on a bond to be of good behaviour and if he breaches that bond he will be back before me for resentencing. The bond will, of course, be revoked if he commits any further offences. Given the unlikelihood that Mr Burgess will commit any further offences the chances of that happening are rather remote. But that is looking at the matter practically.

24Looking at the matter legally there is a significant difference. A suspended sentence of imprisonment is a sentence of imprisonment which can only be imposed as a sentence of last resort. I am not satisfied that we have reached that stage. I am not satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment is required in all the circumstances. 

25I repeat again, the offender's moral culpability was extremely low. He committed the offence of stealing the firearm only so that he could harm himself. At no stage did he threaten anyone else. In those circumstances I do not consider that a custodial sentence is required

26The offender is convicted, taking into account the form one matter, he is to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a period of two years. 

27The conditions which apply during the term of that bond are; that he is to be of good behaviour, he is to appear before this court if called upon to do so at any time, he is to advise the registrar of this court of any change in his residential address, he is to continue receiving psychiatric treatment from Dr Murray for as long and as often as Dr Murray considers appropriate.

28Mr Burgess I just want to emphasise something to you. As you probably heard me say I do not think it is likely that you are going to commit any further offences but I say this to everyone: if you do commit a further offence you will be back before me, not some other judge, I have a practice that when I give someone a bond to be of good behaviour, if they breach that bond I am the person that deals with that. And I do that because I want to take into account, if there is a breach, the fact that I have given someone an opportunity and if they do not take advantage of that opportunity then I think it says something about their underlying character that I might have got wrong. So you understand all that?

29OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

2759426,JAMAL v R [2012] NSWCCA 198,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J.

2HIDDEN J: The appellant, Saleh Mahmoud Jamal, was alleged to have been one of seven men involved in a drive-by shooting at Lakemba Police Station in the early hours of 1 November 1998. A number of shots were fired at the police station from a slowly moving car. There were at least sixteen shots, and they were later established by ballistics evidence to have been discharged from four, possibly five, different firearms. Five police officers were in the police station at the time. They promptly took cover and, fortunately, none of them was shot.

3Of the seven men, four were alleged to have been in the car from which the shots were fired. The other three, including the appellant, were said to have been parked in cars in the vicinity, ready to assist in the enterprise as required. Two of those men became Crown witnesses, having been granted indemnity from prosecution. It was alleged that the motive for this criminal activity was to discourage police from targeting people of Lebanese descent in the Lakemba area.

4Proceedings resulting from the incident have had a long history, much of which need not be recounted. In 2004 the appellant was put on trial in the District Court with two alleged co-offenders, Michael Kanaan and Wassim El-Assad. That trial could not be completed because the appellant became ill. The jury was discharged and the appellant was released on bail. He absconded, leaving Australia and travelling to Lebanon. He was extradited back to this country about 2½ years later. This course of events will need to be examined more closely when I deal with one of the grounds of appeal.

5Kanaan and El-Assad were later tried again and acquitted. In November 2009, the appellant stood trial alone upon an indictment charging:

(1) Maliciously discharging a firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm (s 33A of the Crimes Act 1900); 

(2) In the alternative, fire a firearm in or near a public place (s 93G(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.

He was found guilty of the first count, and later sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment. He has appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against the sentence. The issue of sentence need not be examined as I am satisfied that the appeal against conviction should be allowed. 

6Four grounds of appeal against conviction were notified. Ground 2, relating to an incident which occurred in the course of the trial, need not be decided. As will be seen, because of other grounds I would quash the conviction on the first count and direct a new trial on the second count only. 

Ground 1 - unreasonable verdict

7It was not the Crown case that the appellant was one of the gunmen. Rather, as I have said, he was alleged to have been in a car parked in the vicinity, some distance from the police station. The case against him was that he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to discharge loaded firearms with intent to do grievous bodily harm to persons in attendance at the police station. At the close of the Crown case, counsel then appearing for the appellant (who did not appear in this court) applied for a directed verdict of acquittal on the first count. The basis of the application was that there was no evidence that the joint criminal enterprise alleged embraced an intention to do grievous bodily harm to any person. That application was refused. 

8The first ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in refusing the application and, in any event, the conviction on the first count is unreasonable. In this court Mr Game SC, who appeared with Mr Barrow for the appellant, did not revisit the application for a directed verdict and was content to argue that the verdict is unreasonable. For this purpose it is necessary to review salient aspects of the evidence in the Crown case.

9The incident occurred at about 1.15am. Lakemba Police Station was a 24 hour station. At the time the exterior lights of the police station were on. So were the interior lights and the interior could be seen from outside through the external doors, which were of plate glass. Police investigating the incident shortly after it occurred found thirteen bullet holes in those doors. They varied in height above ground level, most of them being in an area between about 1.3 metres and 1.6 metres. As I have said, there were several officers in the police station at the time. Plainly enough, firing weapons into the police station at that height carried the risk that someone inside would be shot. 

10The inference was available that those who were firing the weapons, or one or more of them, intended to shoot occupants of the station. However, the appellant was not one of them. An intent to cause grievous bodily harm could be sheeted home to him only if it was part of the joint criminal enterprise to which he was said to be a party. It is necessary to examine the evidence of the planning of the incident, as to which the crucial witnesses were the two men who had been granted indemnity from prosecution. They gave evidence under the pseudonyms of Alan Rossini and Peter Laycock. 

11There were inconsistencies between the accounts of those two witnesses and, of course, their evidence was challenged. However, for the purpose of resolving this ground of appeal I find it unnecessary to consider those inconsistencies or their credibility generally. I am content to summarise their evidence as it emerged favourably for the Crown. 

12A week before the incident there was a meeting at a unit at Surry Hills, at which the appellant, Kanaan, El-Assad and Rossini were present, as well as two other men, Charlie Geagea and Ghassan Said. Whether Laycock was also present is unclear. There was a discussion about what was seen as police harassment of young Lebanese men in Lakemba. Kanaan suggested the drive-by shooting at the police station, an idea which was greeted with enthusiasm by the others present.

13On the night of the shooting the appellant and the other men, including Laycock, met at a convenience store in Croydon Park. It was there that the plan to carry out the shooting was developed. Put shortly, firearms were obtained from the Surry Hills unit, stockings were bought (apparently for the purpose of disguise, although that also is not entirely clear), and a Holden Commodore was stolen. It was that car that was used for the drive-by shooting. A can of petrol was also bought for the purpose of setting fire to the stolen car after the shooting.

14The appellant was a party to this planning. The group returned to the Surry Hills unit to obtain the weapons in two cars, one of which was driven by him. He did not take a firearm but he had a police scanner with an earpiece. They returned to Lakemba. There they assembled (as I understand it) at Said's home, where the weapons were loaded. They then drove in convoy, with El-Assad driving the stolen Commodore, to the back of Wiley Park Primary School. The school was roughly half a kilometre from Lakemba Police Station. 

15The appellant's task was to wait behind the school, listening to the police scanner. He suggested that after the shooting the gunmen should drive the stolen car to a point near where he was waiting, set fire to the vehicle and run to his car. He would then drive them from the scene.

16Rossini and Laycock drove in their car to a street closer to the police station, where they parked. They were to attempt to block off the police in the event of a chase. The appellant remained in his car behind the school. The other four men drove the stolen car to the police station and the shooting took place. I should record that Laycock gave evidence that the appellant was one of the men in the Commodore. However, he had never said that before - not in his statement to police, nor in his evidence at the committal proceedings or in the first trial - and, in any event, it was not the Crown case. 

17The plan was carried out. After the shooting the stolen Commodore was set alight, and all seven men repaired to the Surry Hills unit.

18In the light of this evidence, it was well open to the jury to conclude that the appellant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to conduct a drive-by shooting at the police station. However, whether an intent to do grievous bodily harm to any person was a feature of that enterprise depends on the evidence of what was discussed before the incident took place. I have referred to Kanaan's suggestion at the meeting the week before the incident of a drive-by shooting at the police station in response to perceived police harassment. This was the evidence of Rossini. Rossini also gave evidence that, when the group met at the convenience store on the night of the shooting, Kanaan said, ""We're going to do the drive-by shooting at Lakemba Police Station. Go to Surry Hills and pick up some artillery."" According to Laycock, at the convenience store the appellant said that it had been ""hot"" in that area, and they wanted to do something ""to cause a bit of havoc."" 

19That was the extent of the evidence about what was intended to be achieved by the shooting. Obviously, it was possible to shoot at the police station in such a way as to intimidate any occupants without wounding them. Indeed, in cross examination Rossini gave this evidence:

Q. At the first meeting there was just a general discussion, that's the meeting a week before the 31st, and you said there were no real plans made, is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. And the first you heard of the shooting on the evening of the 31st, morning of 1 November 1998 was when you arrived at the 7-Eleven, is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And that was, you understood, an agreement to go and shoot at the police station?
A. Yes, that's right. 
Q. And that was an agreement to shoot the police station building, wasn't it?
A. Yes.
Q. It wasn't an agreement to shoot policemen, was it?
A. My understanding, no.

20It appears to me that the evidence of discussions at both meetings could establish no more than an intention to shoot at the police station for the purpose of intimidation, and falls well short of establishing an intention that any police officer be shot. Nor can such an inference be drawn from the behaviour of the men when they returned to the Surry Hills unit after the shooting. Rossini's evidence was that everyone was excited, laughing, making high fives and saying things like, ""The cops are shitting themselves"". Kanaan said, ""The cops will think twice about targeting Lebs and Bankstown Station is the next"". El-Assad said, ""Fuck all the coppers, see that copper shit himself and go to the ground"". Nothing in these remarks conveys a plan to cause grievous bodily harm to any officer. Indeed, they are consistent with an intimidatory motive. What was conceived was a protest, albeit one which was highly dangerous and utterly reprehensible. 

21I should refer to the evidence of two other witnesses, both of whom also gave evidence under pseudonyms. This evidence was also challenged but, for present purposes, I would accept it at face value. The first of them, giving evidence under the name Dennis Green, gave evidence that, a day or so before the shooting, he went to the Surry Hills unit. There he saw Kaanan, El-Assad, Rossini, Said and the Appellant. They were cleaning guns and the Appellant was holding a revolver. Kaanan whispered to Green, ""You know Lakemba Police Station?"" Green said that he did and then Kaanan made a gesture as if pointing a gun. Green said that they were ""sick cunts"". This incident adds nothing to the evidence to which I have already referred. 

22The other witness, giving evidence under the name of Roy Kennedy, was employed in early 1999 in a panel beating business of which the appellant was a part owner. Some months after he had been working there, he had a conversation with the appellant about the shooting. The appellant laughed and said he had done it ""to get the coppers off his back, to stop from hassling him"". The topic came up in conversation on several further occasions and, at times when Kennedy was late for work, the appellant would say words to the effect, ""Just remember what I am capable of. I done Lakemba"". This evidence also takes the matter no further.

23As I have said, the inference that one or more of the men in the stolen car intended to shoot occupants of the police station could be drawn from the manner in which the shooting was carried out. Certainly, their behaviour was reckless. However, the appellant was not privy to what was occurring at the police station. He was the best part of half a kilometre away. Nothing that was said in planning the incident conveys that the plan embraced the infliction of grievous bodily harm on any person. Nor could that inference fairly be drawn from the whole of the circumstances. 

24The Crown case was not based upon extended joint criminal enterprise, that is, the contemplation by the appellant of one of the gunmen firing with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in the course of another crime (such as the offence the subject of the second count, firing a firearm in or near a public place). He knew that the men who were to do the shooting had four loaded firearms, and it would be surprising if he were not aware of the risk that someone might be shot. However, it is quite another matter to find that he participated in an enterprise in which the infliction of grievous bodily harm was intended. In my view, the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about that issue. I would quash the conviction on the first count and enter a verdict of acquittal. 

25It would be open to this court to substitute a verdict of guilty of the alternative count, firing a firearm in or near a public place, pursuant to s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Mr Game opposed that course, submitting that there should be a new trial of that count. I agree. The appellant's case was that he was not involved in the incident at all, and the evidence that he was emanated mainly from Rossini and Laycock. As I have said, their evidence was challenged and their credibility impugned, and it would be appropriate that proof of that count be assessed at a new trial. Moreover, there was a fundamental defect in the trial which is the subject of ground 3, to which I now turn. 

Ground 3 - The View

26In the course of the hearing of pre-trial issues, the Crown made an application for a view, that is, an inspection under s 53 of the Evidence Act 1995, of the scene of the shooting. This was opposed by defence counsel on the basis, firstly, that it would be of no real benefit to the jury and, secondly, that at such a view the appellant would be shackled and subject to high levels of security. The appellant was in custody at the time and, for reasons which need not concern us, was classified as an ""extreme high risk"" inmate. Nevertheless, defence counsel told her Honour that, if there was to be a view, the appellant wished to be there and pointed out that he was entitled to be present. The Crown prosecutor said that the appellant would be able to attend and would be held inside a car outside the police station. The police station itself was cramped and, while the jury was inside, the trial judge and the lawyers would remain outside. He confirmed that nothing would be said to the jury during the view. 

27Evidence was subsequently led by a senior police officer that if the appellant attended the view, he would be held within a cage in a secure Corrective Services vehicle. That vehicle would have tinted windows, but the appellant would be visible from outside on a closer viewing. He would be wearing orange overalls and a restraining belt, to which would be attached shackles to his hands and feet. In these circumstances, the trial judge decided that the view should take place in his absence and that there would be no need for him to be there. She observed that he would be represented by his counsel, and that the jury would simply make observations without anything being said by anyone.

28Trial counsel for the appellant initially responded by saying ""I'm not going to cavil with that."" However, he put on record that he had ""very firm instructions"" from the appellant that he wanted to attend. Her Honour repeated her view that there was no necessity for him to be there because he would be represented by counsel. She added that she took into account the question of whether the parties would be present, as required by s 53(3) of the Evidence Act, but affirmed her decision that there was ""no necessity for the accused to be present because he will be represented by counsel."" Accordingly, during the trial the view took place in the appellant's absence. Ground 3 complains that her Honour fell into error in ordering the view. 

29Relevantly, s 53 of the Evidence Act provides:

(1) A judge may, on application, order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held.

(2) A judge is not to make an order unless he or she is satisfied that:
(a) the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and
(b) the judge and, if there is a jury, the jury will be present.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following:
(a) whether the parties will be present,
(b) whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection will, in the court's opinion, assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence,
(c) the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time,
(d) in the case of a demonstration - the extent to which the demonstration will properly reproduce the conduct or event to be demonstrated,
(e) in the case of an inspection - the extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered.
...

30From the terms of subs (2)(a), it is apparent that the appellant had a right to be present at the view. A reasonable opportunity for the parties to be present is a essential requirement for a view to be directed. Both the requirements of subs (2) were described as ""mandatory"" by Pepper J in Environment Protection Authority v Unomedical Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] NSWLEC 111 at [7]. Her Honour appears to have seen the question whether the appellant would be present at the view simply as one of the matters to be taken into account under subs (3)(a). That provision, however, does not affect the mandatory prerequisite of subs (2)(a). 

31Of course, what subs (2)(a) requires is a reasonable opportunity for the parties to be present. A party may choose not to be. Early in the life of the Evidence Act, Hunt CJ at CL confirmed that in a criminal trial an accused may elect not to attend: R v Milat (Hunt CJ at CL, unreported 12 April 1996). The Chief Judge, sitting as a trial judge, was considering whether a view should be held, having been informed that the accused did not wished to be present at it. 

32His Honour saw the accused's stance as a matter to be taken into account under subs (3)(a). He noted that, unlike the common law position, what happens on a view now constitutes evidence because of the provision in s 54 that a jury may draw any reasonable inference from what they see, hear or otherwise notice during it (at p 2). However, in determining that the view should proceed, one of matters he took into account was that it was intended ""to be no more than inspection of a static site"". There was not to be any demonstration, and he concluded that there was ""no real danger that the absence of the accused is likely to lead to that evidence being misused"". He noted that the avoidance of that danger was said by the Law Reform Commission to be the reason for the requirement in subs (3)(a) that consideration be given to whether the parties would be present (at p 3). 

33As I have said, in the present case her Honour was told that the jury would simply inspect the police station without anything being said and, clearly, nothing in the nature of a demonstration was contemplated. Moreover, her Honour was understandably concerned about the prejudice which the appellant might suffer if he was seen by the jury restrained in the manner which his high security status required. The fact remains that, unlike the accused in Milat, he had made it clear that he wished nonetheless to be present. 

34Of course, influential in her Honour's decision was the fact that the appellant's counsel would be at the view. No doubt, where an accused elects not to attend a view, the fact that his or her counsel would be in attendance would be an important factor in exercising the discretion under subs (3). On the other hand, the reference in subs (2)(a) to ""the parties"" is clearly to the parties themselves, and the right conferred upon them by that provision is not honoured by extending a reasonable opportunity merely to their legal representatives to be present. So much was recognised in Chotiputhsilpa v Waterhouse & Ors [2005] NSWCA 295. That was a motor vehicle personal injury case, in which one of the respondents asked the Court of Appeal to conduct a view of the accident scene. That application was opposed by the appellant (the plaintiff). The court considered the factors in subs (3), and one of the reasons for its refusal of the application was that the appellant would not be present as he had returned to his native Thailand: per Beazley JA, with whom Giles and Ipp JJA agreed at [86] - [89]. 

35The entitlement under subs (2)(a) of an accused to be present at a view is, of course, consistent with longstanding authority affirming that, generally speaking, an accused should be present at every stage of a criminal trial. In Lawrence v The King [1933] AC 699, Lord Atkin, giving the opinion of the Privy Council, said at 708: 

""It is an essential principle of our criminal law that the trial for an indictable offence has to be conducted in the presence of the accused: and for this purpose trial means the whole of the proceedings, including sentence.""

(His Lordship went on to acknowledge an exception in cases of misdemeanour, as opposed to felony, but that distinction has passed into history.)

36Subsequent authority has recognised that an accused's own behaviour may provide an exception to that apparently uncompromising statement of principle. In R v McHardie & Danielson [1983] 2 NSWLR 733, one of the respondents absconded from custody while the trial was in progress. The Court of Criminal Appeal (Begg, Lee and Cantor JJ) recognised the discretion of the trial judge in such a case to continue the trial in the accused's absence. The court said (at 739): 

""The accused person has no 'right' to be absent from his trial - subject to cases of necessity (such as illness, where the interests of fairness and justice may require the trial either to be delayed or discontinued). Conversely, the accused person has a right to be present at his trial, subject to his conduct. It seems clearly established by authorities (as it is by commonsense) that if the accused person behaves intentionally to make the continuation of the trial impossible, and if such conduct is found by the trial judge to have that effect, he may be removed from the court...

After a great deal of consideration..., we have reached the conclusion that an accused person cannot be heard to say that he has been denied his right to be present at his trial when he voluntarily abandons that right...by escaping from lawful custody in prison, and thus failing to appear at the continuation of his trial.""

37Their Honours considered authority on the question at 740-745, concluding (at 745) with an affirmation of ""the general principle that at an indictable offence trial before a judge and jury the accused's presence is normally a pre-requisite to a fair trial,"" but adding that the failure of an accused to appear at trial after it has started through escape from lawful custody could correctly be described as ""a waiver of his right to be present at his trial"", leaving the trial judge with the discretion whether to continue the trial or discharge the jury. 

38I should note that Hunt CJ at CL, presiding in the Court of Criminal Appeal, examined Lawrence and McHardie & Danielson in R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67, at 71-2. It is not necessary to refer to what his Honour there said. In that case it was held that a Crown appeal against sentence could be heard in the absence of the respondent, and sentence passed upon him, because he had deliberately left the country to avoid the consequences of a successful appeal. That position has since been put beyond doubt by the insertion of s 14A into the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

39In the passage from McHardie & Danielson quoted above, the court recognised the power of the trial judge to remove an accused from the court if he or she intentionally behaves in such a way as to make the continuation of the trial impossible. Such a case was Eastman v R (1997) 158 ALR 107, in which the full Federal Court upheld the decision of the trial judge to remove the accused to a separate room with a video facility because of his persistent disruptive behaviour in the courtroom. The court said (at 138): 

""The right of an accused to be present on his or her trial to hear the evidence and confront his or her accuser, while a paramount consideration, is not without qualification and the means by which it is exercised is subject to the control of the trial judge.""

Their Honours referred to the passage in McHardie & Danielson which I have quoted, as well as to a passage affirming the same principle in R v Vernell [1953] VLR 590. 

40In Milat (at p 3), Hunt CJ at CL said:

""The voluntary absence of the accused certainly does not render the evidence created by the view inadmissible. Moreover, although what happens on a view now constitutes evidence, it remains sufficiently distinct from the trial itself as not to require... the presence of the accused at that view in order for the trial to be effective.""

Again, of course, these observations flowed from the choice of that accused not to attend the view. 

41In this court, the Crown prosecutor focused on the discretion conferred by s 53(3) and submitted that, given the manner in which the view was conducted and the fact that the appellant's counsel was present, there had been no miscarriage of justice. The fact remains, however, that the view took place in the absence of the appellant, contrary to the mandatory requirement of subs (2)(a). It was not suggested that the level of security required by the appellant's high risk status bore on the question whether there could be a ""reasonable opportunity"" for him to be present, within the meaning of that provision. In my opinion, his absence from the view means that the trial was fundamentally flawed. Indeed, in oral argument the Crown prosecutor acknowledged that if the court found this ground established, the trial could not ""be saved."" 

42In large part, the appellant's written submissions on this ground were directed to whether the conviction could be sustained by the application of the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Of course, there could be no question of the application of the proviso because I have found that ground 1 is made out and the conviction of the first count must be set aside. However, guidance is to be found in authority on whether the proviso can be applied when there has been a fundamental defect in the conduct of a trial.

43In Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52, 236 CLR 358, French CJ said at [87] that there is ""support for the proposition that a failure of the judicial process may be so fundamental as to result in a trial which is incurably flawed."" The Chief Justice referred to the judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Katsuno v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 40, in which their Honours referred to Maher v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 221 and Johns (Roger) v The Queen (1979) 141 CLR 409. In both of those cases convictions were set aside because of significant procedural defects in the trial. In Johns, counsel for the accused had withdrawn a challenge to a prospective juror made by his client without instructions to do so. In Maher, the Crown was allowed to add two counts to an indictment after the accused had pleaded not guilty to the indictment in its original form and the jury had been empanelled.

44In Katsuno, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan said at [35]:

""At one level, the decisions in Maher and Johns are concerned with failure to comply with mandatory legislative provisions relating to the constitution and authority of the jury. At another, as is clear from the judgment of the court in Maher, they are concerned with 'failure to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect', of which the failure to observe mandatory provisions relating to the constitution and authority of the jury is but an example. A conviction simply cannot stand if the trial process is flawed in a fundamental respect."" (Footnotes omitted.)

45In Cesan the Chief Justice, after citing that passage, continued at [88] - [89]:

""[88] If there be a flaw in a fundamental respect such that the appearance of injustice is indelibly stamped on the process and its outcome from the point of view of a reasonable and informed observer, this may be expressed by saying that public confidence would be undermined if the conviction were allowed to stand.

[89] A trial process 'flawed in a fundamental respect' falls into that category. Such deficiencies in process constitute miscarriages of justice. ...""

46The conduct of a view in breach of the statutory requirement to provide the accused with a reasonable opportunity to be present constitutes a fundamental flaw in the trial process. This ground is made out and, standing alone, would be sufficient to establish that the conviction must be set aside. However, as there is to be a new trial, it is necessary to consider the remaining ground of appeal which is directed to evidence of a consciousness of guilt. 

Ground 4 - flight

47As I have said, the appellant absconded on bail, travelling to Lebanon, after the first trial in 2004 had been aborted because of his illness. At that stage of the trial Mr Rossini was giving evidence. He had been cross-examined by counsel for the two co-accused and was still under cross- examination by counsel for the appellant. The trial was aborted on 11 March 2004, and on the following day was re-listed for hearing on 18 October of that year.

48On 22 March 2004, the appellant made an urgent application for a passport in a false name. The passport was issued on the following day, and on the same day he boarded a flight for Lebanon. CCTV photographs at the airport revealed that he had changed his appearance by having his hair cut shorter and shaving off his beard. 

49He arrived in Lebanon on 24 March 2004. On 8 May, he was arrested by authorities in that country in relation to other matters. In June 2006 Lebanese authorities authorised his extradition to Australia. On 26 September 2006, he was taken in custody by New South Wales Police and arrived back in Sydney two days later.

50After taking evidence on the voir dire, her Honour allowed evidence of the appellant's flight as material capable of establishing a consciousness of guilt. The evidence had been objected to, primarily on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the appellant: s 137 of the Evidence Act. Ground 4 asserts that the evidence should not have been admitted.

51Evidence on this issue was given on the voir dire. The appellant gave evidence, in which he denied that he had left Australia because of the charges relating to the Lakemba shooting. He revealed that he had also been charged with two other shootings, but he did not advance those charges as a reason for absconding. He said that his primary reason for leaving the country was that he was under pressure from government agencies over suspicions that he was involved in terrorism. He had been released on bail in respect of the present charges and the other shooting charges in 2001, and he described a number of incidents thereafter which conveyed to him that he was under scrutiny by state and federal police and by ASIO for his suspected involvement in the planning of terrorist attacks in Australia. He denied that he was involved in anything of the kind.

52A journalist, Mr Martin Chulov, also gave evidence on the voir dire. In 2005, he was the Middle-East correspondent for ""The Australian"" newspaper. He interviewed the appellant while he was in custody in Lebanon. He said that there had been a number of reports in Australian newspapers throughout 2005 linking the appellant to potential terrorist activities, and that he wanted ""to explore whether there was any veracity to them."" Put shortly, the appellant confirmed that he had been under suspicion for terrorist activity, saying that the Australian government ""has been chasing me for three years."" 

53However, according to Mr Chulov, he also said that he wanted to leave Australia because ""there was a lot of heat over Lakemba"" and that he wanted ""some breathing space."" He also said that he didn't want to go back during the trial, adding that ""they wanted to nail me for it."" Mr Chulov knew about the drive-by shooting at the police station, and deduced that that was what the appellant was talking about. Importantly, in his evidence in the trial (that is, in the presence of the jury) it was put to him that the appellant said that he ""didn't do the Lakemba Police Station shooting."" He said that he believed that to be the case. He also said that the appellant told him ""that he didn't want to face trial for that matter and that he had left Australia to avoid any heat from security officials."" 

54Trial counsel for the appellant argued that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial because, to rebut the inference that he had absconded because of a consciousness of guilt of the crimes charged, he would have no choice but to reveal that he was a suspected terrorist. However, her Honour assessed the probative value of the evidence as ""very high"", noting his arrangements to travel to Lebanon soon after the trial was aborted and re-listed, and the circumstances in which he departed from Australia. Her Honour also noted the stage the trial had reached at the time it was aborted, that is, while Mr Rossini, whom she described as ""a very important Crown witness"", was giving evidence of the accused's involvement in the offence. She also had regard, of course, to the evidence of Mr Chulov tending to connect the appellant's departure with the Lakemba shooting.

55Her Honour observed that the usual directions would be given to the jury concerning evidence said to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt. She added that if the appellant chose to meet the evidence by reference to the material which was prejudicial to him, that could be dealt with by appropriate directions. In the course of her reasons her Honour had regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52. 

56One of the issues in Cook was whether evidence of flight had been wrongly admitted. The court determined that it had. It is unnecessary to examine the facts of that case which, on this issue, were very different from the present case. Its relevance is that in that case the explanation which the appellant would have advanced to explain evidence of flight would have revealed criminal conduct other than that with which he was charged. Objection had been taken to the evidence on the basis of s 137 of the Evidence Act.

57Delivering the leading judgment, Simpson J characterised the probative value of the evidence to the Crown case as ""very high indeed"": at [36]. However, at [37] her Honour added: ""The balancing exercise required by s 137 cannot, however, be undertaken without an appreciation of any explanation an accused person might seek to advance in order to nullify the adverse inferences that would, absent explanation, arise."" In the event, her Honour concluded that the evidence should have been rejected because the appellant's response to it ""not only disclosed previous criminal offences, it disclosed criminal offences with a disturbingly close relationship to the offence with which he was charged"": [48].

58I would not lightly question the judgment of the very experienced trial judge in the present case. However, it does not appear to me that the probative value of the evidence was as high as her Honour assessed it. This was an unusual case. The appellant's flight was very late in the piece. He had been on bail between 2001 and 2004, when he appeared for his trial. Insofar as his departure from Australia was attributable to the present charges, the evidence appears to me to be as consistent with a fear of wrongful conviction as it was with a consciousness of guilt. 

59The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. To deal with the evidence of his flight he would have to have done so, and would have to have revealed that he was suspected of involvement in terrorist activity. No doubt, he would have denied any such involvement and, of course, appropriate directions would have been given about that evidence. Nevertheless, it appears to me that the probative value of the evidence of flight was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the appellant and it should not have been admitted. Of course, I say so in the light of the evidence that was before her Honour. At a retrial it would be a matter for the trial judge to determine the admissibility of the evidence on the material presented at that trial.

Orders

60Accordingly, I would quash the conviction and sentence on the first count and enter a verdict and judgment of acquittal on that count. I would order a new trial of the second count.

61ROTHMAN J: I agree with Hidden J.

62The argument for unreasonable verdict does not depend upon the credibility of evidence, but the existence of an hypothesis inconsistent with guilt for the offence charged by the Crown. I have read the evidence and agree that such an hypothesis exists.

63I also agree, for the reasons given by Hidden J, that the appropriate order is a new trial on the second count and not a substituted verdict.

2759430,SHARP v R [2012] NSWCCA 134,"Judgment

1WHEALY JA: I agree with Hidden J and the order he proposes.

2HIDDEN J: The appellant, Nicholas Stafford Sharp, was tried in the District Court with two other men, Lee Frederick Funnell and Dean William Phelps, for offences arising out of an incident which took place at Byron Bay on 7 March 2009. The appellant was charged with causing grievous bodily harm to Dallas Arnold with intent to do so (s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900) and with affray. He was found guilty of the first of those offences but acquitted of the second. He appeals against his conviction of that first count.

3The only issue on that count was whether the intent to cause grievous bodily harm was established. Indeed, when arraigned on that count, the appellant pleaded not guilty but guilty of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm (s 35 of the Crimes Act). The Crown prosecutor did not accept that plea in satisfaction of the count.

4The appellant contends that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable, and that the trial judge failed properly to direct the jury about the element of intent. Given the limited issue that was in contest, a brief summary of the evidence at the trial will suffice. The basis of the charges against Mr Funnell and Mr Phelps has no bearing upon the appeal, and need not be considered.

The evidence

5In the evening of 7 March 2009, the appellant was at the Beach Hotel at Byron Bay with his girlfriend, Lauren Newman, Mr Funnell and Mr Phelps. The victim of the offence, Mr Arnold, was also at the hotel with some companions, including Nathan Spratt. There was an incident involving members of the two groups. It appears that something inappropriate was said about Ms Newman, and there was a physical altercation involving Mr Arnold, Mr Spratt and Mr Funnell. Exactly what happened is not clear, but nothing turns on it for present purposes. Whatever it was, it seems that the appellant did not see it but was told about it.

6Some time later, the appellant, Mr Funnell and Mr Phelps were approaching the Great Northern Hotel. They saw Mr Arnold and Mr Spratt outside the hotel and approached them. What then happened appears to have sprung from the appellant's belief that Mr Arnold had been involved in the earlier incident and, in particular, had made the remark about Ms Newman. He approached Mr Arnold and punched him to the head. He delivered further punches to the head and Mr Arnold slumped towards the ground. Mr Arnold tried to get back up on his feet, holding onto the door of the hotel. The appellant pulled him away and threw him to the ground. Again he tried to get up but the appellant held him down, continuing to punch him and kneeing him. Mr Arnold managed to get to his feet and stumbled away from the appellant, but the appellant delivered more punches and pulled him along the ground. Mr Arnold fell to the ground and the appellant stomped on his head.

7What I have described is the effect of what can be seen on CCTV footage which was in evidence, together with the accounts of a number of eye-witnesses. Some of the witnesses described the appellant kicking Mr Arnold while he was on the ground, but that is not apparent from the CCTV footage. Some of the witnesses also said that at one stage Mr Arnold attempted to punch the appellant or, at least, shaped up to him, but that also cannot be seen on the footage. 

8More importantly, the stomping on Mr Arnold's head emerges only from the eye-witness evidence because the two men were out of the range of the CCTV cameras at that point. Several of the witnesses heard the appellant say something about his girlfriend at the time of the stomping action. In particular, one witness said that immediately after the stomp the appellant said something like, ""Don't come near me or my girlfriend"", while another said that immediately before the stomp he said something like, ""Don't talk to my missus like that."" Before his head was stomped on several of the witnesses said that he appeared to be unconscious, and one observed him to be bleeding from the head.

9As will be seen, the eye-witness evidence about the stomping is important to the issues in the appeal. Six eye-witnesses said that the stomp was to the left side of Mr Arnold's head, variously described as being to the area of the temple or to the back or side of the head in the area of the left ear. Another witness agreed in cross-examination that it ""could have been"" near the left eye, adding that he thought that ""it was in the face region."" Four witnesses described the stomp as being to the top or side of the head, without specifying whether it was towards the left or the right. One witness described it as being to the centre of the head. 

10Mr Arnold suffered a significant brain injury as a result of the incident and had no recollection of it. Medical evidence established that he had sustained a left-sided maxillary fracture which was minimally displaced. More importantly, he had also sustained a right temporal skull fracture which extended through to the tempora mandibular joint on that side. This was the major injury, and it was not in dispute that it amounted to grievous bodily harm. A doctor who examined Mr Arnold when he was taken to the emergency department at Byron Bay Hospital was of the opinion that his injuries ""were not inconsistent with his head suffering a severe blunt force trauma while lying on a hard surface."" 

11The causation of the injuries was examined more closely by Dr Richard Byron Collins, a forensic pathologist who was called in the defence case. He did not see Mr Arnold but he had access to the medical records. He agreed that the injuries were the result of blunt force trauma, noting that there were two areas of impact. The left-sided maxillary fracture, he said, was consistent with a punch. The focus of his evidence was the right-sided skull fracture, leading to a contrecoup injury to the brain on the left side. The effect of his evidence was that these injuries would have been the product of an impact to the right side of the head. They could have been caused by a blow to that side of the head or by Mr Arnold having struck his head on that side when he fell to the ground. They would also be consistent with a stomp to the right side of the head, but he noted that that was not the evidence of any of the witnesses. 

12Asked in cross-examination whether they could have been caused by the right side of the head coming into contact with the ground through force being applied to the left side, he said that they could ""in general terms"" but was of the view that that was not the case in this instance. If that had occurred, he said, one would expect to see significant damage to the skin or the bony structures underneath it on the left side but, as he understood it, there was no evidence of any injury on that side. In fact, the doctor in the emergency department at the hospital noted ""significant bruising and swelling"" to the left side of Mr Arnold's face. The right side, she noted, was very distorted. She said in evidence that ""his entire face seemed misaligned but the right side was particularly misaligned."" She described the right side as ""stoved in.""

13The appellant gave evidence which it is not necessary to examine in any detail, given the way in which the appeal was argued. It is sufficient to say that he admitted having assaulted Mr Arnold. He acknowledged having been the initial aggressor, but his description of what then ensued amounted to a fight between the two of them in which he did not indulge in the level of violence which the Crown alleged. In particular, he denied having stomped on Mr Arnold's head. He said that the incident ended when Mr Arnold fell to the ground while he was holding onto him. He fell with Mr Arnold and he ""stepped out"" in the process, so that his foot accidentally came into contact with the top of Mr Arnold's head. 

Addresses and Summing-Up

14At the trial the evidence of the stomping loomed large on the question of the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. In discussion after the Crown case closed, the Crown prosecutor (who did not appear in this court) referred to evidence of ""a short break in the assault on Mr Arnold"" before the appellant stomped on his head. She also referred to the evidence of what the appellant said about his girlfriend, and said that ""the Crown's case is that the words that were spoken at the time, the break in the assault that led to Mr Arnold being on the ground during that break or shortly before the stomping, Mr Sharp formed the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm."" At that stage, of course, Dr Collins had not given his evidence. 

15In her final address to the jury the Crown prosecutor continued to place emphasis upon the stomp on the question of the intent. At one point she referred to arguments she had put the previous day and continued:

""What the issue for your consideration is is the intent and yesterday ... the Crown attempted to show you that there were certain actions carried out by Mr Sharp that can only constitute and show that in fact he was intending to do such harm to Mr Arnold. That primarily comes down to the actions that were clearly witnessed by independent witnesses who all say quite vehemently and quite strongly that there was a stomping action."" 

A little later, after taking the jury to part of her cross-examination of the appellant, she referred to his characterisation of the incident as a fight and, in particular, his evidence that he had put Mr Arnold on the ground and kneed him ""because he guessed the fight would be over."" She then said to the jury:

""The fight would be over, ladies and gentlemen, as soon as Mr Arnold was taken unawares and hit to the side of his head as demonstrated in that close-circuit television footage. He did not stand a chance you might think, he was taken by surprise from behind, dragged to the pavement, pummelled and to finish him off he was witnessed by the witnesses that you heard stomping on his head and that is not only dramatic, it clearly demonstrates that this man had an intention to do maximum harm to Mr Arnold."" 

16In the course of the final address of counsel for the appellant at the trial (who also did not appear in this court), there was discussion about whether the Crown should be confined to a case that it was the stomping which caused the grievous bodily harm and that it was at or about that time that the appellant formed the requisite intent. The trial judge ruled that the Crown was not so confined, and that he would direct the jury that it was a matter for them to decide how the serious injury was caused and whether or not the relevant intent had been proved. No complaint is made about that ruling in this court.

17In putting the appellant's case to the jury, trial counsel argued that what occurred before the alleged stomp was a fair fight and, even if the jury were satisfied that a punch had caused the grievous bodily harm, they could not be satisfied that it was accompanied by an intent to cause that level of harm. If they were satisfied that the appellant deliberately stomped on Mr Arnold's head, he argued, they might conclude that he had the requisite intent at that time but could not be satisfied that it was that action which caused the grievous bodily harm. 

18In directing the jury on the question of intent, his Honour had this to say:

""Now what the position here is is first of all, the evidence in general talks about some punching, there may or may not be evidence that satisfies you about kneeing or any more other things and then the Crown in particular has concentrated on what is described as the alleged stomping. The defence in particular, a reliance on Dr Collins have said well, the stomping we say cannot have caused the head injury and the issue they say is well in a single punch, you cannot really say that that would be with the requisite intention.

...

... you are going to have to decide on all the evidence did that arise as the Crown has principally maintained from what they call the stomping, and you have to bear in mind the doctors' evidence about that, Dr Collins who says his view is because there is no particular injury on the left side, it cannot be the stomping, but he said it could well be the punch, that might have caused it.

Now that of course is for you to resolve and decide what you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about because once you have decided the mechanism of how it happened, that will then be the background against which you decide whether the intent has been made out. The Crown as I say have emphasised the stomping in saying coupled with what was being said according to the witnesses if you accepted if there was a stomping that caused that, well that really speaks for itself and makes the intent clear. They did not address you at all about what would be in anybody's mind with a punch that could have cracked somebody's skull in the way described by Dr Olsson so you do not have that assistance.

Mr Harrison on behalf of the accused says it is a bit difficult to see that sort of intent in one punch; that is entirely a matter for you, you decide. If for instance you say, well we are not satisfied the stomp caused the cracked skull, we prefer the view that it was the punch, you then go on to consider against that background whether the intent has been made out."" 

The appeal

19In this court the appellant was represented by Mr Odgers SC, who argued two grounds: firstly, that the verdict was unreasonable and, secondly, that the trial judge failed properly to direct the jury about the alternative basis on which the first count might be proved. These grounds are linked, and it is convenient to deal with them together.

20Relying on the first ground, Mr Odgers sought orders that the verdict on count 1 be quashed and that a verdict of guilty of reckless wounding be substituted. He did not refer to the appellant's evidence, but was content to base his arguments on the evidence in the Crown case and the inferences to be drawn from it. 

21He submitted that the Crown's case on the intent to cause grievous bodily harm had been squarely founded upon the evidence of the stomping, alleging that it was at that point that the intent was formed. Consistently with the case for the appellant put at the trial, he acknowledged that that inference was available but, in the light of the evidence of Dr Collins, the jury could not reasonably have been satisfied that it was at that point that the grievous bodily harm was caused. He noted that Dr Collins' evidence that the serious injury would have to have been caused by impact to the right side of the head was not challenged by the Crown. He relied upon the fact that several of the eye-witnesses said that the stomp was to the left side of the head and none of them said that it was to the right side.

22He also noted that, on Dr Collins' evidence, the serious injury could have been caused by a punch to the right side of Mr Arnold's head or that side of his head striking the ground. Again he argued that, on the Crown case, the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm had not been formed at that stage. He added that, in any event, the inference of an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm could not readily be drawn simply from punching. As he put it in written submissions, the reasonable possibility could not be excluded that the appellant intended only to fight Mr Arnold, without the requisite intent. He submitted that throwing punches at another man, even forceful punches directed to the head, ""does not normally permit an inference beyond reasonable doubt that there is an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.""

23He acknowledged that an argument might be advanced that there was an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm at the time of the stomp and that, given the close proximity in time between that action and the punching, it could reasonably be inferred that there was such an intention from the outset of the incident. He added that no such argument was put at the trial. In any event, he argued, the evidence of Dr Collins conveys that the stomp was not as forceful as the witnesses suggested. It was not the source of the grievous bodily harm and, accepting that it was delivered to the left side of the head, there was only bruising and swelling on that side of the face. He also noted that it was immediately before the stomping that the appellant spoke to Mr Arnold, suggesting that he was unaware that Mr Arnold might have been unconscious and seriously injured. Even if it be accepted that the stomp was delivered with an intent to cause grievous bodily harm, he said, it was not implausible that the intent was formed only at that point and that the appellant did not have that intent when he initiated the assault.

24It was these same considerations which were the basis of the second ground, challenging the adequacy of the trial judge's directions. As I understand it, the reference in that ground to ""the alternative basis"" on which the offence might have been proved was to the proposition that the jury might find that the grievous bodily harm was occasioned by a punch, or Mr Arnold falling to the ground, at a time when the appellant had the requisite intent. Mr Odgers submitted that the directions failed to convey to the jury that to find the appellant guilty they needed to be satisfied of an intention to cause grievous bodily harm at the time of the act or acts which caused that harm. He argued that they could have been left with the impression that it was sufficient if they found that the appellant caused grievous bodily harm and that, at some time during the entire incident, he had the necessary intention.

25I am persuaded by the arguments of the Crown prosecutor in this court that neither ground is made out. As to the first ground, it seems to me that it was open to the jury to conclude that the stomping action caused the grievous bodily harm. Plainly enough, this was a violent and fast moving incident in which it is unlikely that the witnesses would have a precise recollection of the exact portion of Mr Arnold's head to which the stomp was delivered. Even if it had been delivered to the left side of the head, the serious injury could still have resulted from the forceful contact of the right side of the head with the ground. Dr Collins' opinion that this was not the case appears to have been based upon the erroneous assumption that there was no injury to the left side of the face. In fact, as I have said, there was.

26However that may be, I find it unnecessary to reach a conclusion whether it was the stomp which caused the serious injury. In the way in which the case was left to the jury, both in final addresses and in the summing-up, that finding was not essential to establishing guilt because it was not the Crown case that the intent to cause grievous bodily harm was formed only at that point. So much is apparent from the second passage of the Crown prosecutor's address quoted at [15] above. While the stomp was relied upon as powerful evidence that the appellant had the requisite intent, that passage conveys a submission by the prosecutor that the intent may well have been formed earlier in the incident or, indeed, from the outset. 

27In my view, there is an air of unreality about focusing upon a particular act of the appellant during the incident and determining whether he had the requisite intent at the time of that act. On the evidence in the Crown case, this was an attack of some ferocity from the moment it was initiated, involving repeated punches to Mr Arnold's head and culminating in the stomping action. It was a brief episode of continuous violence. What can be seen on the CCTV footage occupies less than half a minute and, no doubt, the stomp was delivered a very short time thereafter. It was well open to the jury to conclude that the appellant intended to cause grievous bodily harm throughout the incident, and, in that event, it was unnecessary to determine precisely which act or acts of his caused the serious injury.

28Viewing the matter in that way, it was also unnecessary for the trial judge to direct the jury that they had to decide which act caused the grievous bodily harm and determine whether that act was accompanied by the requisite intent. Yet, in my view, that was the effect of his Honour's directions. In the passage from the summing-up which I have quoted at [18], his Honour referred to the issue of whether the grievous bodily harm was the result of the stomp or of a punch, clearly in the context of directing the jury about the requisite intent. At the conclusion of that passage he told the jury that it was entirely a matter for them, saying that if they were not satisfied it was the stomp but were satisfied it was the punch, they would ""then go on to consider against that background whether the intent has been made out."" Later in the summing-up, in the course of summarising the Crown case, his Honour said that the jury would ""have to look at what mechanics on this night do you find beyond reasonable doubt caused the injury, was it the punch, was it the stomping, that is an issue for you and it is against that basis you work out the issue of the intent."" 

29These directions were adequate and, on the view of the matter which I have expressed, were more than was required. No redirection on the issue was sought by counsel for the appellant at the trial, and nothing in his Honour's directions could be said to have given rise to a miscarriage of justice.

30I would dismiss the appeal.

31SCHMIDT J: I agree with Hidden J.

2759436,R v Rumbel [2012] NSWDC 139,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 4 November 2010 the offender Derek Rumbel was mourning the loss of his son, a young child who had died in a house fire precisely one year before. On the same day the victim of this matter, Mr Sean Roswell, was celebrating the birth of a new daughter to a relation of his. Unfortunately both groups of people, those mourning the tragedy and those celebrating the happy event, chose to do so by consuming excessive quantities of alcohol.

2The victim and some friends and relations of his, visited the home of relations of the offender after they had all been drinking. Once the two groups got together, things were amicable for a number of hours and everyone continued to drink even more. For reasons which are unclear however, an argument broke out between Mr Rumbel and Sean Roswell. No-one knows what started it but it resulted in the offender head butting the victim to the face, causing his nose to bleed. That is a matter appearing on the Form 1 to be taken into account when I sentence the offender for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm I will now describe.

3The two men were asked to leave. They did so but the argument continued. The offender was the aggressor. He said ""Come on"". The victim's nephew Jamie Roswell tried to settle things down. He walked between the two men and tried to push them back saying ""Stop being an idiot"". The offender was not having any of that. He said ""I'm going to smash you, you cunt"". Eventually the matter turned physical again with the offender delivering five to eight closed fist punches to the victim's head. One of those connected with his eye and he fell face first to the ground, striking his head on the kerbing as he went down. He appeared to be unconscious. He was not moving. He was not responding but the offender had not had enough. He continued to throw blows to the victim as he lay on the ground. Mr Jamie Roswell then intervened again, pushing the offender away. Not satisfied with what he had done already, the offender said to Jamie Roswell ""Come on, do you want to have a go"". After Mr Roswell sensibly told the offender to wake up, eventually the offender walked off.

4No-one realised how significantly Sean Roswell had been injured at the time. He was able to get up and although he was shaking and unsteady, he could speak and stumble home. The next morning however he could not be roused. He was transported by ambulance to Maitland Hospital and then airlifted to John Hunter Hospital. Not surprisingly, investigations revealed that he had suffered a large acute subdural haematoma as well as fractures to his face and eye socket. He remained in intensive care for some time and has suffered a number of significant injuries. He will bear the lifelong consequences of the offender's violent actions.

5A medical certificate tendered today from a doctor said that:

""I am of the opinion that the injury was severe and nearly fatal. The prognosis for return to normal function is poor. It is my understanding that the patient remains quite disabled and dependent on others for care."" 

6A victim impact statement was also tendered. It bears out the expectations of the doctor. I will read it in full because it is important that everyone here understand exactly what has happened to Mr Sean Roswell because of the violence inflicted upon him by the offender. He says:

""Since the assault I have been in and out of hospital for 12 months and there is no end in sight. I am still going in and out of hospital. I have had three plates put in my head and then removed because of infection. At the moment I have no plates and I am supposed to wear a helmet to protect my brain 24 hours a day. People stare and ask questions all the time so I hardly leave the house. I have blood clots in my legs and I have to take blood thinners. Now I can't get another plate put in because an operation would be too dangerous and I could bleed to death. I now have epilepsy. 43 years old and now I'm an epileptic and have to take medication every day. My room looks like a pharmacy with all my medications. I have a house that I can't live in because I'm afraid of being on my own. I feel like if anything happened while I was alone I wouldn't be able to protect myself. I stay with my brother because I feel safer there. He does night shift and when he's away I stay awake all night. I sleep mostly during the day when I feel safer. I can't enjoy time with my daughter because I can't do the things I used to do with her. I can't even kick a football, take the boat out, swim with her. My family have got to do these things with her and I can't even go. What's the use of going when I can't do anything. I can't be in the sun and enjoy summer. My life will never be the same because I can't do any of the things I used to enjoy. I have mood swings that I never used to have. I can go from happy to angry in a minute, from one extreme to the other. I get upset a lot especially when it comes to the loss of time with my daughter.""


7Of course Mr Rumbel did not intend those tragic consequences but they resulted directly from his actions. To his credit, once the offender realised that he had caused those injuries, he made admissions to the police as to what he had done and has co-operated thereafter with the authorities. Initially he pleaded guilty to an offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm but following the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Blackwell he withdrew that plea of guilty, (not surprisingly given that decision), and has now entered a plea of guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Although that plea was entered late in procedural terms it is no fault of Mr Rumbel's that that was the case. Because of his early plea of guilty and the attitude that he has displayed to the prosecution in this matter, with its resulting utilitarian benefit, the sentence I will impose upon him is 25 percent less than it would otherwise have been.

8Mr Rumbel is now 27 years of age. His upbringing was quite poor in the sense that he was exposed to violence as a young child. His stepfather perpetrated domestic violence upon his mother and, when the offender would intervene in an effort to protect his mother, he too was assaulted. The relationship that the offender had with his stepfather was characterised by abuse and Mr Rumbel was blamed for minor misbehaviours. He was regularly beaten with a wooden pipe that actually was given a name. The psychologist says that, given a history of ambivalent and disruptive relationships, it is not surprising his attachment to significant others in his life has been aggressive and volatile. That is borne out by the offender's criminal history. Although he is in a relationship and has had children to his partner, that has been characterised by domestic violence inflicted by the offender upon his partner. He has many prior convictions for assaults and indeed, at the time of this offence, was on three bonds to be of good behaviour, one of which was for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. His criminal history indicates clearly a history of violence and, as the psychologist reports, an attitude of using violence as a means of solving social problems. 

9The offender has spent some time in custody, 287 days. The question becomes whether it is necessary to return Mr Rumbel to custody. It is clear that the offender drinks to excess. He said that after his son died in the house fire he turned to the bottle and drank excessively for some time. He has moderated his alcohol consumption of more recent times but, in view of his criminal history and in view of its relationship with alcohol, it cannot be said that the offender is unlikely to commit further offences in the future. 

10The offender, consistent with his intention that the victim not suffer injuries as serious as the ones he did suffer, expressed his remorse. He accepts his responsibility for what he has done. He did not intend Mr Roswell to suffer as he has and clearly acknowledges that it was his actions which have led to that awful outcome.

11These significant injuries would ordinarily, in the past, have resulted in the offender facing a much more serious charge, indeed the sort of charge that he was originally charged with. It is no breach of the rule in De Simoni v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383 to take into account harm which would amount to grievous bodily harm, in the circumstances of this case, following the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93 because I will not be sentencing Mr Rumbel on the basis that he intended in any way to cause that grievous bodily harm. I am therefore able to take into account the awful injuries suffered by Mr Roswell in determining the appropriate penalty. I am also able to take into account, and I do, the level of violence. This was not just a single punch but a sustained series of blows which continued after Mr Roswell was lying helpless on the ground. I repeat, the offender was on a bond to be of good behaviour for this very offence at the time he committed this offence and so I have no other option but to return Mr Rumbel to custody. The period he has thus far spent in gaol is insufficient to reflect the objective gravity of what he has done.

12I will find special circumstances in the offender's favour. It is in his interests as well as the community's that he be given extra assistance upon his release from custody to deal with his problems of alcohol consumption which have led directly to this offence. 

13The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of two years and a head sentence of three and a half years to date from 1 September 2011. I take into account the Form 1 matter of course. The offender is thus eligible to be released to parole on 31 August 2013.

2759437,R v Batterham [2012] NSWDC 185,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Anyone who looks at what led up to the terrible events of 21 May 2011 would see that the offender's driving history would make it clear that an offence of this kind was inevitable. The offender appears for sentence today, having pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to an offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, the circumstance of aggravation being that his driving ability was very substantially impaired by a combination of drugs and alcohol.

2He is to be sentenced also for failing to stop and assist after an impact. And also on a 166 certificate there appears an offence of driving whilst disqualified.

3The offender has, remarkably, four prior convictions for driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood, including three for high range PCA. That he would one day do what he did on 21 May last year is no surprise at all.

4On that day Mr Troy Jordan and Mr Allan Edmonds were driving lawfully along Vincent Street, Cessnock. The offender, Timothy James Batterham was not driving lawfully, he was very heavily intoxicated by both alcohol and drugs. 

5The evidence suggests that his blood alcohol reading at the time of the collision I am about to describe would have been between .216 and .286, with the most likely level of .243. On top of that the offender had taken some diazepam. The statement of facts reveals that the levels found in the offender's blood were slightly higher than the usual therapeutic range and indicated very recent use. This was a terrible combination, high levels of alcohol together with diazepam in the blood of a man who appears to have cared little for his obligations to keep within the road rules whilst behind the wheel of a car. In fact he should not have even been there in the first place, he was a disqualified driver.

6There was a witness to what occurred. Mr Dean Walmsley was driving south along Vincent Street, heading in the same direction as the offender. He pulled over to the side of the road to answer his mobile phone, (yet another person who was obeying the road rules in contrast to Mr Batterham).

7He went to open the door of his car. As he did so the offender's vehicle drove past him, so close that it almost took his mirror off. He noticed that the offender did not even have his headlights on. He saw the offender driving all over the road, he drove across the incorrect side of the road onto the gravel area, back onto the incorrect side of the road and kept driving in the incorrect north bound lane.

8Unfortunately for Mr Jordan and Mr Edmonds they were also in that lane, but it was their correct lane, they were heading in the opposite direction to the offender. There was a head-on collision.

9The force of the impact was significant. Mr Edmonds and Mr Jordan were in a Mitsubishi Triton four wheel drive. The force of the impact was such that the front passenger wheel of the Triton was torn off, the vehicle rotated anti clockwise, mounted the kerb, severed a small tree and then rolled over. The vehicle had travelled some twenty eight metres away from the point of collision.

10The witness, Mr Walmsley, and other people who were nearby ran or drove to the scene. They saw the offender get out of his vehicle, they smelt alcohol on him. He merely stared at them before walking away. Eventually he was located. He told lies to the police but was not formally interviewed because of his level of intoxication.

11The driver of the other car, Mr Jordan, did not suffer grievous bodily harm, but Mr Edmonds did. He suffered a rupture of his left hemidiaphragm, fractured his pelvic bone and hip which required external fixation, a fractured left femur that required insertion of a metal rod and four nails, a fractured jaw that required insertion of plates and about thirty screws, a tear in his thoracic aorta which required urgent surgery, a lacerated bowel, and not surprisingly, various more minor cuts and bruises. He underwent urgent surgery. The doctors considered his injuries were life threatening.

12He was in hospital and bedridden for about two months. He required further surgery in July to remove the external fixation of his pelvis. Then physiotherapy commenced until he was discharged from hospital. He required significant assistance with mobility and daily activities after his discharge.

13He has been undergoing physiotherapy. He complained in December, some considerable time after the collision, that his left hip does not always support his weight and it feels like he gets disjointed at times. His balance on his left leg was significantly reduced and his left hip stability was decreased. He complained of pain to his knees and lower back. His legs are now of uneven length. He has been unfit for work of any kind since the collision according to an expert's certificate dated 22 February 2012. That certificate estimated that Mr Edmonds would be unfit for work for another three months. The prognosis with all the injuries was uncertain. A doctor expressed the view that Mr Edmonds will have long term problems with his left, it says joint, but I presume that means left hip joint, at least. He also sees a psychiatrist as a result of psychological issues which have arisen out of this collision.

14So Mr Batterham's behaviour has led to significant consequences for an entirely innocent person. Mr Batterham has indicated quite clearly a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. There thus needs to be a substantial component of personal deterrence built into the sentences I must impose upon him. General deterrence, of course, is also important.

15It will not surprise anyone to learn that Mr Batterham has a problem with alcohol. He is now 34 years of age and he lives with his partner of approximately six years, together with their eighteen month old daughter and his partner's two children from a previous relationship. The material put before me today suggests that the offender is a good father and has been able to moderate his drinking where he is caring for the children.

16The offender lost his father in a tragic mine accident in 1996. His grandmother, for whom he had provided care, died in 2003. These two losses have greatly affected the offender and no doubt have contributed to the problems that the offender has with alcohol. However not too much can really be made of the unfortunate circumstance that Mr Batterham has a problem with alcohol. To put the matter bluntly the courts really do not care how much he drinks. What they do care about is an offender such as Mr Batterham who drives whilst highly intoxicated. I have got no doubt that magistrates warned Mr Batterham that if he continued to drink and drive he would one day end up injuring or even killing someone. So that has come to pass.

17He is currently unemployed and he is in receipt of a Newstart benefit. He told the author of the pre-sentence report that he does not have to look for work because he is under the care of a medical practitioner. He has worked in the past. .

18Mr Healey told me that both he and his client recognise that a custodial sentence was the inevitable outcome of today's proceedings. That of course is correct. 

19Mr Healey also told me that this matter had been not reached on two previous occasions. I regard that as significant. It is a significant matter for a person to come to court knowing that they will not be going home again, knowing that they will be going to gaol, and then to find that because of pressure of work their case is not being dealt with. Unfortunately that does happen from time to time in these courts. It should not have happened twice, once was bad enough. I have taken that matter into account in formulating the appropriate sentence imposed on Mr Batterham.

20Somewhat strangely in cases of this kind there is no evidence of remorse expressed by the offender. I say somewhat strangely because in almost every case of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm or death the offender does not really intend to harm anyone else and so remorse is commonplace. But the most that Mr Healey could point to was an apology made through his counsel and his pleas of guilty. I do not regard that as any evidence at all of remorse. The offender is not to be punished for not saying he was sorry, but clearly he is not entitled to any leniency on the basis that he has expressed any remorse for the terrible consequences he and he alone has brought about.

21There are a number of offences for which the offender must be sentenced today. They each represent separate aspects of the offender's criminality. It would be therefore inappropriate to impose totally concurrent sentences. The offender should not have been behind the wheel because he was disqualified. He should not have been behind the wheel because he was intoxicated and as a result he caused significant harm. And the offender should not have failed to stop and render assistance after seeing the awful collision that he and he alone was responsible for. Those separate aspects of the offender's criminality must be dealt with by partial accumulation.

22Not without some hesitation I am prepared to make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. My hesitation arises from the failure of the offender to take advantage of leniency that was offered to him in the past. He continues to offend, as is demonstrated by the matters to be dealt with today. But because he has, of more recent times, taken steps to deal with his problems with alcohol and because it will be to the community's advantage if he is able to deal with those problems and the chances of him putting his excessive alcohol consumption behind him are increased if he is supervised upon his relief from custody, I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour.

23I sentence the offender as follows;

24For the offence of failing to stop and render assistance, he is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of twelve months to date from 14 June 2012. That is today.

25For the offence of driving whilst disqualified, he is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to date from 14 September 2012, that is three months hence. He disqualified from driving for one year cumulative to the current period of disqualification. 

26Those sentences are fixed terms because of the sentence I will now announce.

27For the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of two and a half years with a head sentence of four and a half years to date from 14 December 2012, that is six months hence. He is disqualified from driving on that charge for a period of four years to be accumulated on all other periods of disqualified driving.

28He is thus eligible to be released to parole on 13 June 2015. The overall sentence being one consisting of an effective non parole period of three years with a period of eligibility for parole of two years, making a total sentence of five years.

29I will dismiss the backup charges on the 166 certificate.

30I will remit the High Range PCA to the local court. If necessary it can be dealt with there.

2759441,R v Milat & Klein [2012] NSWSC 634,"Judgment
Introduction
1Matthew Milat and Cohen Klein have both pleaded guilty to a charge that on 20 November 2010 they murdered David Auchterlonie.
2At the time of the offence Matthew Milat was approximately one month short of 18 years old, and Cohen Klein had turned 18 two months earlier.  Because of Milat's age at that time, the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987  (""the Children C P Act"") apply in relation to the case against him.  Nevertheless, at the outset of the proceedings I made an order authorising the publication and broadcasting of his name.  The case had already attracted a considerable amount of publicity in which his name had been openly ventilated.  Moreover, as will emerge later, the fact that his surname is Milat is relevant to some aspects of the offence, and therefore to the sentencing process.  Accordingly, taking into account the seriousness of the offence, I considered that it was appropriate to make an order under s 15C(2) of the Children C P Act.  Indeed Mr Stratton SC, who appeared for Milat, did not oppose the making of such an order.
3A number of factual issues arose during the sentencing proceedings, some of them relating to matters which are central to the sentencing process.  The most significant of these relates to the extent to which the offence was premeditated by each of the offenders.  I propose first to set out the facts of the case that are not in dispute.  Then I will discuss the disputed issues and make my findings in relation to each of the offenders separately.  After that I will deal with the other matters which are relevant to sentence.
Factual Background
4At the time of the offence Matthew Milat was living with his grandparents in Bargo.  Until about two months earlier he had been working in Newcastle and living with his then partner and their very young daughter.  However in September 2010 he lost his job and moved back to Bargo.  During that two month period Milat spent a considerable amount of time with the co-offender Klein.  He also started to see quite a bit of the deceased, David Auchterlonie, and the latter's friend Chase Day.
5On Saturday 20 November 2010, Milat spent much of the day in the company of Klein.  They were smoking cannabis from time to time, and talking to other friends.  On occasions during the day Milat, often in the presence of Klein, said that the two of them (and possibly others) were proposing to go to the Belanglo State Forest that night and kill someone.  The deceased's nickname, ""Ockto"" was mentioned.  I will be returning to these conversations later and describing them in more detail, as they are highly relevant to the major disputed issues in relation to both offenders.
620 November 2010 was the deceased David Auchterlonie's 17th birthday.  He spent much of the day enjoying his birthday celebrations, visiting friends and family.  At various times during the day there were telephone calls or messages between the deceased and Milat or Klein.  That evening the deceased was at his friend Chase Day's home.  The telephone calls and messages continued.  In one of these calls the offender Milat, who was using Klein's telephone, convinced the deceased to go with them to the Belanglo State Forest.  The deceased told Day that Milat had called him earlier in the day, ""asking him to go out to Belanglo to have a few drinks and a bit of fun.""
7Later that evening Milat and Klein collected the deceased and Day in Milat's car from a point around the corner from Day's home.  This was probably between about 8.30pm and 9.30pm.  The four of them drove first to the Shell Service Station at Sutton Forest.  Milat and the deceased went into the service station, apparently for the purpose of finding scissors to cut up some cannabis which the deceased had obtained.  Afterwards the deceased, Klein and Day went into McDonald's at Sutton Forest and purchased food.  The offender Milat remained in the car.
8It was immediately after this that Milat drove the car into the Belanglo State Forest.  Klein was in the front passenger seat and the other two were in the back seat.  When they were a short distance into the forest Milat parked the car.  He got out and went to the back of the car, beside the boot.  At that point the deceased got into the front seat and started to cut up some cannabis.  Day was still sitting in the back seat of the car.
9The evidence shows that Klein got out of the car and joined Milat near the boot.  Music was playing from the deceased's phone inside the car.  At about that time Klein, who was holding his mobile phone, activated its video and audio recording facilities.  An image of the deceased in the front seat of the car was apparently recorded.  Otherwise, the remaining recording is solely audio and is contained on a CD which was tendered by the Crown.  
10The existence of this recording means that there is a precise record of much of what was said by the participants during the 14 minutes leading up to the death of the deceased.
11The initial part of the CD records some general discussion about the deceased rolling a joint.  Klein is also recorded as saying, quietly:   ""Yeah, go it"".  Milat said ""Can you feel the adrenaline?""  Klein replied ""Yeah.""  Klein then said to the deceased that there might be a bong in the boot of the car and suggested that he go and have a look.  The deceased accordingly got out of the car and went towards the boot.  Not long afterwards Milat took a double bladed axe, which had apparently been in the boot, and struck the deceased in the torso.
12By this time Chase Day was also out of the car.  Klein is recorded as telling him, on more than one occasion, to get back into the car.  Day did so, followed by Klein.  A further conversation took place between them inside the car which I shall be referring to later.  It is highly relevant in the case relating to the offender Klein.
13At about the time that Klein got back into the car with Day, the music stopped.  Clearly one of them had turned it off.  Klein's telephone continued to record every word of what transpired between Milat and the deceased outside the car.  It is apparent that Klein was holding the telephone with his arm extended out the car window during the whole of this time.  The events which were recorded were conceded by Mr Stratton to be ""chilling.""  This is, with respect, something of an understatement.  The deceased was clearly in great pain from the blow which had already been delivered.  At least one more blow was inflicted during the exchange which followed.  The deceased was running around the car, trying to escape from Milat, and was desperately trying to placate him.  After some time Milat ordered that he lie on the ground and then stood over him, threatening him in what the Crown rightly described as ""a most cruel, callous and brutal manner.""  Milat accused the deceased of spreading stories about him and sticking his nose into his business.  Finally Milat swung the axe and struck the deceased in the back of his head.  The sound of the axe hitting the deceased was caught in the recording.  The deceased died instantly.  Immediately afterwards the recording was stopped.
14Milat then returned towards the car, carrying the axe.  A little later Day got out of the car and went to where the deceased was lying.  He dragged him into an area away from the road where he and Milat covered the deceased's body with branches from surrounding trees.  The offenders and Day then got back into the car and the three of them drove back to Bargo.
15It will be necessary to refer back to some of the details of this recording in due course as it is highly relevant to the central disputed issues in the trial, namely the extent to which the killing of the deceased was premeditated by each of the offenders.
16At about 11.30 that night Milat and Klein went to the home of some friends whom I shall call by their first names, Ken and Sarah.  Arrangements were made for Klein to sleep in Sarah's car overnight.  Milat drove off and shortly afterwards, by arrangement, picked up another young man named ""Damien"".  The two of them went to another friend's home where they watched movies until 2 or 2.30am.  
17The next day, 21 November, the offender Milat was described as in effect gloating about his actions of the previous evening.  He was quoted as saying ""You know me, you know my family.  You know the last name Milat.  I did what they do.""  He described striking his victim in the back of the head with an axe.  He said that he had put his clothing and the axe in a bag weighed down with bricks and thrown it into the river.  His car also had been cleaned in order to remove all traces of the offence.
18Later that day, 21 November, Chase Day told his father what had happened and his father took him to Picton Police Station where he made a full statement.  He led police to the Belanglo Forest and showed them where the deceased's body lay hidden under branches.  A later post-mortem report showed that the deceased had died due to a single chop wound in the back of the head which had entered the skull and underlying brain matter a few centimetres in depth.  There was also a blunt injury to the deceased's torso which was associated with a fracture of the ninth rib and haemorrhaging of adjacent soft tissues.  There were various abrasions to the deceased's forehead and chin.
19On Monday 22 November 2010 the offender Milat was arrested.  He declined to enter into a record of interview.
20Later on that day, 22 November 2010 the offender Klein was also arrested.  He entered into a recorded interview in which he admitted accompanying Milat and the others to the Belanglo Forest on the Saturday night, but said that he did not know what Milat was planning.  When they arrived in the forest he said that he remained in the car with Chase Day, trying not to look at what was happening between Milat and the deceased.  After it was over Milat came back to the car and asked the two of them to get out.  He ""nearly spewed"", he said, when he saw the deceased's body.  He denied that he had previously spoken to Milat about harming the deceased.
21The offender Klein was arrested and charged.  He has been in custody ever since.  On 4 January 2011 a further recorded interview took place with him.  On this occasion he told police that, earlier on Saturday 20 November, Milat had been talking about wanting to kill the deceased.  However Klein had thought that Milat was ""bullshitting"" and paid no attention to him.  Otherwise Klein's account of what took place in the forest that night was not materially different from what he had said in his earlier interview.  In this second interview he was asked where his mobile phone was during the assault and killing of the deceased.  He said that it was in his pocket in the car.  He denied making any audio or visual recording on the phone.  
22When the police initially took possession of Klein's mobile phone there was no apparent recording of the killing of the deceased, as it had been deleted.  However the police forensic team later retrieved the recording, which then constituted the primary evidence against both offenders.
23With this background, I now turn to discuss the principal disputed issues in the case.  In general, the disputes relate less to the facts themselves than to the inferences which should be drawn from those facts.
24Neither of the offenders gave evidence during the sentencing proceedings.
The primary issues in dispute
25The primary issue in dispute in relation to the offender Milat is the extent to which the killing of David Auchterlonie was premeditated; and, in relation to the offender Klein, whether there was a prior agreement between himself and Milat that the killing would take place.  These are quite separate issues.  However a finding that the killing of the deceased by Matthew Milat was not premeditated must inevitably lead to a finding that there was no prior agreement between the two offenders to kill the deceased.
26These are by no means the only disputed issues in the proceedings.  However the resolution of the other matters will almost entirely depend on my findings in relation to the central issue of premeditation in relation to each of the offenders.  I therefore turn to discuss that matter.  For obvious reasons I will commence with the evidence relating to the offender Matthew Milat.
Matthew Milat:  A premeditated killing?
27It was the Crown's submission that this was a cold blooded, premeditated killing on the part of the offender Milat.  Indeed, the Crown designated it a ""thrill kill.""  Mr Stratton, however, submitted that Milat's intention, when they went to the Belanglo Forest, was merely to assault and injure the deceased.  It was only during the course of their final confrontation that Milat became so worked up and angry that he formed the intention to kill the deceased, only a short time before he inflicted the fatal blow.
28It goes without saying that it is for the Crown to prove its more serious version of the facts beyond reasonable doubt.
29In order to explore this issue it is necessary to turn to evidence relating to the following matters:
Statements made by Milat earlier on the day of the killing.What was said by Milat both immediately preceding and during the course of the assault on the deceased, as recorded on the co-offender's telephone.Statements made by Milat after the killing and before his arrest.Poems written by Milat whilst he was in prison.What Milat later said to representatives of Juvenile Justice and to a psychiatrist Dr Furst.
30I will discuss each of these matters in turn, as briefly as the circumstances permit.
31On the morning of 20 November, the day of the killing, Milat said to his new girlfriend Rachael:  ""Me, Cohen and someone else are going to kill Ockto.""  She said:  ""Don't be stupid.  Stop joking, no you're not.""  The co-offender Klein was standing next to Milat at the time and the two of them laughed.  Rachael asked:  ""Who's the other person?""  Milat told her that the other person was Chase Day.  At the time she thought that they were joking.
32That afternoon Rachael was sitting in Milat's car with Milat and Klein.  She said that they were talking about what they would be doing that night.  Milat rubbed his hands together and sounded excited.  He said:  ""We're going out to Belanglo.  Someone's going to die.""  She asked:  ""Who's going to Belanglo?""  She said that Milat and Klein started naming various people, and Milat ultimately said ""Chase will come.""  She asked:  ""Who are you going to kill?""  Milat replied ""Ockto"". 
33The Crown also relies on the fact that, at some stage that day Milat took the double headed axe, which was later used to kill the deceased, from the home of his friend Ken, and secured it in the boot of his car.
34I turn now to the events immediately preceding the killing of the deceased, as recorded on Klein's mobile telephone.  Whilst the deceased was still in the car, and Milat and Klein were near the boot at the back of the car, Klein can be heard whispering to Milat:  ""Yeah, go it.""  Milat said:  ""Can you feel the adrenaline?""  To which Klein replied:  ""Yeah.""  It was immediately after this that Klein suggested to the deceased that he should come around to the boot of the car and look for a ""bong"".
35I do not propose to go through all the details of the recorded exchange between Milat and the deceased after the first blow had been inflicted to the deceased's torso.  It is extremely distressing material.  However, Mr Stratton relied on certain passages as supporting the proposition that Milat had not yet formed an intention to kill the deceased, but was in effect teaching the deceased a lesson so that he would modify his behaviour in the future.  These passages included Milat saying the following:  ""Go around and tell people my fucking business and you wind up hurt, cunt.""  Later, Milat said:  ""Because if I don't fucking kill you right now, I'm leaving you here tonight.  'cause right now you are not my fuckin top priority.  Don't fuckin move.""  Later again, Milat said:  ""I warned you that I was a bit of a fuckin nut lately.  You didn't listen, you didn't listen cunt.  Do you want to listen next time I say something like that?""
36Mr Stratton also relied on the anger expressed by Milat during this exchange to show that it was, as Mr Stratton submitted, a hot blooded, unpremeditated killing rather than a cold blooded one, as was submitted by the Crown.
37In some respects, a reading of the transcript of this recording might appear to support Mr Stratton's submissions.  The words used by Milat appear, on paper, to denote a great deal of anger.  However, a different impression is gained from listening to the recording itself.  A number of the passages where the words would appear to indicate extreme anger on Milat's part are spoken very precisely and deliberately.  The apparent anger, suggested by the words used, is not conveyed by the manner in which they were spoken.
38Moreover, no provocation whatsoever was offered by the deceased which was likely to have fuelled Milat's anger.  To the contrary, the deceased was being entirely submissive during the whole of this episode.  He was desperately trying to placate Milat.  Additionally, as the Crown pointed out, Milat forced the deceased to relinquish his phone and his wallet during the course of this exchange, which denotes a degree of deliberation on his part at that time.
39I turn now to describe the statements made by Milat after the killing and before his arrest.  These are set out in the agreed statement of facts.  
40Immediately after the killing Milat drove Klein and Day back to Bargo.  During the course of the journey Milat said:  ""That was such an adrenaline rush"".  Klein, who was sitting next to him, said ""I told you that you're going to go down the same path as your uncle.""  Milat also told Day during this trip that the handle of the axe had been wrapped in electrical tape so that they could rip it off and remove their fingerprints.
41Later that night, after dropping off Day and Klein, Milat was watching a movie with some friends, including Rachael.  She asked him:  ""Did you do it?""  Milat responded:  ""Yes.  I understand if you're scared or worried, but he deserved it.""
42The next morning Milat drove to the home of his friend Ken, in the company of his friend Damien.  It was from Ken's home that Milat had obtained the axe the previous day.  Klein, who had spent the night in the car outside Ken's home, was described as looking very stressed.  Milat who was laughing, said to Ken:  ""first one to ten.""
43A little later Damien accompanied Milat when the latter drove to his grandparent's home.  During the journey Milat said to him:  ""Guess who I killed?""  Damien asked:  ""Who?""  Milat said:  ""Nah, don't worry about it.""  Damien said:  ""Nah, who?""  Milat said:  ""Auchto.""  Milat also said to him:  ""Ken killed someone.  I told Ken, and we said first to ten.""
44Damien asked Milat:  ""What did you kill him with?""  Milat said:  ""I hit him in the head with an axe.""  Damien asked:  ""Who did you get if off?""  Milat said: ""Ken.""  Damien then asked whether he was serious, to which Milat responded:  ""I'm serious.  Don't tell anyone.  If Ken finds out that I told anyone he will kill me because the axe has Ken's DNA on it.  If I find out you told anyone I will kill you.""
45Later that morning Milat and Damien went to another friend's home.  The friend's mother was also present.  Whilst they were there Milat said ""I took someone out to Belanglo last night.  I hit him in the back of the head with an axe.  I was there with two other guys.  One of them didn't want to help me move the body.  I said, 'if you don't do it, I'm going to do you too'.""  The friend's mother described Milat as saying:  ""You know me, you know my family.  You know the last name Milat.  I did what they do.""  Milat also referred to the axe getting stuck in the victim's head.  He said ""I had to kick the back of his head to get it loose.""  He was excited and bragging about what he had done.
46As already indicated, Milat was arrested on the morning of Monday 22 November 2010.  In the meantime he had disposed of all external signs of the killing by cleaning his car, and by putting the axe and his bloodstained clothing into a bag weighed down with bricks and throwing it into the river.
47Milat has been in custody since 22 November 2010.  Whilst in prison hewrote a number of poems which he placed in an envelope addressed to his mother and asked her to put them somewhere safe.  The mail was intercepted by Juvenile Justice and the poems were passed on to the police.  Two of them appear to be recounting the events leading up to the killing of the deceased.  One of these is titled ""Killer looks and on evil side"".  The other is ""Your last day"".  This latter poem is particularly chilling.  I would not normally have quoted it during my sentencing remarks.  However it is highly relevant to the issue for determination here.  Accordingly I think I should quote it in full:
""Click-clack,hear that,stopping in the, middle of the track,Are you Getting Nervous in the back,Should be Cxxt your getting wAcked,talk shit here, talk shit there,No-one'z really gunna care,but talk shit with every breath,You just signed away your health,I can see you start to sweat,Wanderin what your gunna get,hopin 4-1 in the head,Cxxt ILL Put it in Your Leg,tell me, ARE YA HAVIN FUN,get up Cxxt, And start to run,how fAr are ya gunna get,Your Match Cxxt you have just Met,stumblin all OVA the place,Hear the crunch of leaves and feet,feel your heart, skip a beat,Are ya gunna get away,No hope kid this is your day,The day that you wont be found,Six feet under Neath the ground.""(Spelling as in original)
48In yet another poem, entitled ""Cold Life"", Milat finishes with the following words: 
""I am not fazed by blood or screamsNothing I do will haunt my dreamsMaybe they might scare you Cold blooded killer that's me not you.""
49All of these poems were written by Milat at the end of July 2011, more than nine months after the killing of the deceased.
50I turn finally to discuss what Milat has said, since going into custody, to representatives of Juvenile Justice and to a forensic psychiatrist.
51A background report dated 15 May 2012 was prepared by Juvenile Justice for the purpose of these proceedings.  Milat told the author of the report that the incident leading to the death of the deceased had escalated beyond a physical fight, due to the victim spreading negative rumours about him, Milat, in regard to his drug use and associated lifestyle.  Milat said that he had not planned to commit murder, but rather had wanted to let the victim go.  However he had become increasingly angry with the victim's responses during their discourse.  Milat said that, had the victim not spoken back, he would have left him at the scene with only the injury sustained to his torso, as had been the original plan.
52On 3 May 2012 Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, interviewed Milat at the Baxter Juvenile Justice Detention Centre at the request of Milat's legal representatives.  Milat told Dr Furst that he had known the deceased from childhood and regarded him as a friend.  However recently he had had a ""bad feeling"" about the deceased because he believed that the deceased had been spreading adverse rumours about him.  This made him angry, he said.  He acknowledged having thoughts of violence towards the deceased including thoughts of ""doing him in.""  Milat told Dr Furst that it was the deceased's idea to go to the Belanglo Forest.  He denied that there was any special meaning in the location in which the deceased was killed.  He acknowledged that he had placed the axe in his car, as he had planned on hurting the victim that night.  He said to Dr Furst, ""I was sick of him ... no one else knew how angry I was.""  He also said that he had been taking drugs and that if he had not been unstable at the time it probably would not have happened.
53Mr Stratton relied upon these statements as supporting the proposition that the killing of the deceased was not a premeditated one, but was rather an unexpected reaction to the events as they unfolded during the course of the evening.
54These statements, to Juvenile Justice and to Dr Furst, were made well after the killing, and after Milat had pleaded guilty to murder.  At that time he had every motive to minimise his culpability in the killing of the deceased.  Accordingly, I accept the Crown's submission that less weight should be attached to these statements than to what Milat said at around the time of the killing.  In this regard, I refer to the comments made by Whealy J in R v Elfar [2003] NSWCCA 358 at [24]-[25].  Moreover there are some aspects of these exculpatory statements which do not accord with the known evidence.  For example, it was clearly not the deceased's idea to go to the Belanglo Forest, as Milat told the Juvenile Justice counsellor.  All the evidence indicates that it was Milat himself who decided on this location.
55The choice of location itself is a significant matter.  The Belanglo Forest has assumed a form of notoriety in this State, as being the site where Milat's great uncle, Ivan Milat, lured a number of people and murdered them.  Ivan Milat is now serving seven life sentences for these offences. 
56As to the statements made by Milat around the time of the killing, virtually all of them support the inferences sought to be drawn by the Crown, namely that Milat had determined to kill the deceased at least by the morning of 20 November.  The only statement which could in any way be construed as supporting the inferences urged by Mr Stratton was when Milat said later that night to Rachael ""I understand if you're scared or worried, but he deserved it.""  
57The offender's actions at the time of the killing also support the Crown's interpretation of events.  If, as Milat told the Juvenile Justice counsellor, his original intention had been to leave the victim after inflicting only the injury to the torso, then one must ask why did he not do precisely that?  After the deceased was wounded in the torso, he cried out in pain and tried to run away from Milat.  However the latter continued to chase him, saying amongst other things, ""I'm fucking going to get you cunt"" and ""You're a fucking dead cunt Auchto"".
58If any additional support were required for the proposition that this was a premeditated killing on the part of Milat, it can be found in the poems he wrote in custody some nine months later.  Not only did Milat describe himself in one of these poems as a cold blooded killer, but the poem ""Your last day"", which I quoted earlier, has all the hallmarks of a gloated reminiscence of the deliberate tormenting and killing of the deceased.  It is impossible to see this as the work of a man who had intended only to injure the deceased, but who succumbed to anger at the last moment and ended up killing him.
59In all the circumstances, I have no doubt whatsoever that the killing of the deceased by the offender Milat was a deliberate premeditated one, as submitted by the Crown.
60I turn now to discuss the evidence relating to the extent of premeditation on the part of the offender Cohen Klein.
Cohen Klein:  Was there a prior agreement to kill the deceased?
61There is a significant dispute between the Crown and the defence as to the basis upon which the offender Klein should be sentenced for murder.  The Crown submits that there was a prior agreement between Milat and Klein to kill the deceased, which was formed at least 12 hours before the killing took place.  Mr Corr, who appeared for Klein, submitted that there was no such plan, and that Klein should be sentenced on the basis of an extended joint criminal enterprise.  In other words, Klein's involvement was that he was party to an agreement with Milat that the latter would assault the deceased, and that he, Klein, would assist Milat in getting the deceased to a place where the assault could happen.  He foresaw that grievous bodily harm might be caused, and nevertheless continued to participate.  The possibility of death resulting was not part of the common purpose, nor was it within Klein's contemplation.  It was on this basis that he entered his plea of guilty to murder.
62This is a very significant issue in the circumstances of this case.  If, as the Crown submits, Klein was a knowing party to the deliberate killing of the deceased by Milat, then it places his level of culpability very high within the range of culpability for the offence of murder.  On the other hand, if the circumstances are as Mr Corr submits, and Klein only contemplated that serious physical injury might be sustained by the victim, not that he might be killed, then it places the offence within the lower levels of culpability for murder.
63It goes without saying that the scenario submitted by the Crown must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  In other words, the scenario depicted by the Crown must be the only rational inference to be drawn from the facts established in the sentencing proceedings.
64The Crown relies on much of the evidence I have already described relating to Milat's state of mind as supporting the proposition that Klein knew, when they went into the Belanglo Forest, that the deceased was to be murdered.  These include statements made by Milat earlier on the day of the killing in the presence of Klein.  Milat said on more than one occasion that they would be killing ""Auchto"" that night.  As to this evidence, Klein told police in his record of interview of 4 January 2011 that he did not believe Milat when he talked about killing the deceased.  He assumed that Milat was ""bullshitting,"" as he commonly did, particularly when he was trying to be ""cool"" in front of girls.  
65The Crown further relies on what took place at the scene of the killing, as recorded on Klein's telephone.  First, it is abundantly clear from this recording that is was Klein, not Milat, who suggested to the deceased that he get out of the car and come around to the boot.  It was here that Milat first struck the deceased with the axe.  In this regard, it is interesting to note that in both his records of interview, on 22 November and again on 4 January 2011, Klein lied to the police, saying that it was Milat who told the deceased to get out of the car and go to the boot.
66Immediately before the deceased was asked to get out of the car, Klein is recorded as saying:  ""Yeah, go it.""  Milat said:  ""Can you feel the adrenaline?"" to which Klein replied:  ""Yeah.""  The Crown relies upon this exchange as supporting its version of events.  However as Mr Corr points out, this exchange is equally consistent with a prior agreement to assault the deceased as it is with a more sinister one.  
67Of considerably greater significance are the exchanges between Klein and Chase Day after the assault on the deceased had commenced.  Whilst the deceased was crying out in agony, Day was remonstrating with Milat, saying:  ""Don't do this shit man.  What the fuck you doing Matt.""  At much the same time Klein was recorded on a number of occasions as telling Day to get into the car.  Day did so, and Klein got in beside him.  During this time the deceased was running around the car trying to escape from Milat.  Klein was holding his telephone with his arm extended out the car window.  One can only assume that this was done deliberately for the purpose of recording what took place between Milat and the deceased.  The recording also picked up parts of the conversation which took place in the car between Klein and Day.  This is relied upon by the Crown in support of its contention that Klein was well aware that Milat was proposing to kill the deceased.  Inside the car Day is recorded as saying:  ""Stop this cunt, Cohen.""  At which point Klein called out to Milat:  ""Just do it fuckin.""  A little later Day said to Klein inside the car:  ""Don't let him do it, that's Auchto.""  Klein said:  ""Just be quiet."" 
68Of very considerable significance is the following exchange which took place between Klein and Day a short time later.
Klein:   Chase will you still talk to me?Day: I will talk to youKlein:  Don't say nothing...Day: No I won't.. Klein:  Alright, I made sure. Take my hand.  I made sure that you are fucking ... alright....I fucking made sure of it. He was talking about... he didn't want murder two.. That's why I told him... that I would keep you in the car and try talk to ya. Alright. ...  See how much I'm squeezin' your hand..Day:  Yeah I do.Klein: That's how much I fuckin shaking mate. That's how much I mean it cunt.
69The Crown attached particular significance to the statement by Klein that Milat did not want to ""murder two"", the clear inference being that Klein knew that he intended to murder one person.  As to this, Mr Corr submitted that when Klein made this comment he had finally realised, from what was happening outside the car, that what Milat had been saying earlier in the day about planning to kill the deceased was in fact true.  I shall be returning to this later.
70No further relevant conversation was recorded between Klein and Day on the mobile phone.  However the Crown relies upon the fact that Klein was deliberately recording everything that took place between Milat and the deceased outside the car.  It was not until immediately after the fatal blow was struck that he turned off the recorder.
71In addition to the conversations which were recorded on the phone, Day said that whilst they were in the car he asked Klein:  ""Is he really going to kill him?"" to which Klein replied ""I think so.""  
72Mr Corr relied on a number of pieces of evidence as supporting his submission that Klein did not know, before the event, that the deceased was to be murdered.  I have already referred to his second record of interview in which he said that he assumed that Milat was ""bullshitting"" when he talked earlier that day about killing the deceased.  The fact that Milat had, on at least one other occasion, made a threat of violence which he failed to carry out, was supported by the evidence of a Ms Miller during the sentencing proceedings.  There is also evidence that the next morning Klein showed clear signs of distress.  He was described by Milat's friend Damien as looking stressed.  His eyes were wide and he kept holding his stomach, then wrapping his arms up around his shoulders.
73In February 2012 Dr Olav Nielssen interviewed Klein at the request of his legal representatives.  Klein denied knowing that Milat was intending to kill the deceased or that Milat had an axe in the boot of his car.  He said that he recorded the incident on his telephone on the instructions of Milat.  He told Dr Nielssen that at the time of the killing both he and Day were frightened that Milat might kill them.
74On the basis of all this material, Mr Corr submits that a reasonable doubt must exist as to Klein's knowledge, before the event, that Milat was intending to murder the deceased.
75On the other hand, Klein was, in some highly relevant respects, less than honest and open in his records of interview.  In the first record of interview, of 22 November 2010, he said on three occasions that he did not know that Milat was going to do anything when they arrived at the Belanglo Forest, in particular that he did not know that Milat was planning to harm the deceased.  He said that when they were in the forest it was Milat who asked the deceased to get out of the car and come to the boot.
76In his second record of interview, dated 4 January 2011, Klein admitted that Milat had talked earlier on 20 November about wanting to kill the deceased, but Klein said that he did not believe him, thinking that Milat was ""bullshitting"".  During this record of interview he again said that it was Milat who asked the victim to get out of the car and come to the boot.  He was asked in his interview where his mobile phone was when he was in the car.  He said that it was in his pocket.  He denied making any audio or visual recording with his phone.
77I must assume that the lies told by Klein in the records of interview were deliberate ones.  No other reasonable explanation exists for the inconsistency between the accounts he gave in his first and second interview as to what Milat had previously said he intended to do in the Belanglo Forest.  Nor could Klein's assertions that it was Milat who called the deceased to the boot of the car be based on a faulty recollection.  Finally, Klein clearly knew that all of the events immediately leading up to the killing of the deceased were recorded on his telephone.  Indeed, as already mentioned, he was holding the telephone outside the car for the clear purpose of making this recording.
78The fact that Klein deliberately lied in relation to these important matters at the very least impacts adversely upon his credibility when he later made exculpatory statements as to his prior knowledge of Milat's intention to kill the deceased.
79Mr Corr relied on the fact that Klein was looking stressed the next day, 21 November, as supporting the proposition that the killing of the deceased had been an unexpected and traumatic event.  On the other hand, even if Klein had expected the deceased to be killed, the gruesomeness of the actual occurrences could easily have caused significant stress.  In the circumstances, I regard this as a relatively neutral piece of evidence.
80One of the unusual features of this offence was that it was committed in the presence of a fourth person, Chase Day.  Day was a friend of the deceased's, and Mr Corr relied upon the fact of his presence as rendering it unlikely that there was a prior agreement between Milat and Klein to kill the deceased.
81It is not entirely clear how it was that Day came to be with them that night.  Klein said in his second record of interview that when they went to collect the deceased, Day was with him, and the two of them got into the car.  Whether it was by pre-arrangement is not clear.
82In my view, the presence of Day in the car that night is in no way indicative of Klein's intentions when Milat collected the deceased and drove to Belanglo.  Whether the deceased was to be killed or merely assaulted, it was unusual that this was to be done in the presence of a fourth person.  Accordingly, I regard this also as a neutral piece of evidence.
83There is a clear body of evidence which supports the inferences urged by the Crown.  Much of this comes from the recording taken by Klein.  This recording clearly shows that it was Klein, not Milat, who called the deceased out to the boot of the car.  It was there, a short time later, that Milat struck the deceased in the torso with the axe.  The sound of the deceased crying out in agony is, to use Mr Stratton's word, chilling in the extreme.  By that time, if the intention had merely been to assault the deceased, the object had already been achieved.  Why, then, did Klein insist that Day get into the car and keep him there, presumably to stop him from interfering in what was happening between Milat and the deceased?  And why did Klein continue to record what was going on outside the car?  
84The whole of the evidence strongly supports the version of events submitted by the Crown.  Nevertheless, without the evidence of what was said in the car, a reasonable possibility might still have remained that Klein did not know, until the fatal blow was struck, that the injuring and tormenting of the deceased was destined to lead to his death.  A remote possibility might have existed that he thought that Milat's intention was to injure and humiliate the deceased, but not, in the end to kill him.  The two pieces of evidence which, in my view, close the door on this hypothesis are first, the conversation in which Klein told Day that Milat ""didn't want to murder two.""  (The ""two"" in this context is clearly the number two, not the word ""too"" meaning also).  This in my view is a clear indication that Klein already knew that Milat was intent on murder.  Similarly, when Day asked him:  ""Is he really going to kill him?""  Klein replied ""I think so.""  Again, this is not the response of a man who thought that Milat intended to injure, humiliate and taunt the deceased but then leave him alive.
85For all these reasons I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, when the four of them went into the Belanglo Forest, Klein knew that Milat's intention was to murder the deceased.
86I turn now to discuss others matters relevant to sentence in relation to both offenders, commencing with the offender Matthew Milat.
Milat - General sentencing considerations
87Milat, as already mentioned, was a little short of 18 years old at the time of this offence.  His birthday is on 29 December.  Accordingly he is now approximately 19 ½  years old.  His criminal history is extremely limited.  His sole prior conviction was for a mid-range PCA offence which was recorded only two days before the killing of the deceased, namely on 18 November 2010.  There is also evidence before the Court that, when he was about 14 years old, he sexually abused a 3 year old female relative.  However charges in relation to this matter were not proceeded with, and in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to take it into account in these proceedings.
88Two psychiatric reports were tendered in evidence relating to Milat, from Dr Furst and Dr David Greenberg.  From these reports, the following information emerges as to Milat's background.
89The offender grew up in the Moss Vale and Bargo area.  He was the only child of a union between his mother and a man from whom she separated a year later.  He has had very little contact with his natural father.  Not long after their separation his mother married his stepfather and had three children whom the offender apparently considers his siblings.  However, he had a turbulent relationship with his stepfather who on all accounts used to punish him excessively, and might have physically abused him.  Milat's academic performance at school was apparently average.  He was involved in sporting and other social activities, and on all accounts found it easy to make friends, at least on a superficial level.  At about the age of 14 he apparently started using cannabis and later taking other drugs.  Nevertheless, until one or two months before the offence, he was employed by a large company in the Newcastle area.  It was after losing his job that he returned to live in Bargo.  This was in October 2010, about one month before the offence.  
90At the age of 16, Milat commenced a relationship with Kirsty, and they have a daughter who is now two years old.  He started a relationship with another young person, Rachael, shortly before the current offence.  He has, of course, been in custody for the past 18 months.  During this time he has been in the juvenile detention system and has been starting to work towards his Higher School Certificate.  He has been subject to minimal disciplinary action.
91I turn now to discuss the psychiatric evidence in relation to Milat.  Dr Furst interviewed him at the Baxter Juvenile Justice Detention Centre on 3 May 2012 at the request of his legal representatives.  He commented that Milat had a lengthy history of substance abuse.  Dr Furst noted that there were no obvious signs of psychosis at the time of his interview.  Milat was articulate and presented as having at least average intelligence.  In response to a question as to whether Milat was suffering from any psychiatric or psychological condition, Dr Furst said that it was likely that he was dependent on drugs of abuse, particularly cannabis, amphetamines and the like at about the time of the offence.  Milat showed no signs of schizophrenia or psychotic illness at the time of his assessment by Dr Furst, nor did the doctor consider that he was suffering from a serious mental illness at the time of the offence.  Dr Furst expressed the opinion that Milat's abuse of drugs may well have had a destabilising effect on his mood and contributed to the level of anger he felt towards the deceased.  He considered that Milat might well have a degree of personality dysfunction.  He assessed Milat's risk of future violent offending as ""moderate"".
92Under the heading ""Diagnosis"", Dr Furst listed a ""substance use disorder"" (cannabis, amphetamines, alcohol) and ""possible drug induced psychosis"".  He also noted, ""Personality dysfunction not otherwise specified"".  
93Dr Greenberg saw Milat on 8 and 15 December 2010, and again on 8 June 2011.  When he wrote his report dated 21 May 2012 he had been provided with Dr Furst's report of 15 May 2012.  Dr Greenberg considered that Milat was an unreliable historian with regard to his use of illicit substances and alcohol.  He noted the varied accounts that Milat had given to different people as to his use of drugs generally, and particularly on the day of the offence.  Dr Greenberg agreed with Dr Furst that Milat was not suffering from any psychiatric illness, either at the time of the offence or during his later interviews.  However he had significant personality problems which were evident from his admiration of his uncle's past criminality, his planning of this offence, his lack of empathy with the victim's cries, and his subsequent gloating about the offence.  The doctor noted that these personality flaws are not dissimilar to those which are often described as psychopathy.  He noted that psychopathy is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis.  If it is present, psychiatrists tend to use the DSM classification, which is that of antisocial personality disorder.
94There was a degree of disagreement between Dr Furst and Professor Greenberg as to Milat's prospects of rehabilitation and the extent to which he poses a risk of future dangerousness.  Dr Furst considered that his risk of future violent offending is moderate.  This risk, the doctor commented, might also be reduced through Milat's engagement in a suitable program such as the Violent Offenders Treatment Program.  Professor Greenberg, whilst acknowledging that future risk is difficult to ascertain, regarded Milat's risk factor as much higher than that of the average person charged with a violent offence.  Professor Greenberg in his evidence acknowledged that Dr Furst had the advantage of interviewing Milat with particular reference to the issue of future offending.  Nevertheless he considered that Dr Furst's assessment of a moderate risk did not take into account all the personality issues relating to the offender or the nature of the offence itself.  
95A considerable amount of evidence was devoted to this issue of future dangerousness.  This is clearly a central issue to be determined in these proceedings.  Nevertheless I do not propose to go through the details of the risk profile assessments that were conducted in relation to Milat.  These generally related to adults, and therefore to people who were more likely to have been involved in the criminal justice system before they committed the particular offences which brought them before the court.  Accordingly these assessments are of limited value in relation to someone who was still a juvenile when he committed this offence.  In addition, the assessments produce actuarial results which fail to take into account the circumstances of the particular offence.  Dr Furst acknowledged that this was ""a big limitation"".
96An assessment of the offender Milat's future dangerousness is closely linked with the issue of remorse, to which I now turn.
97Over recent times Milat has purported to express remorse for the killing of the deceased and he has purported to apologise to the deceased's family members.  However, I am quite unable to accept that these are genuine expressions of remorse.  In my view they were written for forensic purposes only, and were not expressions of genuine regret.  They are entirely inconsistent with every other aspect of Milat's presentation following the commission of this offence.  In particular, the poems which he wrote whilst in custody some nine months after the offence were totally inconsistent with any regret or remorse about his actions.  In fact the opposite is the case; he almost appeared to revel in the memory of this terrible event.
98Both psychiatrists who interviewed Milat noted his lack of empathy.  This is entirely consistent with an absence of remorse.
99Reference has also been made to the drugs and alcohol apparently consumed by Milat earlier on the day of the killing.  His intoxication was, in one sense, relied upon by Mr Stratton as reducing his culpability for the offence.  However, as Dr Greenberg observed, Milat has been an unreliable historian with regard to his use of illicit drugs and alcohol.  He has given significantly divergent accounts of his drug taking, both in general and also on the day of the offence.  Accordingly I am unable to determine whether drugs and/or alcohol played any significant part in Milat's actions at the time.
100Having regard to whole of the evidence relating to this issue, I consider that Milat, with his personality dysfunctions and his lack of empathy, poses at best a substantial risk of violent re-offending.  In short, he remains a serious potential danger to the community.
101I now turn to the aggravating and mitigating factors as provided in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The following aggravating factors, which are not inherent in the offence itself, apply in relation to Milat.
The offence involved the actual use of a weapon (s 21A(2)(c)).  In this regard, the double bladed axe use by Milat to first injure and later kill the deceased was, as the Crown submits, most unusual and must have struck incredible fear in the heart of the deceased.
The offence was committed in company (s 21A(2)(e)).  The deceased was betrayed by two people whom he regarded as friends.  The fact that they acted in company clearly aggravated the seriousness of the offence.  The deceased had no opportunity whatsoever to escape.
The offence involved gratuitous cruelty (s 21A(2)(f)).  This is the most serious of the aggravating features of this offence.  The Crown referred to the deceased as being tortured and tormented.  Mr Stratton cavilled at the word ""tortured"", but in the extraordinary circumstances of this case I consider it an apt one.  For the last ten minutes of his life, when he was already seriously injured, the deceased was subjected to unimaginable torment by Milat.  It is virtually impossible to describe the horror of the deceased's circumstances during those last minutes.
The offence was a planned one (s 21A(2)(n)).  I have already discussed this issue.  It is perfectly clear that this was a cold blooded premeditated killing on the part of Milat.  
102It is also relevant here to discuss Milat's motive for committing this apparently senseless and brutal murder.  As already indicated, I completely reject any suggestion that the deceased himself did anything whatsoever to provoke Milat.  Given the whole of the circumstances, and particularly the fact that the killing of the deceased was graphically recorded on the co-offender's mobile phone, I can find no other motive than that submitted by the Crown, namely that this was a ""thrill kill"" on the part of Milat.  In other words, he took the life of an innocent young man, who was unfortunate enough to be his friend, in an unimaginably cruel, brutal and violent manner, solely for his own personal enjoyment.  That any person, who is not suffering from a psychiatric disorder, could behave in such a manner is almost inconceivable.  However, the evidence in this case all points in that direction.
103I turn now to the mitigating factors under s 21A.  There are no mitigating factors in relation to the offence.  There are however, two mitigating factors in relation to Milat himself.  These are, first, that he has no significant record of previous convictions and is therefore taken to have been a person of good character; second, that he entered a plea of guilty to this offence.  In this regard, Milat pleaded guilty to murder in the Children's Court and adhered to the plea when he was arraigned in this Court.  The Crown concedes that the plea was entered at the first available opportunity.  In the normal course of events it would therefore attract a significant discount on sentence.  However for reasons I will give later, I do not consider it appropriate to apply a discount in the case of this offender.
104In the extraordinary circumstances of this case, given all the matters I have mentioned, I consider that this case clearly falls within the worst category of cases of murder.
105Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a Court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.  Sub-s (6) provides that ""[t]his section does not apply to a person who was less than 18 years of age at the date of commission of the offence.""  It follows that, notwithstanding the extreme gravity of this offence, the Court retains a discretion to deal with it other than by imposing a sentence of life imprisonment.  In the present case, given the youth of the offender and the difficulty in predicting future dangerousness so far into the future, I propose to impose a determinate sentence.  However, in the extraordinary circumstances of this case, it must be an extremely lengthy one.
106Mr Stratton sought that I make an order under s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act enabling Milat to serve his sentence in a juvenile detention centre until he is 21, so that he might have the opportunity to complete his Higher School Certificate.  This opportunity does not exist, at least to the same extent, in adult gaols.  However given the fact that Milat was only a month short of his 18th birthday at the time he committed this offence, and given the very long sentence he will be serving, I do not think it appropriate for him to return, after sentence, to a juvenile detention centre.  Accordingly I decline to make such an order.
107At this point I return to discuss the consequences of Milat's plea of guilty.  It was entered after the police had discovered the recording of the killing on Klein's mobile phone.  The plea of guilty in these circumstances denotes a recognition of the reality of Milat's situation, rather than any indication of remorse.  Nevertheless, the utilitarian value of such a plea, in the normal course of events, would lead to a sentencing discount of between 10 and 25 per cent (R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383).  However, the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case recognised that in some circumstances the protection of the public requires such a long sentence to be imposed that no discount is appropriate.  The Crown submits that this is such a case.
108I cannot but concur with this proposition.  Taking into account the extreme gravity of the crime committed by Milat and the serious danger which he presents to the public I consider that the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty should not be productive of a reduction in sentence.
109I shall impose my formal sentence upon the offender Milat after discussing the sentencing considerations relating to his co-offender Klein, to which I now turn.
Klein - General sentencing considerations
110Klein was 18 at the time of the offence.  He was about three months older than Milat, but Milat was clearly the dominant personality of the two.
111Klein was the youngest of three boys in a family which appeared to have a strong work ethic.  He had an apparently stable childhood, living first at Greenacre and later at Bargo in the Southern Highlands.  He was an average student.  He left school part way through Year 10 and was employed in unskilled occupations for about half the time between then and his arrest.  As with Milat, his only previous convictions relate to driving matters when he was still a juvenile.  In July 2008 he was convicted of negligent driving and being an unlicensed driver for which he was fined and disqualified from driving for six months.
112Two psychiatric reports were tendered in Klein's case, from Dr Olav Nielssen and Professor David Greenberg.  However, Professor Greenberg did not have an opportunity to assess Klein personally.  Accordingly his report is restricted to the issue of future dangerousness, based only on a review of the relevant documentation.  This means that I have only Dr Nielssen's opinion relating to Klein's psychiatric condition.  Dr Nielssen also gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings.
113Klein told Dr Nielssen that he began drinking alcohol at around the age of 15, but was not a problem drinker.  At much the same time he also began taking cannabis and had been a daily cannabis smoker until the time of his arrest.  He had occasionally tried other drugs but his drug of choice was cannabis.  Dr Nielssen diagnosed him as suffering from substance abuse disorder which was then in remission, due to his detention in a largely drug free environment.  This diagnosis was made on the basis of Klein's accounts of experiencing paranoia and impaired mental performance associated with his use of drugs.
114There is no suggestion that Klein suffers from any psychiatric disorder.  Professor Greenberg considered that he had significant character or personality traits which had features of personality difficulties.  This was based, of course, on the documentary material, including the circumstances of the offence itself.
115It is difficult to determine to what extent, if any, Klein is remorseful for his participation in these offences.  He told Dr Nielssen that he had been severely affected by intrusive unwanted memories of the offence accompanied by disturbed sleep and anxiety symptoms.  After taking medication these symptoms had abated.  In one sense, this could be taken as an indication of remorse.  Dr Nielssen considered that Klein's drug use was a major contribution to his loss of judgment around the time of this offence.  Klein said that on release from custody he no longer intended to use drugs.  On this basis Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion that Klein can be ""successfully rehabilitated to a productive and law abiding way of life.""
116It is pertinent to note, however, that during his interview with Dr Nielssen, Klein continued to minimise his role in the offence, saying that he did not believe that Milat would actually carry out the killing as he had said he would.  Dr Nielssen agreed in cross-examination that, if Klein's role was in fact as substantial as was put to him by the Crown, then it would suggest that Klein was a more callous and perhaps antisocial person that he had previously considered, which would in turn influence his prospects of rehabilitation.
117Professor Greenberg's report, dated 20 May 2012, was based upon the available documentary material, including Dr Nielssen's report of 18 March.  Professor Greenberg noted that Klein had given contradictory information with regard to his cannabis use on the day of the killing.  In his first record of interview, he stated that he was sober and not on drugs that day.  In his second interview on 4 January 2011 he said that he had been smoking cannabis that morning.
118Professor Greenberg also noted that there was no mention of remorse during Klein's interview with Dr Nielssen.  Klein was at all times in that interview trying to minimise his role in the offence.  In Professor Greenberg's opinion Klein's drug use, although a disinhibiting factor in his judgment, could not in itself explain his behaviour on this occasion.  The Professor considered that Klein has character or personality problems with antisocial features which provide a partial explanation for his involvement in the killing of the deceased.
119Finally Professor Greenberg noted that it is difficult to make meaningful long term predictions about dangerousness given Klein's youth and the limited available evidence.  He was, as he put it, more cautious than Dr Nielssen in his assessment of Klein's prospects of rehabilitation.
120My conclusion in relation to Klein's prospects of rehabilitation is as follows.  I do not accept that drugs played a significant role in his behaviour on the day of the killing.  They might have clouded his judgment to some extent, but not enough to markedly reduce his culpability.  He was not suffering from any psychiatric illness at the time, although he had personality defects which contributed to his role in the killing.  His continued denials as to the extent of his role is, in one sense, inconsistent with genuine remorse.  On the other hand, he is almost certainly an impressionable young man who was strongly influenced by his co-offender Milat.  He has no previous record of any offence of violence.  This being the case I would assess his prospects of rehabilitation as at least moderate and possibly more favourable.  This, of course, is a highly significant matter on sentence.
121I turn now to the aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A of the sentencing legislation.  The same aggravating factors apply in relation to Klein as do in relation to Milat, namely:
The offence involved the use of a weapon.  Klein denied knowing that Milat had the axe in the boot of the car.  However, in the light of his other denials relating to matters which are now firmly established, it is difficult to reach any firm conclusion as to whether he knew that this particular axe was in the car.  Given that their joint intention that night was to kill the deceased, Klein must have realised that some form of weapon was available to Milat.
The offence was committed in company.  In this regard it was Klein who provided the support for Milat during the course of this killing, first by occupying Day and ensuring that he remained in the car, and also by recording the horrific circumstances leading up to the final blow.  
The offence involved gratuitous cruelty.  I have already referred to the almost inconceivable torment and torture suffered by the deceased in the last ten minutes of his life.  This was directly at the hands of Milat, not Klein. I think that it is very possible that the actual level of torment and humiliation inflicted upon the victim was greater than Klein had anticipated.  This would do much to explain his symptoms of stress the following day.  Accordingly, whilst this is an extremely serious aggravating factor in the case of both offenders, it is much more significant in the case of Milat, who actually inflicted the cruelty, than in the case of Klein.
The offence was planned.  I have already given my ruling that Klein well knew, when they went to the Belanglo Forest, that Milat was intending to murder the deceased.
122Before I turn to any mitigating factors, I should conclude my assessment as to the level of the seriousness of the offence of murder, as committed by Klein.  In my view it falls well within the serious range.  I am not satisfied, however, as the Crown urges, that Klein was himself expecting to get a thrill out of the killing of the deceased.  I consider it likely that he was significantly under the influence of Milat when he agreed to go with him, assist in the killing of the deceased and also to record it.  This recording was probably for the future edification of Milat, rather than of Klein.  Klein's culpability is of a significantly lower degree than that of Milat, but it is still well within the serious range of culpability.  
123There are no mitigating factors relevant to the offence itself.  As to mitigating factors relevant to the offender, the same factors apply to the offender Klein as did to Milat.  Klein has no significant record of previous convictions and is therefore taken to be a person of good character.  He pleaded guilty to murder in the Local Court.  This was the first available opportunity and in his case he is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea.  The Crown submitted, and I accept, that the utility of the plea has been somewhat diminished by the disputed facts which necessitated the playing in court of traumatic portions of the recording of the murder.  In these circumstances I consider that the discount attributable to the plea should be towards the lower end of the range of discounts, which is from 10 to 25 per cent.  The sentence I am about to impose has been adjusted accordingly.
124Finally I turn to deal with a few general matters which relate to both offenders.
125Both of them are still very young:  only 19 ½ years old.  This is clearly a relevant matter throughout the sentencing process.
126The standard non-parole period for murder is 20 years imprisonment.  However for the murder of a child under 18 years of age it is 25 years imprisonment.  The standard non-parole period is now to be used as a guide only (Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120).  Mr Corr submitted, and I accept, that the higher standard non-parole period for the killing of a child is attributable to the fact that a child is likely to be a defencelessness victim.  In the present case, although technically still a child, the deceased was a fully grown male who was only a year younger than the two offenders.  In these circumstances, the rationale for extending the standard non-parole period beyond the normal 20 years is significantly reduced.  I accept this to be the case, and in so far as I am deferring to the standard non-parole period, I will take this into account.  
127Extremely moving victim impact statements were read in court by members of the deceased's family:  his mother, Donna Locke, his father, also David Auchterlonie, his grandfather, again also David Auchterlonie and his grandmother Sandra Auchterlonie.  These eloquently expressed the horror and grief suffered by the family and friends of young David Auchterlonie, given his underserved and unexpected death and the terrible circumstances surrounding it.  I would like to express my personal condolences and those of the Court for the loss of their loved one.  I take these statements into account in the manner provided by the legislation.
128The Crown does not dispute that special circumstances exist in the case of both offenders which justify a departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence.  The special circumstances are:  the youth of the offenders, the fact that this is their first term of imprisonment, and the likelihood that they will need a lengthy period of supervision upon their release from custody.
129Both offenders have been in custody since the 22 November 2010 and their sentences are to commence on that date.
SENTENCE
130Matthew Milat for the offence of murdering David Auchterlonie I sentence you to imprisonment to be served by way of a non-parole period of 30 years to commence on 22 November 2010 and to expire on 21 November 2040.  The balance of the term of your sentence will be 13 years to commence on 22 November 2040 and to expire on 21 November 2053.  The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 21 November 2040.
131Cohen Klein for the offence of murdering David Auchterlonie I sentence you to imprisonment to be served by way of a non-parole period of 22 years to commence on 22 November 2010 and to expire on 21 November 2032.  The balance of the term of your sentence will be 10 years to commence on 22 November 2032 and to expire on 21 November 2042.  The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 21 November 2032.

2759446,R v Lou TASICH [2012] NSWDC 96,"Judgment
Application for pre-trial rulings
1At the outset of the proceedings counsel for the Accused filed a Notice of Motion seeking:
(a)that the evidence sought by the Crown to be adduced against the accused be regarded as the subject of issue estoppel. 
That was altered during the course of argument to seek, in the alternative, a stay of these proceedings as an abuse of process.
(b)that the trial of the accused be by judge-alone rather than a jury trial. 
At the end of submissions that was no longer pressed.
2I have rejected both applications. These are my reasons for that decision.
Indictment
3On 13 June 2012, the accused was arraigned on an indictment, with the following counts:
1. On 19 September 2007, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, at a compulsory examination conducted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, gave false evidence in a material particular, namely, that at lunch meetings with Peter Coyte at which Wollongong City Council car parks were discussed, Peter Coyte had solicited a corrupt benefit from him, the said Lou Tasich knowing the statement to be false.
2. On 27 September 2007, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, at a compulsory examination conducted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, gave false evidence in a material particular, namely, that he, in March 2007, had complained to Noreen Hay that Peter Coyte had sought a corrupt benefit from him, the said Lou Tasich knowing the statement to be false.
3. On 27 September 2007, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, at a compulsory examination conducted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, gave false evidence in a material particular, namely, that he, in February 2007, had complained to Frank Gigliotti that Peter Coyte had sought a corrupt benefit from him, the said Lou Tasich knowing the statement to be false.
All these charges have been laid under section 87(1) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988; Law Part Code: 56822.
Crown case
4The prosecution alleges that the accused gave false evidence to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in a material particular on three occasions: namely, 19 September 2007 and 27 September 2007 (twice). The count relating to 19 September 2007 concerns an allegation made by the accused that Mr Coyte had solicited a bribe from the accused. The counts relating to 27 September 2007 allege the accused had stated, first, to Noreen Hay and second, to Frank Gigliotti that Coyte had sought a corrupt benefit from the accused.
5The allegations relate to a proposed development of a car-park owned by the Wollongong City Council. Mr Coyte was the relevant divisional manager at the Wollongong Council. Mr Tasich was a developer interested in development projects. Ms Hay was an MP for the Wollongong area. Mr Gigliotti was a Wollongong City Council councillor.
Relevant procedural history
6The accused was relevantly first arraigned on an indictment of 7 November 2011, on one count of corruptly offer a financial benefit to Mr Peter Coyte on 2 May 2007, contrary to s 249B(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The earlier trial, on which the accused was acquitted, related to what was alleged by the Crown to be an attempt by the accused to bribe Mr Coyte with a note containing the words ""30K 4 U"". Mr Coyte gave evidence that he had received a note from Mr Tasich to that effect. Mr Tasich denied that he had done that.
7The bribery trial before a jury proceeded on 7-9, 14-8 and 21 November 2011. The accused was found not guilty.
8A second indictment containing three counts of giving false evidence at a compulsory examination before ICAC was originally dated 18 March 2011. That is the same as the indictment now before the Court and on which the accused has now been arraigned.  
Application for stay of proceedings
9Counsel for the accused, Mr Wendler, submits that Mr Tasich's evidence in the first trial was in conflict with the evidence of Mr Coyte. Given that the jury acquitted Mr Tasich after considering that conflict, Mr Wendler submits that the evidence sought to be adduced should be regarded as being the subject of issue estoppel in that the jury verdict ""...settled issues sought again to be ventilated by evidence relied on in the prosecution of the current indictment."" In the alternative, Mr Wendler submits that proceeding with an indictment with that evidence constituted an abuse of process.
Evidence
10Mr Wendler relied on a Notice of Motion and a supporting affidavit from Ms B Green, solicitor. Mr Wendler also referred me to various passages of the transcript of the earlier trial and what will be led against the accused in this trial to base his submission that there is such a commonality of evidence that the jury's verdict means that the issue of Mr Tasich's evidence should be accepted on those matters.
11I have had regard to the closing address from the Crown Prosecutor at the earlier trial and the extracts of the summing up by the trial judge, His Honour Judge Norrish QC.
Submissions
Accused
12During the hearing of the application, Mr Wendler varied the basis of the application to one of an abuse of process which he submitted should be stayed in accordance with his earlier submission that an issue estoppel arose. During the course of submissions there was an examination of the authorities - see below - where the existence of a doctrine of issue estoppel in criminal proceedings was doubted.
13The accused submits that these proceedings are oppressive, and that the Director, by proceeding with this indictment is simply investigating a controversy which has been finalised. Fundamental to this submission is that the controversy has been fully ventilated and examined in the earlier trial and that issues relevant to issue estoppel and abuse of process are relevant in the exercise of my discretion in this case.
14Mr Wendler submits that the jury's verdict in the earlier trial must be taken to have been a clear indication of the jury's determination of the issue of credibility between Mr Tasich and the principal Crown witness, Mr Coyte. He submits that the two witnesses were the only witnesses of substance and that the jury must be taken to have disbelieved Mr Coyte. The commonality of the evidence is said to be that the accused told ICAC that Mr Coyte had sought a corrupt benefit from the accused and that evidence was repeated in the trial. Further, that both Ms Hay (relevantly to the second count) and Mr Gigliotti (relevantly to the third count) gave evidence in the earlier trial and that the jury implicitly accepted Mr Tasich's account. It is submitted that the jury made an assessment of the totality of the evidence including the evidence concerning the allegations said to have been made to Ms Hay and Mr Gigliotti.
15Mr Wendler further submits that the jury's findings on credit - even if inferential - have ""merged into the verdict"" such that there is an issue estoppel. In the alternative, he submits that the verdict gives rise to a requirement that the proceedings be stayed. Further, that there was, by the earlier trial, a settlement of the issues - namely, adversely as to Mr Coyte's credit - such that his evidence cannot be relied on in the prosecution of the current indictment. He submits that the relevant witnesses were called in the earlier proceedings; further, that the judge in that earlier trial summed up on the relevant areas of evidence and the conflicts between Mr Tasich and Mr Coyte, leading to the inference that the jury must have considered and determined those issues.
16I have asked Mr Wendler for authority to support his essential proposition, namely, that a finding of credibility of a witness in relation to a Crown witness can be established from an earlier jury verdict such as to mean that the Crown cannot rely on that same witness in separate proceedings involving separate and distinct charges and different events.  
17Mr Wendler has referred me to Gilham v R [2007] NSWCCA 323; (2007) 73 NSWLR 308 at [8] ff. In particular, he refers me to a passage quoted there from Island Maritime Ltd v Filipowski [2006] HCA 30; (2006) 226 CLR 328 at [43] to the effect that the principle is one of autrefois acquit, namely, that the Crown is estopped from re-asserting the guilt of the accused when that question has previously been asserted - and determined - against the Crown.
Judge alone trial
18Mr Wendler submits that the public interest would be best served by a judge alone trial where matters of notoriety and controversy would be able to be put aside by a judge. His case is that, no matter what directions were given, a jury would be likely to be influenced by the subject matter of the dispute. Mr Wendler submits that ICAC matters impart a flavour to proceedings which are prejudicial to an accused in these circumstances.
Crown
19The Crown submits that the applications should be rejected. 
20In the earlier trial the Crown asserted that the accused offered a bribe to Mr Coyte in May 2007. In this trial the Crown will be asserting something different, namely, that the accused when examined by ICAC, said that Mr Coyte offered him, the accused, a bribe in February 2007. 
21It will be alleged in relation to Count 2 that during a lunch meeting in February 2007, the accused said that Mr Coyte solicited a bribe from him. Mr Coyte's evidence will be that that never happened. The evidence will be that at the ICAC hearing the accused told Ms Hay in the presence of Ms McMahon that in March 2007 Mr Coyte had tried to solicit a bribe from him. Ms Hay will say that it was not until July 2007 that she first heard that Mr Coyte had allegedly solicited a bribe.
22Count 3 will be based on Mr Gigliotti's evidence that it was not until early June that the accused had made a complaint of an attempt to solicit a bribe from him. The Crown will refer to a series of meetings culminating in a meeting on 2 May 2007. On 31 May 2007 Wollongong Council sent a letter to the accused refusing to have anything to do with him given Mr Coyte's allegation of 2 May 2007.
23The Crown case was that, knowing an allegation had been made against him of bribery, the accused made a counter-assertion against Mr Coyte with an erroneous and false chronology, to deliberately blacken Mr Coyte's name or at least to deflect attention from his own actions. On the Crown case, this was not a case of a mistake as to a date but was rather a deliberate and false account given to ICAC in circumstances where the accused knew the false material was both important to the Commission's determination and serious in its content.
Judge alone trial
24The Crown opposes a judge alone trial on the basis that this is a matter where the public interest would be served by findings being made by a jury on credibility on a matter of public importance and controversy. The Crown also notes that the earlier trial resulted in an acquittal. Accordingly, it is submitted that the fact that a matter is the subject of ICAC inquiries would not overawe a jury such that it would not carry out its functions as directed nor objectively consider the evidence.
25The Crown further submits that the earlier proceedings were of a different nature and no issue estoppel nor abuse of process arises.
Law
Issue estoppel 
26Mr Wendler refers to the decision of Mraz v R (No 2) (1956) 96 CLR 62 to submit that in this case there is a substantial consistency between the verdict of acquittal on the earlier account and the allegations made or which will be made in the course of the trial on the current indictment. Mraz v R involved the determination of whether on a rape trial, an earlier acquittal of a murder arising out of the same facts, an acquittal (of murder) had determined the issue of whether the jury in the earlier trial must have of necessity found the accused not guilty of rape.
27In R v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364, the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal found that an earlier acquittal on an abduction charge meant that subsequent evidence of resistance in a rape trial should have been rejected as inconsistent with the decided issue in the earlier trial. 
28There was a division in the High Court on the consideration of the application of the principle of issue estoppel. Mr Wendler submits that the rule, which is based on the principle against double jeopardy, is of wider application than the autrefois acquit rule such that it will apply even where the charges are different in each trial. It will apply where the Crown in the second trial seeks to prove the facts which are in fact or in effect the essential ingredients of the earlier charge.
Judge alone trial
29S132(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides:""If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by judge alone the Court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.""
30The factors to which reference may be made in assessing the ""interests of justice"" in a particular case are not exhaustively categorized anywhere, but s 132(5) provides the following limited guidance:""Without limiting subs (4) the Court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including but not limited to an issue of reasonableness, negligence and indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.""
31I have also taken into account the matters set out in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86.
Consideration
Timing of pre-trial applications
32This matter was set down for trial in November 2011. The applications were made just prior to the jury being empanelled, 12 June 2012. To the extent that the accused seeks a stay based on an abuse of process, I note that this separate indictment was filed in March 2011. No application has been made since that time to raise these issues.
33In response to the concern as to why the application was not made earlier, Mr Wendler said that the accused's solicitor made representations to the DPP six weeks ago. Those were not responded to until last week. In the interim it was said that no Crown Prosecutor had been allocated to the matter and the accused's submissions could not be considered.
34Whatever the situation with the DPP, there is no reason why that application could not have been the subject of a separate Notice of Motion brought before this court at a much earlier date. The accused has been legally represented throughout. There is no reason why such a Notice of Motion could not have been filed in sufficient time to be mentioned in the course of the normal case management procedures of this Court before the Chief Judge or the List Judge. In that regard, I note that the time period of 28 days specified in s 132A of the Criminal Procedure Act was not complied with. On the material before me there is no reason why leave should be granted.
Issue estoppel
35I do not accept that the doctrine of issue estoppel applies to criminal trials. I note the comments in Rogers v R [1994] HCA 42; (1994) 181 CLR 251 at [2] and of McClellan CJ at CL in Gilham v R at [144]. However, even if I am wrong on that, there is no authority of which I am aware which supports the proposition earlier relied on by Mr Wendler. Nor am I aware of any authority that an acquittal in an earlier trial following a contest of evidence between two witnesses necessarily means that a subsequent tribunal of fact is prevented from determining a similar contest of credibility between those two witnesses - especially where, as here, there are different charges and different issues of fact.
36If what is now argued constitutes an abuse of process based on the giving of identical evidence in two trials, I do not consider that the accused has established the grounds to support that application.
37These are separate and different charges (three counts of giving false evidence to ICAC) compared to an offering of a bribe. There are clearly different elements in relation to the different indictments. Certainly the Crown will have to consider the falsity of the statements made by the accused to ICAC on each of the counts in relation to the particulars alleged and the times alleged.
38The factual matters relate to different events and time periods. The charges in this trial are brought under different legislation compared to that in the first trial. 
39I do not accept the interpretation nor the inevitability of the conclusion from the jury's verdict as urged on me by Mr Wendler. Nor do I accept that the jury's verdict was such that the Crown is now estopped from re-asserting the conduct of the accused in this second trial. There are a variety of different reasons why the jury could have come to the verdict it did. Those could include, for example, that they did not believe Mr Tasich but were not satisfied on the evidence of Mr Coyte or that they were not satisfied that the other elements for those offences had been proved.
40Mr Wendler has referred me to various authorities which relate to the law of double jeopardy. In short summary, the latter authorities make it clear that the Crown may not challenge the ultimate result in a previous trial where there was an acquittal. The Crown is clearly not seeking to do that here - rather the Crown is relying on the evidence given by the accused before ICAC to show that the complaints the accused made in his examination were false.
41I do not find that the first trial has resolved all the issues to be determined in this trial.
42While the earlier trial concluded the contest of evidence as between Mr Tasich and Mr Coyte on those matters in relation to the count on that indictment, what the present trial will deal with are different events and statements, not previously resolved against the Crown by earlier proceedings.
Judge alone trial
43The earlier proceedings were conducted before a jury and resulted in an acquittal.  I do not accept that there is any, let alone any inevitable, prejudice arising from the fact of a trial involving ICAC matters and discussions of the nature to be relied on by the Crown and disputed by the accused. 
44Here the Crown will be suggesting that there has been a deliberate attack on public officials who are in senior Local Government positions of influence and where the allegations concern conversations with elected officials. There will be disputed accounts to be given by two Members of Parliament, one of whom remains a Member. That element and those conversations are strongly disputed in this case. In my view, it is an important matter for the administration of justice that the truth or otherwise of such purported attacks need to be determined in open court by the community as represented by the jury. So too associated issues of credibility of, and attacks on, public and elected officials should be determined by a jury in accordance with established community standards. 
45The aspect of a suggested deliberate misrepresentation to an inquisitorial body such as ICAC also may need to be considered by a jury. In my view the public interest requires that issues arising out of prior ICAC inquiries - where there can be issues of secrecy and confidentiality in the conduct of closed inquiries - need to be resolved openly. 
46These matters - particularly that of maintaining the public confidence in the criminal justice system and the legitimation of the operation of the criminal law by jury hearings - have been referred to in R v Belghar per McClellan CJ at CL at [97].
47In determining what is in the interests of justice overall, I take into account the matters I have specified and the existing situation against which the recent changes to the Criminal Procedure Act have been introduced. As was pointed out by Woods DCJ in R v GSR [2011] NSW DC 17, most major criminal trials in New South Wales are conducted by a jury of twelve civilians randomly drawn from the community, and this is a long respected mode of trial. The merits and benefits of trial by jury should be borne steadily in mind in determining an application such as this. It is an important factor - as are the wishes of the accused. Here the Crown opposes a Judge alone trial, in my view for good reasons.
48Under common law trial by jury, the accused has the right peremptorily to challenge members of a jury panel. The law has traditionally regarded it as important that the accused have some stake in a process which may lead to him being convicted and put into gaol. Trials are by jury. This is a long and valued mode of trial. There is not a presumption in favour of a jury trial but it is a significant consideration not to be disregarded lightly.
Ruling
49I reject both applications.
Orders
50The trial on all counts will proceed before a jury.

		13 July 2012",2012-06-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2759447,Lindsay v R [2012] NSWCCA 124,"Judgment

1ALLSOP P: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by the District Court on 20 May 2011 in respect of the applicant's conviction in respect of an offence contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth), s 307.2(1) of importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug. The drug was cocaine. The applicant had over 400 grams (352.1 grams pure) of cocaine hidden on his person. He was stopped and questioned at Sydney airport after disembarking a flight from Bangkok on 6 August 2010. He pleaded guilty. A marketable quantity of cocaine for s 307.2(1) was two grams to two kilograms. The maximum penalty for the offence was 25 years imprisonment.

2He was sentenced on 20 May 2011 to a term of imprisonment of a non-parole period of five years six months with a balance of term of three years.

3The facts are set out in the applicant's written submissions at paragraphs 5 to 13. I will refer to them as necessary below.

4The matter came before this Court on Monday 21 May 2012. Written submissions had been filed in support of the sole ground of appeal, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. An application for an adjournment to Wednesday 23 May was granted on the basis of inconvenience to counsel due to family matters. New counsel appeared on 23 May with additional written submissions. Those submissions were directed to a specific point not referred to in the grounds of appeal: that a finding of duress, falling short of the legal defence of duress, should have been made and in the absence of such a finding no proper weight was given to this matter in the assessment of the criminality of the offence. No objection was taken by the Crown to the variation in argument based on the form of the grounds of appeal filed.

5In my view, there are no real prospects of success of demonstrating that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

6The findings of the learned sentencing judge noted that there was a degree of planning, that while there was a lack of clarity about the true role of the applicant, he was not a mere courier and his involvement included booking his travel and his hotel accommodation and that he was 44 and had a lengthy criminal history including offences involving drugs, stealing and dishonesty.

7Considerable weight was placed by original counsel for the applicant on the categorisation of Commonwealth drug offences by the Chief Judge at Common Law in De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 205 A Crim R 1. It was said that the applicant fell into the third of the Chief Judge's categories, not the second. The range of sentences for this (third) category (thematically described as involving lower quantities, monetary reward or relief of debts, guilty pleas, mere courier role and adverse personal circumstances) was a head sentence of 3.75 to 6 years and a non-parole period of 2 to 4.25 years.

8Two things can be said immediately about this approach. First, although the applicant conceded that the Chief Judge's categories in De La Rosa were not legally binding, the submissions really worked on that hypothesis. The categorisation in De La Rosa should not be used as anything other than general guidance and assistance. The categories are not binding. Secondly, the overall criminality of the offence involves an evaluative assessment of all factors. If one were to characterise the offence by reference to the Chief Judge's categories, it is more than arguable that, given his role was something more than being a mere courier, in particular because of his participation, to a degree, in the planning of the offence, the applicant fell within the second category. That category had a range of head sentence of six to nine years with a non-parole period of three to just over five years.

9Thus analysed, I would not have granted leave.

10The additional submissions had more force. Central to the applicant's case on sentence was the assertion that he and members of his family in England had been threatened with violence by those behind the enterprise. These threats were said to have their genesis in an unpaid drug debt of some £6,000. Initially, on the first day of the sentencing hearing, 8 April 2011, the applicant attempted to provide substantiating evidence of this by the tender of an email letter from his sister in England. The tender was rejected. Her Honour said on that occasion that it touched upon ""important issues"" and that ""some other avenue of putting the evidence before the Court be explored"". Whilst that evidence was not led on that day, the applicant gave oral evidence, upon which he was cross-examined, about the drug debt, the alleged intimidation and other matters relevant to his sentence. 

11It was submitted in the additional submissions that it was not put to the applicant in cross-examination that there was no pressure exerted upon him in the nature that he contended. This is not the case. During his cross-examination there were questions which challenged the veracity of his evidence about the duress. For instance, it was put to him that he had not told the social worker who prepared a report that his family had been threatened, but rather he had stated that the reason why he undertook to import cocaine was to pay off drug debts. In a body of transcript which, on its face, reflects a degree of evasion, the applicant's explanation for this was that he was not asked that question. There are also questions of him by counsel for the Crown and the judge about the fact that he did not inform the police of his family being threatened. Nevertheless, when the matter resumed on 20 May 2011 two affidavits were read without objection. The first of those affidavits was of the applicant's sister and the second of his mother. The applicant's sister said, amongst other things, the following:

""6.Before Angus left England, I had received threats from some people who were after my brother stating that he owed them some money. I had some phone calls from a man whose voice I did not recognize, on approximately 28th June 2010, stating that if Angus did not get some money he owed them they would harm us. As best as I can recall, he said 'You know where your brother is, tell him we want our money or someone is going to get hurt'. I disconnected the call. I was worried as I did not know how he had got my number.

7.I had a man come to my house and threaten me and my son on approximately 5th July 2010 at about 2130 to 2200 hrs, I recall it was getting dark outside. He said 'If you do not tell Angus to get us our money we will come and fire bomb your house'.

8.The man was approximately 5'10"" with short brown hair. He was thin and was very agitated and hostile. He demanded my son give him his mobile phone stating 'I know you are speaking to him and that you know where he is'. I gave him my son's mobile and he checked his contact number list however the number listed for Angus was not working. He then demanded that I tell him Angus's whereabouts, I said 'He is out of the country but I don't have an exact address'. He accused me of lying and said 'I know these people are serious, they are not people you want to mess with, they will come here and fire bomb your house or go to your mum's, we know where she lives'. During this conversation the man was shouting and agitated he also told us 'Don't tell the police'. I didn't report the incident to the police as I was frightened this may exacerbate the situation. I knew my mother had previously had someone at her house and that she had felt intimidated.

9.I told my brother, about this incident and was angry with him telling him he had endangered his family and shortly afterwards I heard he had committed this crime.

10.My mother had also spoken to my brother about the contacts with her and with myself.

11.All the dates and times are approximate as it was a stressful time.

12.I feel that he took this action as a means of trying to protect his family. As I have previously stated I think that Angus would take any action to protect us.

13.These people are reportedly dangerous people who I genuinely felt would harm us. I believed that they might even attempt to kill us due to the fire bomb threat. We are not a family with money to assist him as we all work in the public service. Angus was aware of this.

14.I know that Angus is distressed by the fact that this will mean he cannot see our mother for quite some time as she is too elderly to make the trip to Australia.""

12The applicant's mother said the following, amongst other things:

""6.Before Angus left England in July 2010, I had received threats from some people who were after my son stating that he owed them some money. I had some phone calls on approximately 28th June 2010 in the evening stating that if Angus did not get some money he owed them they would harm me. As best as I can recall, he said 'He had better get our money or someone will get hurt'. I took this to mean that either Angus, myself or another member of my family were being threatened. I was very upset and frightened. I told my son this and he felt it would be safer for us and him if he left our address and Town. Shortly afterwards he left the UK.

7.On approximately 3th [sic] July 2010 a man came to my home during the late afternoon, he was tall and balding, he asked where my son was and when I said 'I don't know', he said 'I know you do. Why are you lying?' I again said 'I don't have his address' and the man left.

8.Not long after this my eldest daughter and her son, my grandson were also threatened. I told Angus when he rang me. He was very worried about our safety.

9.Later I heard he had committed this crime.""

13These affidavits had been given to the Crown beforehand. Objection to their admissibility was not taken. The Crown did submit, however, that the Court should give consideration to the fact that it was unable to test the evidence of the sister and mother as they were unavailable for cross-examination and that the evidence should be given reduced weight to that extent. 

14The judge then proceeded to sentence the applicant. In her Honour's remarks on sentence the following appears:

""This offender, through the evidence tendered to this Court by way of affidavits from his sister and his mother and through other statements made by him since his arrest, contends that his involvement in this offence was almost out of his control, that is, he committed the offence under duress. He contends that he was forced by a drug debt of some 6,000 pounds to commit this offence. Whether or not he did owe such a debt, and I accept to some extent there were people after him for money, it does not really assist him in mitigating the motivation for him committing this offence. The amount of 6,000 pounds, to someone who has been unemployed for a period of six or seven years is no doubt a large sum of money. If it were the case that he owed a debt of that magnitude, it would have been difficult for him to obtain that kind of money. However, to make the claim that the only way that he could solve the problem of the drug debt was by engaging or becoming involved in this importation does not really assist him. In relation to a debt of that kind, there were other options available to this offender including, perhaps, borrowing money from his mother or members of his family who seemed to have incomes and are supportive of him, or borrowing from another source. Furthermore, I have some slight reservations as to the pressing nature of this debt given that his first concern expressed to the police when interviewed formally was that he did not want to spend his time in prison known as an informer. His concerns for the threats to his family seem somewhat secondary to that. At any rate it does not matter a great deal whether he was motivated by a past debt for drugs or whether it was a present need for money for drugs, there were other avenues, open to him other than being involved in the importation of this large quantity of cocaine into this country.

...

In sentencing the offender, his early plea of guilty is taken into account and a twenty-five per cent discount is allowed for the utilitarian benefit of that plea. The present offence is not an aberration as he has past drug related offences on his record. One offence attracted a four-year sentence of imprisonment in England and, as such, must have been significantly serious. His personal drug addiction provides nothing in the way of mitigation for an offence as serious as this. As I have already indicated, it was a premeditated act committed for a financial gain of sorts, either to pay off a debt or for some other purpose.""


15The applicant submitted that there was uncontradicted evidence of threats to the family. That is putting the matter too high. The Crown submissions as to the inability to cross-examine had a degree of force. It is tolerably plain from the remarks on sentence that the sentencing judge was not particularly impressed by the evidence of the applicant. Her Honour took into account the evidence of the sister and mother. What she was not persuaded of, partly because of the lack of reliability of the applicant's evidence, and partly because of the size of the asserted drug debt, was that the pressure of his ""creditors"" was truly pressing on him as a motivation to commit this crime. She remarked that his first concern expressed to the police was that he did not want to spend his time in Australia in prison as an informer and that his concerns for the threats to his family seem somewhat secondary to that. Thus, the uncross-examined evidence of the mother and sister does not necessitate a finding that these matters were what weighed on the applicant. What weighed on the applicant depended upon his evidence and its acceptance by the sentencing judge having seen him. 

16In these circumstances, it is not correct to say that her Honour failed to make a finding which she was bound to make.

17Reliance was placed upon a number of cases, but in particular Tiknius v R [2011] NSWCCA 215. Nothing in Tiknius required any firmer or more precise finding on so-called duress that was favourable to the applicant. The sentencing judge considered all evidence led on behalf of the applicant and expressed herself in a manner that did not leave out of account any factual consideration nor leave unfound any fact necessary and required to be found. 

18Indeed, the judgment of Johnson J in Tiknius (with whom Tobias AJA and Hall J agreed) has remarks in it which do not assist the applicant. The consideration of general deterrence in offences of this kind is significant. It can be taken that those behind drug importations may well often groom or pressure persons of weaker will to carry out the tasks of the actual importation and undergo the risk of detection. That has been referred to as an unremarkable feature of many importation offences. Courts should be astute not to permit general deterrence to be diluted by the claim of some threats or intimidation. Of course, every case must be examined on its own particular facts and the evidence led. That is precisely what the learned sentencing judge did on this occasion. 

19In my view, no error of the sentencing judge has been demonstrated. There was sufficient ground, in my view, to warrant leave to appeal being granted on the matters raised in the supplementary submissions but the appeal should be dismissed. Orders that I would make would be:

1.Grant leave to appeal on the issues raised in the supplementary written submissions dated 23 May 2012, otherwise leave to appeal refused.

2.Appeal dismissed.

21SCHMIDT J: I agree with Allsop P.

		14 June 2012",2012-06-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759448,R v Rafael RODRIGUEZ [2012] NSWSC 663,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1The offender, Rafael Rodriguez, was tried before me upon an indictment charging him as an accessory after the fact to an offence of murder said to have been committed by his son, Abraham Rodriguez.  The jury found him not guilty of that offence but guilty as an accessory after the fact to manslaughter.  He stands for sentence for that offence.
Facts
2On 24 August 1995, Abraham Rodriguez and a juvenile, HT, robbed a 16 year old schoolboy at Lidcombe.  Abraham Rodriguez had a knife and, in the course of the robbery, he stabbed the unfortunate victim, causing a wounding which proved to be fatal.
3In the following month Abraham Rodriguez left Australia, and has never returned.  The juvenile was also tried before me, in his case for murder and robbery in company with wounding.  He was found guilty of manslaughter and robbery in company simpliciter.  I sentenced him for those offences on 11 April 2012, and a brief description of the circumstances of the robbery and the killing is to be found in my remarks: R v HT [2012] NSWSC 656.
4After the incident Abraham Rodriguez and HT went to a shop in Lidcombe where a friend of theirs, John Le, was working in a family business.  There Abraham Rodriguez gave Mr Le the bloodstained knife and asked him to hide it.  Mr Le did so.  He also washed the blood off the knife and wiped it to remove his fingerprints from it.
5On the evening of the following day Mr Le received a telephone call from the offender.  It was apparent from the terms of the call that the offender was aware that Mr Le had the knife which his son had used in the incident.  He said that it was ""very important"" that arrangements be made for him to pick the knife up.  In the event, it was agreed that Mr Le would deliver the knife to the offender at his home in Regents Park the following day.  On that day Mr Le delivered the knife to the offender, as arranged.  The offender thanked him, saying ""you're saving my son's life,"" and ""you're doing yourself a huge favour.""  
6The effect of the jury's verdict is that they were satisfied that the offender then disposed of the knife, knowing that it had been used in the killing, and intending to prevent his son from being brought to justice for that offence.  It had also been the Crown case that the offender assisted his son to leave the country, but I ruled that that inference was not available on the evidence and directed the jury accordingly.  The verdict of guilty as accessory after the fact to manslaughter means that the jury were not satisfied that Abraham Rodriguez killed the victim in circumstances amounting to murder, an issue which had been left to them for consideration.  The offence of accessory after the fact to manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 5 years.
Subjective case
7The offender was 44 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 60.  He has no criminal record.  
8He is a married man with 5 children, Abraham being his eldest.  He was born and brought up in El Salvador.  There he gained an economics degree.  He was a member of a political party known as the Social Democratic Party, which was in government until 1980, when it was ousted after a military coup.  There was then an extreme right wing government in place and members of the Social Democratic Party were not safe.  The offender hid in El Salvador and then fled to Mexico.  There his wife and children joined him, and they lived in that country for 4 years before migrating to Australia.  
9In this country he has been a responsible and industrious citizen.  I have abundant evidence of his good character in a number of testimonials and in the oral evidence of his son-in-law, Nathan Izci.  There is no need to set this material out in any detail.  It establishes that the offender has been a consistent worker and is a devoted father, and it attests to his integrity, generosity and loyalty.  He is a respected member of the Jehovah's Witnesses church.
10He does not enjoy good health, suffering from diabetes and a heart condition.  He was arrested on 24 August 2009, and spent 7 days in custody before being released on bail.  His bail conditions were demanding, effectively confining him to his home except in very limited circumstances.  In December 2010 and May 2011, the bail conditions were relaxed to the extent of allowing him to leave home to practice his religion and maintain employment.  He is entitled to have these matters taken into account on sentence, although they are of little weight.
Sentencing
11In assessing the gravity of the offence, Mr Hamill SC, who appeared with Mr Longville for the offender, noted that, unlike some cases of accessory after the fact, the offender had no involvement whatsoever in the principal offence and no direct knowledge of the details of it.  Of itself, the knife which he disposed of would have had little evidentiary value as it had been washed and any fingerprints had been wiped off it.  It could not have been linked to the principal offence without the evidence of Mr Le and the juvenile, who did not come forward with truthful information until many years after the event.  Obviously, in this case the relationship between the accessory and the principal offender is a significant factor.  This was a case of a father taking action, no doubt in great distress and with a sense of urgency, to shield his son from the consequences of a serious crime.
12On the other hand, I am mindful of the considerations raised by the Crown prosecutor.  She acknowledged the significance of the relationship of father and son but pointed out that, unlike many cases, this was not one in which the accessory was under the influence of, or emotionally dependent upon, the principal offender.  She also pointed out that, in persuading Mr Le to hand the knife over to him, the offender had used the authority of a mature adult over a young man who was still in the last year of secondary school.
13Accessory after the fact to manslaughter is an offence not commonly encountered, and the present is an unusual offence of that kind.  There are Judicial Commission statistics of sentences for this offence, but the number of cases is small and the figures are of little or no assistance.  Both Mr Hamill and the Crown prosecutor referred me to the decisions in some of those cases, but the facts of all of them are very different from the present case and they can provide no useful guide to the sentence which I should pass.  
14The present offence is a serious one, although obviously by no means the most serious of its kind.  Notwithstanding the close relationship which was the driving force behind it, it was a spectacular fall from grace by a man otherwise highly regarded for his integrity and social responsibility, and a man whose religious faith, according to Mr Izci, bound him to impart those same values to his children.  
15While the offender's desire to protect his son from retribution is understandable, the fact remains that he committed a serious offence, calculated to frustrate the administration of criminal justice.  He has the benefit of the evidence of his good character, and I think it most unlikely that he would re-offend.  Nevertheless, general deterrence is a significant factor in sentencing for crimes such as this.  The offender's criminality should be marked by the imposition of a custodial sentence.  An appropriate sentence, in my view, is imprisonment for 2 years.  However, given all the circumstances, including the offender's age and his general good character, I am satisfied that that sentence should be suspended.  
16Rafael Rodriguez, for the offence of accessory after the fact to manslaughter you are sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years.  I order that the execution of that sentence be suspended for 2 years and direct that you be released on condition that you enter into a bond to be of good behaviour, also for a term of 2 years.
17Before parting with the matter, it is appropriate that I again express my sympathy to the family of the young victim.  In the best of circumstances it must be very difficult for them to come to terms with their loss, but I appreciate that that process is rendered even more difficult by the fact that the person alleged to have played the most culpable role in this tragic event has not yet been brought to justice.

2759453,R v Simon Peter BRADDON [2012] NSWSC 662,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1The offender, Simon Peter Braddon, was indicted in this court for the murder of Gregory Partridge at Mandurama on 27 September 2010.  His plea of guilty to an alternative count of manslaughter was accepted by the Crown in discharge of that indictment.  The basis of manslaughter is that he killed Mr Partridge by an unlawful and dangerous act, without intending to kill him or to cause him serious injury.
Facts
2Mr Partridge lived in Gold Street, Mandurama.  The offender lived in the same street, not far away.  In the afternoon of Sunday, 26 September 2010, Mr Partridge visited the offender at his home.  They drank together and Mr Partridge left, saying that he was going to catch a bus to Bathurst to buy some heroin.  The offender tried to dissuade him from doing so.  
3Mr Partridge spent the following day, Monday, 27 September 2010, in Bathurst.  There, among other things, he obtained some methadone from a chemist for use over the following days.  He got back to Mandurama in the early evening and, shortly afterwards, the offender visited him at his home.
4There the offender struck Mr Partridge a number of times to his back and other parts of his body, using a piece of pine.  Mr Partridge died as a result of that assault.  Before he died he rang a friend to say that he had been assaulted ""by someone with bipolar disorder who lives down the road.""  He described being struck by a piece of wood, and said that he was covered in blood but would be ""ok.""  He finished the conversation by saying, ""The amount of crap I have copped off that bloke over the years.""  That was the last time anyone spoke with him.
5At about midday on Tuesday, 28 December 2010, neighbours went to Mr Partridge's home.  There they found him dead on his bed.  Police and ambulance attended the scene, and large welts were observed on his back.
6Two days later a post-mortem was conducted by Dr Allan Cala, forensic pathologist.  Dr Cala found that the direct cause of death was blood loss due to a lacerated spleen.  He noted a number of injuries to Mr Partridge apart from the lacerated spleen, there being a fracture to one of his ribs and a number of other lacerations and areas of bruising.  Mr Partridge was of slight build, being 163 centimetres tall and weighing only 49 kilograms.  Dr Cala concluded that the rupture of the spleen was due to blunt force trauma to the back, noting two linear welts in that area.
7On the same day as the post-mortem examination, 30 September 2010, police spoke to the offender at his residence in the course of a canvas of the area.  He was highly agitated, was crying, and was saying, ""Just take me away.""  The offender later said that this was a reference to some cannabis he may have had at the house.  Police noted him to be upset and aggressive, and considered his demeanour to be highly suspicious.  
8Further investigation led to police conducting an electronically recorded interview with the offender on 4 October 2010.  He told police about Mr Partridge's visit on the day before the killing, and of his attempt to talk him out of going to Bathurst to buy heroin.  However, he denied having visited Mr Partridge on the day he died.
9Police later spoke to the offender's mother, Trish Braddon, and his sister, Candice Braddon.  Trish Braddon told them that, in the days leading up to the offence, the offender's mental state had deteriorated so much that she was concerned he might become violent.  On 30 September 2010, the offender telephoned her and told her that detectives had been to his house asking questions about the death of Mr Partridge.  She feared that he might have been involved in killing him.
10On Wednesday, 6 October 2010, the offender voluntarily admitted himself to the Bloomfield Mental Health Facility.  Why he did so is unclear.  However, Trish Braddon later told police that, earlier that day, he had threatened to commit suicide. 
11On 8 December 2010, a listening device was installed at the offender's house.  On 18 December 2010, police contacted Trish Braddon and asked that she speak with them at Blayney Police Station.  The offender became aware of this arrangement and was recorded as saying to his sister, ""It's up to her.  Fuck it, if she wants to roll.""  A short time later Trish Braddon was heard to say, ""I have to live with myself ... .  I think they've got it worked out ... .""  She was crying as she said this.  That evening, there was a conversation between the offender and Trish Braddon relating to the killing of Mr Partridge.  The offender was heard to say, ""I am probably guilty.  I liked him, Mum.  I just can't put the pieces together.""
12On the following day, 19 December 2010, the following conversation between Trish Braddon and the offender was recorded:
Trish Braddon said, ""Listen to him.  Because I've been telling you.  You don't know your own strength, Simon.""
The offender said, ""I didn't hit him that hard, Mum.  Fuckin' hell, please don't tell 'em about it.""
Trish Braddon said, ""I didn't, but I think it helps for me for that fella to say, I don't think for a minute that I'm going to break ... .  He said, Trish, I don't have any doubt about it and ... can you [do] me the courtesy of telling me first ... and I think it's best that we're the ones to know.""
13On Tuesday, 21 December 2010, the offender was heard to say to his mother, ""I've lost a good friend here.  Even if I was in a bad place, I didn't intend for him to die.""
14The offender was arrested on Thursday, 23 December 2010.  He was interviewed in the presence of his mother and declined to comment on the offence.  He was then charged.
15The offence must be understood in the light of the offender's mental illness at the time.  A history of mental illness, together with treatment from time to time, is to be found in a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, which is in evidence.  Dr Allnutt diagnosed him as suffering from bipolar affective disorder, which was also the diagnosis when the offender was admitted to Bloomfield Mental Health Facility on 6 October 2010.
16The offender gave Dr Allnutt an account of the offence, which was not challenged by the Crown prosecutor in the sentence proceedings.  He said that, when he went to Mr Partridge's home on the evening of the offence, he found him mixing heroin.  He picked up a spoon which Mr Partridge had been using, intending to put it down the sink.  Mr Partridge picked up a syringe and threatened him, saying that he should put the spoon down, which he did.  He was scared, thinking that Mr Partridge might stab him with the syringe.  He noticed a piece of wood which Mr Partridge used to keep the bathroom door open.  Mr Partridge came towards him, he picked the piece of wood up and struck him several times with it.  He then left the house, not thinking that he had caused Mr Partridge any serious harm.  He recalled feeling upset because of what he had done, and wished that he had not picked up the spoon.  
17It seems that the offender bore Mr Partridge no ill will, and had considered him a friend.  He told Dr Allnutt of an incident in January 2010 when he had become angry with Mr Partridge over something said which he considered offensive, and had seized him by the throat and remonstrated with him.  This event appears to have been trivial, and is of no present significance.  It was common ground that the incident leading to the killing was triggered by the offender's concern about Mr Partridge's use of heroin and his attempt to stop him doing so on that occasion.  
18However, Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion, which I accept, that he was in the manic phase of his bipolar illness at the time and that this contributed to his behaviour.  This was consistent with his description of his condition in the period leading up to the offence.  Dr Allnutt explained that ""hypomania is a mental state that contributes to disinhibited behaviour, poor social judgment, and increased irritability.""
19Between March and August 2010, the offender had been on a course of the medication Interferon for hepatitis C.  It seems that this drug can have mood altering effects, and Dr Allnutt considered that it may also have been a contributing factor to the offender's behaviour.  The doctor expressed his conclusion in this way:
""At the material time ... he was experiencing a manic mental state with associated grandiose and probable persecutory delusions derived from an underlying bipolar affective disorder triggered by medication (Interferon treatment).""
Nevertheless, there is force in the Crown prosecutor's argument that it is not clear whether Interferon was a contributing factor.  The fact remains, however, that the offender's mental illness certainly was.  
Subjective case
20The offender was 36 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 38.  He has a criminal history, including some entries for violence, but it is old.  The offences were dealt with in the Local Court and all of them were disposed of by non-custodial orders.  His record is of little significance for present purposes.
21He was brought up in the Bathurst area.  His earlier years were not without their difficulties, as there was some domestic violence in the home, but his parents remain supportive of him, as does his sister.  The three of them were present at the sentence hearing.  He was educated to year 9 level and, apparently, was a slow learner.  He had sporadic employment of a rural kind, but had been unemployed for some time when the offence occurred.  In his twenties he had a relationship with a woman which produced three children.  That relationship has not endured and, as I understand it, he does not maintain contact with the children or their mother.
22No doubt his personal life has been affected by his mental illness which, in one form or another, appears to have been longstanding.  As I have said, he has had treatment from time to time, since his diagnosis in earlier years with ADHD.  He also has a history of the abuse of alcohol and a variety of illicit drugs, principally cannabis.  He has been receiving treatment while in custody since his arrest.
23Dr Allnutt considered the risk of his re-offending, and saw his mental illness and other aspects of his background as suggesting ""a moderate vulnerability to impulsive aggression in the longer term, in particular if he does not maintain psychological stability and begins to abuse substances again.""  In his report Dr Allnutt continued:
""Currently he manifests insight in his illness; he does not manifest active symptoms of mental illness; there is no evidence of ongoing impulsivity; he seems to be responding to treatment and does not manifest attitudes that condone violent offending which would suggest to me that given his current mental state he is unlikely to act in an aggressive manner.
It is probable that his mental illness is a significant factor in mediating his propensity to aggression and that if this remains under control the risk of re-offending in an aggressive manner is reduced; this depends on his ongoing engagement with treatment, the availability of adequate mental health services and support, and abstinence from substances.""
24He expressed remorse to Dr Allnutt, and it appeared to the doctor that he accepted responsibility for his actions and the loss they had caused.  That expression of remorse is consistent with some of his statements recorded by the listening device, to which I have referred earlier, and I accept it as genuine.  It is also consistent with his plea of guilty, which was entered on his arraignment but had been offered before his committal for trial.  I shall recognise the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty by a reduction of the sentence otherwise appropriate.
Victim impact statements
25I received victim impact statements by Mr Partridge's two brothers, Michael and Stephen.  Michael Partridge read them to the court.  They are a moving account of the grief and outrage this violent death has caused them and their mother, and of the enduring effects this tragedy has had upon the lives of all of them.  I expressed my deepest sympathy to them at that time, and I do so again now.  
Sentencing
26Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being and, of course, is always a serious crime.  Nevertheless, it is a crime which can be committed in a wide variety of circumstances, and careful attention must be given to the facts of the case at hand when arriving at the appropriate sentence.  In the present case the offender delivered multiple blows with a piece of wood to a man significantly smaller than himself.  It is a distressing feature of the case that Mr Partridge died alone and without assistance.  It seems that he initially did not realise how badly he was injured.  It may be, as the Crown prosecutor suggested, that his use of methadone had dulled his pain and masked the severity of his injuries.  That a weapon was used by the offender and that the crime was committed in the victim's home are matters properly required to be taken into account in assessing the gravity of the offence.  
27On the other hand, the attack was undoubtedly spontaneous and the use of the piece of wood was opportunistic.  Obviously, the circumstances leading to the offence which I have described, and the contributing effect of the offender's mental illness, are significant mitigating factors.  True it is that the offender left the house without attempting to assist Mr Partridge, but I accept that he also was not aware of the seriousness of the injuries he had caused.  It may well be, as his mother suggested in one of the recorded conversations, that he did not know his own strength.  
28As I have said, the offender's criminal history is of little significance and, in any event, he had a clear record for about 8 years before this offence.  I take into account in his favour his remorse and his prospects of rehabilitation.  He enjoys the continuing support of his family but, of course, the most significant issue is his mental illness.  I agree with Dr Allnutt that his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable, as the doctor put it, ""as long as he pursues and maintains psychiatric treatment and oversight as well as abstinence from substances.""  Clearly, he would benefit from an extended period of conditional liberty subject to supervision and the sanction of parole and, to that end, I find special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period.
29His plea of guilty was accepted by the Crown prosecutor as having been offered at the first reasonable opportunity.  I shall reduce the sentence otherwise appropriate by 20% to recognise the utilitarian value of that plea.  To assist me in arriving at the appropriate sentence, counsel provided me with a number of manslaughter sentence cases having features broadly similar to the present case.  Of course, I approach those cases mindful that they can serve as no more than a rough guide because each of those cases turned on its own facts.  A few of the cases had features which marked them as clearly more or less serious than the present case.  Putting them aside, and taking a broad view of the remaining cases in which there was a plea of guilty, what emerges is a pattern of head sentences between 5 and 7 years and non-parole periods between 3 and 4 ½ years.
30But for his plea of guilty, I would have sentenced the offender to imprisonment for 7 years.  A reduction of 20% produces a figure, rounded off, of 5 ½ years.  While I have found special circumstances, the need to set a non-parole period sufficient to mark his criminality means that there can be only a modest departure from the statutory proportion.  I shall set a non-parole period of 3 years.  The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 23 December 2010, and the sentence will date from that day.
31Simon Peter Braddon, for the manslaughter of Gregory Partridge you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 23 December 2010 and expiring on 22 December 2013, and a balance of term of 2 ½ years, commencing on 23 December 2013 and expiring on 22 June 2016.  You will be eligible for release on parole on 22 December 2013.

		15 June 2012",2012-06-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759457,Neville Mahon v Mach 1 Financial Services Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 651,"Judgment
1These are proceedings for injurious falsehood arising out of the publication of a large number of emails concerning the plaintiff posted on two wikifrauds websites.  The plaintiff is a property developer based in New Zealand.  The first defendant is alleged to be the registrant of the two domain names in question, ""wikifrauds.net/NevilleMahon.html"" and ""wikifrauds.diariobit.es/NevilleMahon.html"" (""the websites"").  The second defendant is a director of the first defendant and the sole editor of the websites.  The third defendant is alleged to be the present proprietor of the websites.
2The remaining defendants are alleged to be the authors or original publishers of the emails.  The plaintiff alleges that the first, second and third defendants republished the emails on the websites. 
3The proceedings were commenced by summons filed on 25 November 2011 and amended on 2 December 2011.  The relief sought in the amended summons was calculated to shut down the websites on an interlocutory basis and contemplated that the claim would then proceed on pleadings.
4On 7 December 2011, Garling J granted the interlocutory relief sought.  His Honour made orders against the first, second and third defendants restraining those parties from maintaining the websites or publishing like material concerning the plaintiff; requiring them to do all things necessary to shut down the websites and requiring them to do all things necessary to cause the removal of the links to the websites from specific internet search engines.  The injunctions were granted until further order.
5On 26 March 2012 the plaintiff filed his statement of claim.  The application before the Court is the defendants' application to have part of that pleading struck out.
6The relief sought in the notice of motion filed on 18 April 2012 is as follows.
1.  The amended statement of claim (sic) and in particular those paragraphs pertaining to a claim of injurious falsehood be struck out by reason of it being (a) vexatious, (b) embarrassing, (c) disclosing no cause of action.
2.  The plaintiff pay the plaintiff's costs (sic) of:
   (a)  its application fixed in the sum of $7,500;
(b)  the injunction made 7 December 2011 fixed in the sum of $27,500.
7Although the motion refers to an amended statement of claim, the only pleading in the proceedings is the statement of claim to which I have already referred.
8The basis on which the pleading is challenged is the contention that it does not adequately plead the element of damage.  
9It was common ground at the hearing that actual damage is an element of the tort.  Mr Catlin, who appears for the defendants, cited the well known passage from the judgment of Bowen LJ in Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 at 527 to 528, where his Lordship said:
That an action will lie for written or oral falsehoods, not actionable per se nor even defamatory, where they are maliciously published, where they are calculated in the ordinary course of things to produce, and where they do produce, actual damage, is established law.  Such an action is not one of libel or of slander, but an action on the case for damage wilfully and intentionally done without just occasion or excuse, analogous to an action for slander of title.
10As noted by Mr Catlin, that passage has been taken to be an accurate statement of the law respecting injurious falsehood in Australia: Palmer Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons [2001] HCA 69; (2001) 208 CLR 388 at [57] per Gummow J.
11The plaintiff acknowledges that no actual damage has been pleaded.  The only pleading of damage in the statement of claim appears at paragraph 32, which states that the matters complained of ""were calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in respect of his business as a property developer"".
12By way of explanation Mr Narayan, who appears for the plaintiff, explained that the only relief that will be sought by the plaintiff is a permanent injunction to restrain the alleged injurious falsehoods.  Mr Narayan acknowledged that the statement of claim also pleads a cause of action in defamation and, further, that the relief claimed includes damages.  However, he stated that, upon further reflection and in light of the interlocutory relief granted by Garling J, the plaintiff has decided to abandon the claim in defamation and to abandon any claim for damages.
13The defendants' motion invokes the Court's power under r 14.28 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005.  Mr Catlin acknowledged that, in order to have the pleading of the cause of action in injurious falsehood struck out under that rule, the defendants had to demonstrate that the claim is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed, in accordance with the test stated in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130 per Barwick CJ.
14The application seemed to raise two discrete complaints as to the element of actual damage in the plaintiff's claim.  Before turning to those points I should observe, in fairness to the defendants' legal representatives, that the plaintiff does not appear to have communicated his intention to abandon the claim for damages and the claim in defamation until 28 May 2012, when he swore an affidavit to that effect.  At the time the notice of motion was filed on 18 April 2012, so far as the material before me reveals, the defendants thought that those claims would be maintained.  That thinking continued to pervade the defendants' submissions in support of the application even after the plaintiff's revised position was made clear.
No pleading of actual damage
15The defendants' first complaint relates to the absence of any pleading of actual damage.  In my view, that is not a basis for concluding that the claim cannot succeed in the present case, notwithstanding the fact that damage is an element of the cause of action.  
16The question whether the Court has power to grant an injunction in the absence of evidence of actual loss was considered by Hunt J in Swimsure (Laboratories) Pty Ltd v McDonald [1979] 2 NSWLR 796 at 802D.  Acknowledging earlier English authority to the contrary, his Honour noted that s 66 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 permits the grant of an interlocutory injunction to restrain any threatened or apprehended injury ""as well in a case where the injury is not actionable unless it causes damage as in other cases"".  His Honour expressed the view, at pain of earning the description of being ""a liberal (i.e. woolly-minded) judge"" that:
It would be a strange result that such relief, designed as it is to prevent injury, could not be granted until after the injury had occurred ...
17His Honour proceeded on the basis that it was sufficient that the plaintiff had established:
On the evidence, that there is a reasonable probability that actual damage will result to the plaintiff from the continued publication of the statements in question. 
18Hunt J noted that the authorities prior to the amendment of s 66 were to the contrary, but compared the remarks of McCardie J in British Railway Traffic & Electric Co Ltd v CRC Co Ltd and the London County Council [1922] 2 KB 260 at 272, 273.  In that case, McCardie J refused an injunction partly on the basis that no damage would necessarily arise from the publication in question.  However, in so finding, his Honour expressed the view that an injunction might properly be granted without proof of special damage before the commencement of proceedings, where such damage would either necessarily or probably result: at 272.6.  His Honour said:
The main object of an injunction is to prevent a man from doing that which will presumably give a cause of action to a plaintiff.  It deals with a future rather than an existing cause of action.
19The defendant sought to find support for the contrary position in the proposition that ""only a present right will be protected, not an inchoate future right"", citing Glamagard Pty Ltd v Enderslea Productions Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 138.  I do not think that decision has any relevance to the present question.  The plaintiffs were the registered owners of designs registered under the Designs Act 1906 (Cth) but also the applicants for registration of other designs and for the grant of certain patents.  To the extent that the application sought to restrain infringement of the rights as to which the plaintiffs were only applicants (and not yet registered owners), McLelland J held (at 140C):
The power of the Court to grant final quia timet relief has never been extended to cases where the threat of infringement is not of a present, but only of an inchoate future right or interest, and the same limitation must necessarily apply to interlocutory relief.
20The present case is not concerned with an inchoate future right or interest, but with the plaintiff's existing interest in the conduct of his business.  (In Palmer Bruyn, Gummow J planted the seed for an argument that the tort may in any event be broad enough to include any damaging falsehood which interferes with prospective advantage: at [60]).
21It may be acknowledged that, in Swimsure, Hunt J was concerned with an application for an interlocutory injunction.  The present application is concerned with the pleading of a claim for a final injunction.  Curiously, s 66 of the Supreme Court Act makes no express reference to final injunctions.  Section 66(1) confers power to restrain injury ""by interlocutory or other injunction"".  However, that expression appears to be intended to cover the universe of injunctions, including the final relief sought by the plaintiff in the present case.  
22The proposition that a final injunction may be granted in the absence of proof of actual loss and on the strength of the probability that loss would occur if the injunction were not granted was applied by me in Australand Holdings Ltd v Transparency & Accountability Council Inc [2008] NSWSC 669 at [169], cited with approval by Brereton J in AMI Australia Holdings Ltd v Fairfax Media Publication Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 1395 at [38].
23It follows, in my view, that the statement of claim is not liable to be struck out for want of pleading of actual damage.
Nature of the interest sought to be protected
24The defendants' submissions appeared to raise a second, more subtle complaint concerning the absence of specificity in the plaintiff's evidence as to any actual commercial activity of his that has been targeted and threatened by the publications complained of.  Mr Catlin noted, by way of contrast, the particularity of the business interests considered in other injurious falsehood cases including the decision in Swimsure and also in Beechwood Homes (NSW) Pty Ltd v Camenzuli [2010] NSWSC 521 at [15] per Harrison J and Kaplan v Go Daddy Group [2005] NSWSC 636 per White J.
25The publications in the present case are concerned with the development of the Hilton Denarau Resort on Denarau Island in Fiji.  In his affidavit sworn in support of the interlocutory injunction granted by Garling J, Mr Mahon stated that the developer of the resort was Denarau Investments Ltd and that the developer appointed Denarau International Ltd to manage the resort.  The affidavit goes on to describe a dispute which subsequently arose between the manager and owners of villas at the resort. 
26It is not possible to glean from that material the precise proprietary or commercial interest of the plaintiff sought to be protected in the proceedings.  The defendants should not have to speculate on that issue or accept affidavits as a substitute for proper particularisation of the case.  Paragraph 32 of the statement of claim is, in my view, wholly inadequate for the purpose of putting the defendants on notice as to the case they have to meet on the question whether there is a reasonable probability that actual damage will result to the plaintiff from the continued publication of the statements in question.  
27However, since the defendants have never sought particulars as to the basis for that contention, I do not think it is appropriate to strike out the pleading at this stage.  I propose as a first step to direct the plaintiff to provide proper particulars.
28In that context, it should be noted that, as explained by Brereton J in AMI Australia Holdings Pty Ltd at [37], the law does not require proof of ""special damage"" in the sense of the loss of any individual client or contract but only ""actual damage"", which may include a general loss of business.  In the present context, it would appear on those principles to be enough if the plaintiff can establish that a general loss of business would probably result from the continued publication of the statements in question.  
29The problem remains, however, that the plaintiff has not articulated any particulars of his personal business interests, as opposed to those of the companies named in his affidavit.  I do not think the broad assertion that he is a property developer is sufficient to put the defendants on notice of the case they will have to meet in that respect.  Detailed particulars of the facts, matters and circumstances relied upon to establish the probability of actual loss will have to be provided.
Defamation by another name 
30A separate complaint raised in the defendants' submissions is the contention that this is a defamation claim masked as injurious falsehood.  It is necessary to explain why that is perceived as a vice.  
31To restrain an alleged defamation necessarily restrains free speech to an extent.  For that reason, it is well recognised that the power to restrain the publication of allegedly defamatory matter must be exercised ""with great caution, and only in very clear cases"": Swimsure at 799E.   In that decision, Hunt J explained that the public interest in unfettered free speech has produced the principle that, in defamation actions, there is a special exception from the ordinary ""balance of convenience"" rule in applications for interlocutory injunctions.  The exception operates so as to afford substantial weight to the value of free speech when weighing the respective inconvenience or prejudice to the parties.  
32Hunt J noted in that context that a plaintiff cannot avoid the special exception merely by framing his case, not in defamation, but in injurious falsehood or some other cause of action.  His Honour cited two decisions of the English Court of Appeal in support of that principle: Fraser v Evans [1969] 1 QB 349 at 362 and Woodward v Hutchins [1977] 2 All ER 751 at 755.  
33Fraser v Evans was a case involving claims in both defamation and breach of confidence.  The plaintiff, Mr Fraser, sought an interlocutory injunction against the editor of the Sunday Times to restrain the publication of an article concerning a confidential report he had prepared for the Greek government.  The Court of Appeal held that Mr Fraser could not get an injunction in defamation, having regard to ""the importance in the public interest that the truth should out"": at 360G per Lord Denning MR; Widgery LJ evidently agreeing at 364B; Davies LJ not deciding.
34The injunction was sought in the alternative on the grounds of breach of confidence.  The Court rejected that argument on the basis that the only duty of confidence was owed to the Greek government, which did not seek to restrain the publication.  
35Separately, the publisher had submitted that, as no injunction should be granted to restrain the apprehended defamation, likewise no injunction should be granted on the grounds of breach of confidence (at 362D): 
The plaintiff should not be able to avoid the salutary rule of law in libel by framing the case in breach of confidence. 
36Since the appeal was disposed of on a different basis, the Court did not consider it necessary to deal with that point.  Lord Denning said (at 362E):
I can well see that there may be cases where it would be wrong to grant an injunction on breach of confidence when it would not be granted on libel:  but I can equally well see that there are some cases of breach of confidence which are defamatory, where the court might intervene, even though the defendant says he intends to justify.
37Woodward v Hutchins was a case in which a group of ""pop stars"" evidently believed that their public image was a wholesome one.  Their former manager approached the Daily Mirror and revealed surprising details of their having actually behaved pretty badly from time to time.  The pop stars sued in libel, breach of contract and breach of confidence.  An interlocutory injunction was granted at first instance but discharged by the Court of Appeal.  Relevantly for present purposes, Lord Denning said:
the plaintiffs' real complaint here is that the words are defamatory; and as they cannot get an interlocutory injunction on that ground, nor should they on confidential information.
38There may be force in the contention that the plaintiff's real complaint is that the words are defamatory in the present case.  The plaintiff relies upon the same meanings for the cause of action in injurious falsehood as for the cause in defamation, which is no longer pressed.  Most of those meanings relate to the plaintiff's character personally and may well be matters that sound in damage to reputation rather than damage to any business or proprietary interest.  Whether that is so will no doubt become clearer upon the provision of the particulars I propose to direct.  
39However, subject to the need for the plaintiff to articulate an arguable basis for establishing that element of the claim, the consideration identified by Lord Denning in the two cases to which I have referred is ultimately a factor to be considered in the exercise of the discretionary power to grant injunctive relief.  It is not relevant on the present application, which is concerned with the form of the pleadings.  It is a point which might have been taken at the time when the interlocutory injunction was contested before Garling J and it will no doubt be raised at the point when the claim for final relief is determined.  In my view, however, it is not a strike-out point.
Conclusion
40During the hearing of the defendants' motion, I indicated my tentative view that the plaintiff should be directed to provide particulars of the commercial and proprietary interests of the plaintiff which he contends would probably be harmed by the falsehoods alleged.  Mr Narayan responded by asking whether the relevant proprietary and commercial interests necessarily have to be in Australia.  I granted leave to the parties to put on further written submissions on that issue.
41Each of the parties has provided careful written submissions directed to that question.  After considering those submissions, I have concluded that it is premature to determine any question relating to the issue raised by Mr Narayan.  The statement of claim alleges publication in the State of New South Wales.  Since the relevant publications are Internet publications, that is to be taken as an allegation that the material complained of was downloaded on to the computers of people in New South Wales:  Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick [2002] HCA 56; (2002) 210 CLR 575 at [44] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.  Until the plaintiff has provided particulars as to the actual damage to his business interests that would probably have resulted from continuation of the publications restrained by Garling J, it is not possible to know what force there is in either parties' submissions on that question.
42Accordingly, the only order I make at this stage is to direct the plaintiff to provide particulars of the facts, matters and circumstances on the basis of which he contends that actual damage to his business or proprietary interests would probably result from the continued publication in New South Wales of the alleged false representations complained of.
43The defendants' notice of motion should be stood over to a date convenient to the parties after the provision of those particulars.

		28 June 2012",2012-06-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759458,New South Wales Crime Commission v Hung Sun Choi [2012] NSWSC 658,"Judgment
1HER HONOUR:  These are proceedings brought by the New South Wales Crime Commission under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990.  The final relief sought by the Commission is a confiscation order relating to the ""unexplained wealth"" of the defendant: s 28A of the Act.  This judgment determines the Commission's application by notice of motion for ancillary orders in aid of that claim, including an examination order and an order directing the defendant to provide a verified statement of property under s 31D of the Act.  
Background - criminal proceedings against the defendant
2The proceedings arise out of the defendant's arrest on 22 November 2011.  Police allege that, on that date, the defendant went to a cafeteria in Burwood carrying an airline travel bag, which he placed on the floor.  The defendant asked an employee at the cafeteria if he could use a pay phone.  He was told that the closest pay phone was at a nearby shopping mall.  
3It is alleged that the defendant then put his hand into a bag being held by a woman standing next to him at the counter of the cafeteria (perhaps trying to find a phone).  The woman's reaction to that event caused him to flee from the cafeteria, leaving the airline travel bag behind.  The bag was found to contain $686,120 in cash together with travel documents in the name of the defendant.  He was arrested later that day after being found sitting in the gutter in the rain.  Upon being approached by police, he freely identified himself.  Police allege that he gave his occupation as ""drug dealer"".  He denies making that statement.  
4In relation to his possession of the cash in the travel bag, the defendant was charged with an offence of money laundering contrary to s 193B of the Crimes Act 1900; an offence of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193C of the Act (presumably an alternative to the money laundering charge) and an offence of being in possession of property reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained contrary to s 527C of the Act (presumably a further alternative charge).
Concurrent civil proceedings under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act
5On 27 January 2012 the Commission commenced these proceedings under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.  That Act creates a series of statutory civil remedies by which the Commission can pursue the confiscation of what might loosely be termed ill-gotten gains.  The objects of the Act expressly contemplate the pursuit of those remedies without requiring any criminal conviction: s 3(a) of the Act.   
6There are three kinds of confiscation order provided for under the Act.  Each requires an application to the Supreme Court.  One kind of confiscation order is an ""unexplained wealth order"" under s 28A of the Act requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the court as the value of the unexplained wealth of the person.  That is the relief sought in the present proceedings.
7The legislature clearly intended by the Act to provide effective and efficient statutory mechanisms for the confiscation of proceeds of crime and, to that end, saw fit to confine the powers of this Court, and the rights of defendants, closely.  That is plain not only from the objects of the Act set out in s 3 but also from many provisions of the Act itself.
8As to unexplained wealth orders, s 28A(2) provides that the Court ""must"" make such an order if the Court finds that there is a reasonable suspicion that the person against whom the order is sought has engaged in a serious crime related activity (as defined in the Act) or has acquired serious crime derived property from any serious crime related activity of another person.  Curiously, the circumstance that enlivens the requirement to make such an order (a finding of reasonable suspicion) differs from the two other kinds of confiscation order.  Those provisions also speak to the Court in mandatory terms, but require proof on the balance of probabilities of serious crime related activity: see s 22(2) dealing with assets forfeiture orders and s 27(2) dealing with proceeds assessment orders.  What is plain in any case is that the Act mandates the making of confiscation orders on the strength of evidence well short of proof beyond reasonable doubt.    
9Upon the making of an unexplained wealth order, the onus of proof falls upon the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that the current or previous wealth (as identified in evidence provided by the Commission) of the person is not or was not illegally acquired property or the proceeds of an illegal activity:  s 28B(3) and (5).  Any part of the wealth of the person as to which that onus is not discharged is assessed to be ""unexplained wealth"" and is required to be paid to the Treasurer in accordance with the unexplained wealth order.  
10Section 31D of the Act confers additional powers on the Court ancillary to an application for a confiscation order.  Sections 31D(1)(a) and (c) provide:
(a) an order for the examination on oath of:
(i) the affected person, or(ii) another person,
before the Court, or before an officer of the Court prescribed by rules of court, concerning the affairs of the affected person, including the nature and location of any property in which the affected person has an interest,....

(c) an order directing a person who is or was an affected person or, if the affected person is or was a body corporate, a director of the body corporate specified by the Court, to furnish to the Commission, within a period specified in the order, a statement, verified by the oath of the person making the statement, setting out such particulars of the property, or dealings with the property, in which the affected person has or had an interest as the Court thinks proper.
Relief sought by the Commission
11The present application invokes those provisions.  The first three orders sought in the notice of motion are: 
1.An order pursuant to section 31D(1)(a) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 that the Defendant, Hung Sun Choi, be examined on oath before a Judge or Registrar of the Court concerning his affairs, including the nature and location of any property in which he has an interest, including any interest in the property described in Schedule One below.
2.An order that leave be granted to the Plaintiff to obtain from the Registry dates for the conduct of the above examination.3.An order pursuant to section 31D(1)(c) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 that the Defendant, Hung Sun Choi, furnish to the Plaintiff, within 21 days of the making of this order, a statement verified by oath or affirmation, setting out the particulars in Schedule Two below.
12The ""property described in schedule one"" (referred to in order one) is the cash located in the bag allegedly left by the defendant at the cafeteria in Burwood.  The particulars sought in schedule two (referred to in order two) expressly include ""full particulars of the source of the monies described in schedule one"".  Accordingly, there is no ambiguity in the fact that the orders sought would compel the defendant to answer questions on oath, and to provide a verified statement, concerning matters in issue in the prosecution of the criminal charges against him.
13The Commission also seeks further relief (prefaced by some unusual commentary) as set out below:
AND ONLY IF IT IS NECESSARY in order that the examination order sought in paragraph 1 above be made, or that the verified statement order sought in paragraph 3 above be made, that either or both of the following orders be made:
4.An order pursuant to section 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010, that any evidence given by the Defendant at his examination pursuant to section 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 is not to be published, as defined in section 3 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010, or disclosed by any person other than:
(a)for the purposes of these proceedings; or
(b)for the purposes of investigating or prosecuting an offence in respect of any false or misleading evidence given by the Defendant at his examination,
until further order of the Court, upon the ground that this order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice in relation to criminal proceedings against the Defendant that are pending.
5.An order pursuant to section 71 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005, that the examination of the Defendant pursuant to section 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 shall be conducted in the absence of the public and only the following persons shall be permitted to attend any such examination:
(a)the legal representative/s and Forensic Accountant for the Plaintiff;
(b)the legal representative/s for the Defendant;
(c)Court staff; and
(d)Corrective Services officers responsible for the custody of the Defendant, if he is remanded in custody at the time of his examination,
upon the ground that the presence of the public would defeat the ends of justice.
14As will be apparent from the reasons that follow, I do not consider it necessary to make such orders and in my view it would be premature to do so at this stage.  I would not wish that conclusion to be taken as suggesting that such orders would not be appropriate at some point in the future. 
Hearing of the Commission's motion in the absence of the defendant
15The Commission's motion was made returnable on 28 May 2012.  On that date, it was stood over to 5 June 2012, expressly with a view to being referred to the Duty Judge on that occasion.  The defendant was represented by a solicitor when that order was made.
16On 5 June 2012 the motion was referred to me as Duty Judge.  When the matter was called, Mr Yum, an employee of the solicitor on the record for the defendant, asserted that he was appearing as amicus curiae and sought an adjournment.
17I do not think it was correct for Mr Yum to say, when he first rose to his feet, that he was appearing as amicus curiae.  An appearance had been filed and the solicitor in question had not filed a notice of ceasing to act in accordance with the rules.  Whatever the position privately between the defendant and the solicitor, the solicitor remains on the record so far as the Court is concerned.
18The basis for the application for an adjournment was that an application for legal aid had recently been refused and the defendant had not paid the funds required by the solicitor on account of his fees.  I refused the adjournment.  In doing so, I had regard to the overriding purpose of the rules, the fact that the matter had previously been adjourned at the request of the defendant and the fact that the Commission, as an arm of the State, is required to act as a model litigant and was represented by experienced counsel of the highest integrity. 
19Upon my refusing the adjournment sought, Mr Yum sought leave under r 7.29 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 to file a notice of ceasing to act notwithstanding the fact that the defendant had not been given notice of the solicitor's intention to do so in accordance with the rules.  In the absence of any evidence in support of that application, I refused it.  In doing so, I noted that the rule is concerned only with the requirement of notice and the status of the solicitor in question as solicitor on the court record.  The refusal of such an application does not determine any question as to the propriety of the solicitor's terminating his retainer.  
20In the circumstances, I considered it appropriate to excuse Mr Yum from further attendance at the hearing and to proceed in the absence of the defendant.


Considerations against granting the relief sought
21Mr Bromwich SC, who appeared for the Commission, was properly frank in exposing reasons the Court may not be inclined to grant the relief sought.  He drew my attention to the decision of R S Hulme J in NSW Crime Commission v Lee [2011] NSWSC 80, which stands as authority against the present application.  In that case, the Commission sought examination orders against four defendants, two of whom had been charged with criminal offences.  It was not disputed that an examination in the terms ordered would permit questioning in respect of matters relevant to the criminal charges.  His Honour concluded that no examination orders should be made against those two defendants at that stage: at [21].
22Mr Bromwich informed me that the decision in Lee is the subject of an appeal which is due to be heard in August by the Court of Appeal with a bench of five.  I do not understand there to be any practice or policy that would require me to defer giving judgment in the present case on that account.
23Mr Bromwich submitted that Lee was wrongly decided.  The submission requires some explanation.
24In refusing to make the examination orders sought in respect of the two defendants who had been charged with criminal offences, Hulme J considered the decision of the High Court in Hammond v Commonwealth of Australia (1982) 152 CLR 188 and the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Australian Crime Commission v OK (2010) 185 FCR 258.  His Honour held at [20] that the circumstances before him were governed by the decision in Hammond rather than the decision in Australian Crime Commission v OK.  
25In Hammond, the High Court granted an injunction in its original jurisdiction to restrain the examination on oath of the plaintiff, Mr Hammond, at a Royal Commission until the hearing and determination of criminal charges against him.  The application was determined on an urgent basis.  Accordingly, the Court was constrained to assume, without deciding, that under the Royal Commissions Act 1902 (Cth) and the Evidence Act 1958 (Vict), a witness who refuses to answer a question relevant to an inquiry is guilty of an offence and that he is not entitled to refuse to answer on the ground that an answer might incriminate him (at 197.7 to 198.3 per Gibbs CJ; Mason J agreeing at 199; at 200.3 to 201.6 per Murphy J; at 202 per Brennan J; at 209 per Deane J).  
26On the assumptions made, the Court held that the continuance of Mr Hammond's examination before the Royal Commission would interfere with the due administration of justice, even though his answers would not be admissible in evidence against him in the criminal proceedings.
27In Australian Crime Commission v OK, the Full Court of the Federal Court was concerned with the question whether an examiner of the Australian Crime Commission conducting an examination under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) as part of an investigation into criminal activity could compel a witness to answer questions that related directly to criminal charges against that person in a State criminal court.  The Court held by majority that, on its true construction, the Act permits such an examination to continue so long as the protective prohibitions contemplated by ss 25A(3) and (9) have been put place: per Emmett and Jacobson JJ at [107]; Spender J dissenting at [12] to [13].
28The ""protective prohibitions"" relied upon in the reasoning of the majority provided that an examination before an examiner had to be held in private and allowed the examiner to give directions as to the persons who may be present during the examination (s 25A(3)) and, further, enabled an examiner to direct that any evidence given before the examiner must not be published or must not be published except in such manner and to such persons as the examiner specified (s 25A(9)).  It is on the basis of that reasoning that the Commission seeks orders 4 and 5 set out above in the present application.
29In Lee, the defendants argued, on the reasoning of the High Court in Hammond, that no orders could be made for the examination of the two defendants facing criminal charges, since such examinations would create a real risk of interference with the administration of justice.
30The Crime Commission responded by relying on the decision of the majority in Australian Crime Commission v OK and the provisions of ss 13A and 62 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.  Section 13A deals with the topic of privilege against self-incrimination.  The section expressly abrogates the privilege but provides that the answers given may not be used against the person in criminal proceedings (subject to the usual exception).  Importantly, however, the section does not confer derivative use immunity.
31The section in full provides:
13A Privilege against self-incrimination
(1) A person being examined under section 12 is not excused from answering any question, or from producing any document or other thing, on the ground that the answer or production might incriminate, or tend to incriminate, the person or make the person liable to forfeiture or penalty.
(2) However, any answer given or document produced by a natural person being examined under section 12 is not admissible in criminal proceedings (except proceedings for an offence under this Act or the regulations) if:
(a) the person objected at the time of answering the question or producing the document on the ground that the answer or document might incriminate the person, or(b) the person was not advised that the person might object on the ground that the answer or document might incriminate the person.
(3) Further information obtained as a result of an answer being given or the production of a document in an examination under section 12 is not inadmissible in criminal proceedings on the ground:
(a) that the answer had to be given or the document had to be produced, or(b) that the answer given or document produced might incriminate the person.
(4) A person directed by an order under section 12 to furnish a statement to the NSW Trustee and Guardian or the Commission is not excused from:
(a) furnishing the statement, or(b)setting out particulars in the statement, on the ground that the statement or particulars might incriminate, or tend to incriminate, the person or make the person liable to forfeiture or penalty.
(5) If a person furnishes a statement to the NSW Trustee and Guardian or the Commission in accordance with an order under section 12, the statement is not admissible against the person in any criminal proceedings except proceedings in respect of the false or misleading nature of the statement.
32The other section relied upon by the Commission in Lee was s 62 of the Act.  That section has since been repealed as part of the reforms introduced by the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010.  A power to afford like protection may be found in s 7 of that Act, which provides:
7 Power to make orders
A court may, by making a suppression order or non-publication order on grounds permitted by this Act, prohibit or restrict the publication or other disclosure of: 
(a) information tending to reveal the identity of or otherwise concerning any party to or witness in proceedings before the court or any person who is related to or otherwise associated with any party to or witness in proceedings before the court, or (b) information that comprises evidence, or information about evidence, given in proceedings before the court. 

33The reasoning of Hulme J hinged on the absence of derivative use immunity under s 13A of the Act.  His Honour said (at [19]):
No doubt the possibility that publication would run the risk of prejudicing the fair trial of a person examined under the Act would provide a strong reason for any court asked to make an order under s 62 to make one in sufficient width to minimise that risk.  However, there might be competing considerations and it cannot be said that s 62 goes as far as does s 25A of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) in requiring the relevant person to give a direction limiting publication if a failure to do so might prejudice a fair trial.
34It was on that basis that his Honour concluded that the circumstances of the application before him were governed by Hammond rather than by Australian Crime Commission v OK.  
35With great respect to R S Hulme J, I am not persuaded that any less protection was afforded to the fair trial of a person under the now-repealed s 62 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act than under s 25A(9) of the Australian Crime Commission Act.  Section 25A(9) circumscribes the power of an administrative investigator by mandating the giving of a direction prohibiting publication of evidence given before the examiner if the failure to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person charged with an offence.  It may be acknowledged that s 62 was not in mandatory terms, but the power under that section was to be exercised by the Supreme Court.  It may be taken as a given, in my respectful opinion, that the Court would make a direction prohibiting publication of evidence given during an examination in any case in which the failure to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person charged with a criminal offence.    
36I would respectfully conclude that the protection provided under s 25A(9) of the Australian Crime Commission Act and the protection now contained in section 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act are, for all practical purposes, indistinguishable.
37It does not follow, however, that I would adopt the reasoning of the majority in Australian Crime Commission v OK in determining the present application. That decision concerns a different statutory regime and is not binding in the present case.  
38My conclusions on those issues leave open the critical question to be determined in this case, which is whether an examination order under s 31D(1)(a) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act would create a real risk of interference with the administration of justice if made against a person facing criminal charges in respect of the same matters.  
39In concluding that it would, Hulme J in Lee was not taken to the case of Hamilton v Oades, which was decided by the High Court after Hammond: (1989) 166 CLR 486.  It may be noted that the Full Court of the Federal Court was also not taken to Hamilton v Oades when it decided Australian Crime Commission v OK. 
Consideration of Hamilton v Oades  
40Hamilton v Oades was concerned with s 541 of the Companies (NSW) Code, which conferred power on the Court to order a person to attend Court to be examined in relation to the affairs of a company, including where it appeared the person may have been guilty of fraud, negligence, default, breach of trust, breach of duty or other misconduct in relation to the relevant company.  
41Section 541(5) of the Code provided:
The Court, on making an order for an examination, or at any later time, on the application of any person concerned, may give such directions as to the matters to be inquired into, and, subject to sub-section (4), as to the procedure to be followed (including, in the case of an examination in private, directions as to the persons who may be present), as it thinks fit.
42Mr Oades was facing 19 criminal charges in relation to the affairs of a company.  He sought a direction under s 541(5) that the examination be restricted to matters which were not the subject of the pending criminal proceedings against him.  The High Court held that s 541(12) of the Code abrogated the common law privilege against self incrimination and, accordingly, that neither s 541(5) nor the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to control its own proceeding authorised the Court to reject a question, or relieve a person from the duty to answer it, only on the ground that the answer may tend to incriminate the person.  
43Mason CJ said (at 497.2):
In the light of the statutory provisions and the public purposes which I have outlined, it would be going too far altogether to view the existence of the discretion [under section 541(5)] as requiring ordinarily the giving of directions which will protect the witness from the consequences of abrogation of the privilege insofar as they include the derivative use of the answers of the witness.  To give such directions as a matter of course would be to frustrate the statutory purpose.  Clearly the lengthy delay of an examination due to the pendency of criminal charges would be highly likely to frustrate the liquidator in the carrying out of his duties towards the company and the creditors by denying him the use of a major instrument in the tracing of assets.
44Dawson and Toohey JJ adopted similar reasoning (at pages 508 and 515 respectively). Dawson J considered the passage of the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Hammond where it was concluded that there was a real risk that the administration of justice would be interfered with.  His Honour observed that those remarks were preceded by an observation as to the urgency with which the case was determined.  
45Dawson J also observed that, in Hammond, earlier relevant authorities were not discussed, including Rees v Kratzmann (1965) 114 CLR 63 and Mortimer v Brown & Beames (1970) 122 CLR 493.  Those decisions considered the proper scope of a public examination under s 250 of the Companies Act 1961 (Qld) in circumstances where the examinee had been or faced the prospect of being charged with criminal offences.
46Interestingly, Windeyer J in Rees traced the emergence of powers of compulsory interrogation in the public interest to the Chancery Court, where ""the cherished view of English lawyers that their methods are more just than are the inquisitional procedures of other countries"" had ""less place"": at 80.4.
47In Mortimer, the High Court held that an examinee under s 250 of The Companies Act may not decline to answer a question on the ground that the answer may tend to incriminate him.  The judgments in that case give sober recognition to the obligation of the court to construe a statute so as to give effect to the clear intention of the legislature and without sentimental regard for any incursion upon centuries of closely guarded notions of criminal justice.             
48Toohey J in Hamilton v Oades expressly adopted the reasoning of Barwick CJ in Mortimer and expressed the view that the decision of the High Court in Hammond does not stand in the way of that approach (at 515).
49It would plainly have assisted Hulme J in determining the Commission's application in Lee to be taken to the decision in Hamilton v Oades and the earlier authorities discussed in that case.  Such assistance might also have produced different reasoning, if not a different result, in Australian Crime Commission v OK.  
50My consideration of Hamilton v Oades and the earlier authorities there discussed has led me to the conclusion that I should not decline the relief sought by the Commission only on the basis that the orders sought will require the defendant to give verified answers as to matters relevant to the criminal charges against him.  In my respectful opinion, Lee was wrongly decided (in the circumstance identified) and should not be followed.
51The Criminal Assets Recovery Act is replete with unambiguous indications that Parliament intended the Commission to be able to pursue confiscation orders notwithstanding the existence of pending criminal proceedings and with the aid of powers that would infringe upon a defendant's right to remain silent.
52As already noted, the objects of the Act expressly contemplate the pursuit of confiscation orders without requiring a conviction.  Section 13A (set out above) clearly contemplates the conduct of an examination in circumstances in which self-incrimination may occur.  There is no need to draw any inference as to Parliament's intention in that respect, as the High Court was prepared to do in Mortimer.  The Act expressly abrogates the privilege and provides compensatory protection against direct use of the answers given.  Whether to extend that protection to derivative use was a matter for Parliament, which it also addressed (s 13A(3)).  Examination orders under s 31D are governed by those provisions (s 31D(3)) and so must also be taken to have been intended to be available in the face of pending criminal proceedings.  It is also significant that the existence of criminal proceedings is not a ground on which this Court may stay proceedings under the Act: s 62.
53The risk of interference with the administration of justice must be assessed in that statutory context.  In his dissenting judgment in Australian Crime Commission v OK, Spender J said (at [13]):
In my judgment, whether the quarantining of information from those authorities is successfully able to be done is not the determining question.  It is the compulsory interrogation of a person facing a criminal charge about that criminal charge, whether quarantined or not, that constitutes the interference with the administration of justice.  (emphasis in original) 
54However, as was acknowledged by the High Court in Hamilton v Oades, the legislature can authorise the compulsory interrogation of a person facing a criminal charge about matters relevant to that charge.  As unpalatable as it may be to a common lawyer, the right to resist such interrogation invoking the privilege against self-incrimination is precisely what Parliament has abrogated by the legislation.  It is the duty of the court to give effect to such legislation, which informs the assessment as to what the interests of the administration of justice demand. 
55That is not to say that the court must always accede to an application by the Commission for ancillary relief.  The making of orders under s 31D is discretionary, but the discretion must be exercised having regard to the objects of the Act.  Without purporting to be exhaustive or prescriptive, I would have thought that the court could properly consider declining to make an order against a child or other vulnerable person or at a time so close to a jury trail that the conduct of the examination might impede the defendant's preparation for the trial.
56It must also be acknowledged that the court is not without power to protect the interests of the defendant in other ways.  Foremost among the protections available are the powers of the Court under the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act and s 71 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005.  Further, the Court can and should be vigilant to contain the questioning within the scope of the examination authorised under the legislation: cf Hamilton v Oades per Dawson J at 510.9.
57I have concluded, however, that it would not be appropriate to refuse to make the orders sought only on the basis that the examination would compel the defendant to answer questions relevant to the criminal proceedings against him.  To do so would frustrate the clear purpose of the legislation.
58For those reasons, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make orders in the terms of orders 1 to 3 sought by the Commission.  I will ask the Commission to bring in short minutes of order in accordance with these reasons.**********

		02 August 2012",2012-06-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759468,Di Maria v R [2012] NSWCCA 127,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The appellant was convicted following a trial with a jury of murder. He has appealed his conviction. 

2The trial commenced in June 2009 and when the jury had been empanelled the trial judge gave the jurors the usual direction about not discussing the trial with any person.

3Later in 2009 the solicitors for the appellant made a request that the Sheriff investigate an issue relating to one member of the jury. The solicitors had received instructions to the effect that a member of the jury may have relied upon information gained from a person who did not give evidence in the trial. The letter annexed an affidavit from Francesca Ussia, a former girlfriend of the appellant. At the time of the appellant's trial Ms Ussia was in a relationship with Mr Andrew Lippett. Mr Lippett was a neighbour of a juror. 

4Ms Ussia did not give evidence in the trial. In her affidavit she deposed that to the best of her knowledge the juror and Mr Lippett were friends and neighbours and had been for a number of years. Ms Ussia also stated that Mr Lippett had told her that her neighbour, who was the juror, was on jury duty and that it was in relation to the appellant's case. Mr Lippett also said to Ms Ussia that the juror ""said to me that Joshua's ex girlfriend gave evidence in the trial today."" The following day Ms Ussia attended the trial as an observer and said that she recognised the juror concerned.

5Some time later when a different solicitor was acting for the appellant the Sheriff was requested when investigating the matter to have regard to MFI 13 at the trial. This was a jury note which read as follows:

""1. About Joshua's girlfriend: not only did she not tell all story, most of time, she was telling lie, why Crown did not try to find out?

2. May we get Crown's opening case note.""

6The MFI also indicated that this was an issue raised by only one juror. 

7The request for an investigation was referred to me by the Sheriff. I decided that the matter should be investigated.

8Subsequently Ms Ussia swore a further affidavit. In that affidavit she stated the following matters:

(a) she recalls an occasion when she told the appellant that she would not disclose that a friend of Lippett's was on the jury because she did not wish them to get the juror ""in trouble"";

(b) on one occasion Mr Lippett accused her of being ""the x [sic] girlfriend who gave evidence at Joshua's trial"";

(c) after the appellant was convicted she told Mr Lippett that she was going to disclose that the juror was on the jury. This caused a fight. Lippett told her that the juror was ""a good bloke"" and ""did nothing wrong"" (annexure D to the affidavit of Frances Low affirmed 14 March 2012; affidavit of Francesca Ussia sworn 28 October 2010 at [6]); and

(d) she is ""aware"" that Lippett spoke to the juror after their fight.

9The relevant juror was interviewed. He indicated that he knew Mr Lippett and considered him a friend. However, he did not know Ms Ussia but accepted that he may know of her. He said he had never met her. He said that he did not discuss the evidence in the appellant's trial with any person outside the jury room. He said the he bumped into Mr Lippett on the way to the trial one day and ""he asked me where I was going and I said, I didn't mention anything about the trial. I said I was going to court, it was jut a pure coincidence that he knew about the same case, but I didn't mention anything about the case."" He said he did not tell anyone that he had spoken to Mr Lippett and none of the jurors knew about Ms Ussia.

10Although the Sheriff endeavoured to interview Mr Lippett this has not occurred.

11In relation to the jury note the juror who was interviewed recalled that another juror was the author of MFI 13. He gave the investigating Sheriff's officer information about the discussions in the jury room relating to the issues raised in the note.

12Section 53B of the Jury Act provides the circumstances in which an individual juror may be discharged. Illness or infirmity are dealt with. Section 53B(b) provides that a juror may be discharged where it appears to the court that a juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror's familiarity with the witnesses. Section 53B(d) provides that a court may also discharge a juror for any reason affecting the juror's ability to perform the functions of a juror.

13Where an irregularity occurs in the conduct of a trial by reason of the conduct or circumstances relating to a particular juror the Court of Criminal Appeal may intervene and quash the conviction. However, the court will only intervene if a miscarriage of justice has occurred: Domican v R (No 3) (1990) 46 A Crim R 428. Where it is alleged that there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of the apprehension of bias in a juror the test to be applied is the same as that applicable to an apprehension of bias on the part of a judge: Webb v R [1994] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 68-69; McCormack v R [2007] NSWCCA 78.

14The appellant has by Notice of Motion brought the matter before a single judge of the court seeking a directions hearing, prior to the hearing of the appeal, so that orders be made and directions given, if appropriate, ""concerning a requested examination before the court of relevant witnesses in relation to an issue of possible jury irregularity during the trial of the appellant.""

15The appellant submitted that the process of investigation by the Sheriff had been dilatory. It was further submitted that it was apparent from the information which the Sheriff has elicited that the juror and Mr Lippett did speak to each other and that they must have discussed what was occurring in the trial and that accordingly an opportunity to ask further questions of Mr Lippett, Ms Ussia and the juror may elicit information which discloses a miscarriage of justice.

16I am satisfied that Mr Lippett and the juror must have discussed some matters which were occurring in the trial. This also obviously included a discussion of the fact that the appellant's former girlfriend had given evidence. To this extent it is apparent that the juror has departed from the direction given by the trial judge not to discuss the trial with any person.

17The Sheriff's officer who investigated the matter formed the view that there may possibly be unsatisfactory responses from the juror who may not have been entirely truthful about the situation. This may be explained by the juror's embarrassment at being interviewed about matters which a juror would have recognised breached his obligations. The Sheriff's officer also concluded that Ms Ussia may have overstated her knowledge of the circumstances in an attempt to support the concerns raised by the appellant's solicitor.

18Notwithstanding that the Sheriff was unable to complete his investigation by reason of the fact that Mr Lippett has apparently not cooperated I am not persuaded that the orders sought should be made.

19The issue in relation to MFI 13 has been satisfactorily resolved. Investigation confirms that it was written by a juror other than the juror who spoke to Mr Lippett. 

20With respect to Ms Ussia, both the juror and Ms Ussia agree that they have never met or spoken to each other. Although Ms Ussia says that she was told of a discussion between the juror and Mr Lippett, apart from the fact that an identified person had given evidence that day, there is nothing to suggest that anything passed between them which could have affected the juror's impartial participation in the jury's deliberations. There is nothing to suggest that there was a discussion between the juror and Mr Lippett of the evidence.

21In the event although there is evidence of an association between the juror and Mr Lippett I am not satisfied that there is evidence which would justify the making of orders for the cross-examination of the relevant persons. As counsel conceded, all that his instructions would allow him to do if cross-examination was allowed would be to put a question seeking to elicit an account of the events which occurred. There is nothing to suggest that this would bring forward evidence demonstrating that a miscarriage of justice had taken place.

22In the circumstances I am not persuaded that there is a legitimate forensic reason for making the orders sought by the appellant. The Notice of Motion is dismissed.

2759492,"R v MITCHELL, Grant David [2012] NSWSC 694","REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1The offender, Grant David Mitchell, has pleaded guilty to the murder of his partner, Nella Poli, at their home in Zetland on 12 May 1987. It is common ground that the basis for murder is that the killing was done with reckless indifference to human life. 

Facts

2The offender and Ms Poli, both of them natives of New Zealand, had been in a relationship for about 8 months. In the weeks leading up to her death Ms Poli had spoken to friends and family about leaving him. 


3In the evening of 12 May 1987, the offender and Ms Poli were at home together. Early in the evening they had had sex. However, later an argument developed between them and there was a physical altercation. Around his neck the offender was wearing a pendant attached to a gold chain which Ms Poli had given him. As they struggled, she pulled the pendant from the chain and put it in her mouth. He grabbed her around the neck with his hands and then used a pair of pantyhose as a ligature in an attempt to make her cough the pendant up. They fell to the floor in the doorway between the lounge room and a downstairs bedroom. He straddled her as she lay on her back and held a pillow over her face to quieten her. Shortly afterwards, she stopped struggling but he continued to hold the pillow over her face. He then blacked out for a period. 

4When he regained consciousness, he found that she had stopped breathing and had no pulse, and her face appeared blotchy. He carried her to the master bedroom upstairs. There he removed the jeans she was wearing and placed her on the bed. He covered her with a doona. He went back downstairs, where there was a photo of the two of them. He removed their faces from the photo, and placed two pins in the photo where Ms Poli's eyes had been. 

5This account is a brief summary of what the offender told police many years later, when he was finally apprehended. It is consistent with the observations of a neighbour who went to the house the evening after the murder and found the deceased, and of police who attended the scene. She was seen to be lying on the bed underneath the doona, she was wearing undergarments, and she had marks around her neck. The photo was seen to have been defaced in the way the offender described. A post-mortem examination carried out the following day led to the conclusion that the cause of death was strangulation. However, that post-mortem examination was reviewed by a forensic pathologist in November 2011, and that pathologist found that it was not possible to say whether strangulation or suffocation was the more likely cause of death.

6Having left the house after the killing, the offender caught a train to Katoomba. There he contemplated committing suicide and destroyed his personal identification. He lived in the bush for a time, and then got a job in the Emu Plains area under a false name. With the introduction of the compulsory tax file number system, he fled to far north Queensland. There he worked on and off, doing manual labour for cash payment. He maintained this transient lifestyle, using three different aliases and avoiding police detection. A warrant for his arrest had been issued on 1 March 1988 but, despite numerous enquiries, police were unable to locate him. 

7On 9 January 2011, he attended the police station at Atherton in Queensland, and surrendered himself. He told police that he was wanted for a murder committed in New South Wales in 1987. He said that he had had an argument with his girlfriend, at the end of it she was dead, and he had been on the run ever since. He took part in a recorded interview with Queensland detectives, saying that during an altercation with Ms Poli he had smothered her with a pillow. He told them about the circumstances of the killing and his subsequent actions to avoid apprehension. 

8He took part in a further recorded interview with New South Wales police, in which he gave a detailed account of the killing. Extracts from that interview are set out in an agreed statement of facts which I received, but it is unnecessary to go to that detail in these remarks. In the Queensland interview he said that he did not intend to kill Ms Poli or to cause her serious harm, but he acknowledged that when he realised what he had done he took no steps to seek any medical assistance for her or to notify authorities. 

Victim impact statement

9I received a victim impact statement by Ms Poli's mother, Ms Caroline Ann McGill. It is a moving expression of her grief and outrage at the violent death of her daughter, and the enduring effects this tragedy has had upon her and her family. The opening words of the statement are telling:

""I am under no illusion that the sentence imposed will reflect the depth of feeling and impact of Nella's death on our immediate and extended family and all those who knew and loved Nella. The totality of our loss and grief is impossible to express.""

10I extend my deepest sympathy to Ms McGill, to her family and to all those affected by this tragic event. 

Subjective case

11The offender was 37 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 62. He has no criminal history. As I have said, he was born in New Zealand. He appears to have had an unremarkable upbringing there. It was not without its difficulties, but they are not significant for present purposes. He finished High School, and was consistently in employment in New Zealand, as he was when he came to this country. He married in New Zealand and the union produced two children, who are now adults. The marriage did not endure. 

12I have the benefit of a psychological assessment, which provides insight into aspects of his background and personality functioning. However, the results of psychological testing disclose nothing bearing upon this sentencing exercise. To the psychologist the offender acknowledged that there had been difficulties in his relationship with Ms Poli but he said, and I accept, that prior to the offence there had never been any physical violence.

13The offender presented a handwritten statement to me in which he expressed his remorse for his crime in heartfelt terms. I accept that expression as genuine. It is consistent with his plea of guilty. While the matter was in the Local Court he offered to plead guilty to manslaughter. When that offer was refused he pleaded guilty to murder, still in the Local Court. His surrendering to the police is also consistent with his remorse. It may be, as the Crown prosecutor suggested, that he had reached a stage where he could no longer endure life as a fugitive. However, even if that be so, I accept that he was also motivated to acknowledge his guilt and face his punishment. The Crown prosecutor fairly submitted that he was entitled to a 25% reduction of sentence for the utilitarian value of his plea.

14I received some impressive testimonials about the offender's character. A letter from a Queensland couple, who knew him under an assumed name, painted him as a loyal and caring friend. He had effectively become part of their family, and they appreciated his support in their coping with difficulties experienced by their children. Significantly, I also received letters from his former wife and his daughter, both of whom still live in New Zealand. Despite the breakdown of their marriage, his wife described him as ""trustworthy, gentle and loving."" His daughter's letter is a moving document, describing the process of her re-establishing contact with him after not having seen him since she was a child. She noted that in her many conversations with him about the offence he never said anything derogatory about Ms Poli, but always spoke of her respectfully. She expressed herself to be fortunate to have forged a relationship with him and described them as having ""an ongoing friendship."" 

15He, of course, is equally fortunate to have found this family support. Clearly, his prospects of rehabilitation are good. He had not been in conflict with the law before the offence, and had not come under adverse notice in the many years after the offence during which he was at large. I think it most unlikely that he would re-offend. 

Sentence

16None of this is to deny the seriousness of his crime. A killing done with reckless indifference to human life is not necessarily less serious than one accompanied by an intent to kill or to cause serious injury. An assessment of the culpability of any murder turns on the facts of the case at hand. In sentencing this offender it is significant that the offence occurred in a domestic setting, as the courts recognise the need to impose deterrent sentences in cases of domestic violence. While I have found that he is unlikely to re-offend, general deterrence remains an important consideration. On the other hand, it is clear that this killing was spontaneous, without an intention to kill or inflict serious injury, in the heat of an altercation and a struggle. Moreover, it was an episode of violence which appears to be entirely uncharacteristic of him. 

17As the offence was committed in 1987, it is necessary to have regard to the practice and pattern of sentence for murder at that time: R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129, 54 NSWLR 368. There was then no standard non-parole period for the offence. By s 19 of the Crimes Act 1900, the prima facie sentence for murder was imprisonment for life, that is, an indeterminate sentence with a prospect of release on licence. However, a court could impose a determinate sentence if it appeared that the offender's culpability for the crime was ""significantly diminished by mitigating circumstances."" The present sentencing regime for murder (apart from the standard non-parole period) was introduced into the Crimes Act in 1990 by s 19A, providing that the discretion for sentence for murder is at large, with imprisonment for life, which now means the term of the offender's natural life, being the maximum sentence. Provision was made for offenders serving life sentences under the old regime to apply to this court for a re-determination of the sentence, and the court could impose a determinate sentence or could specify a non-parole period while preserving the life sentence.

18I have been assisted by a Judicial Commission monograph, ""Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales, 1990 - 1993"", supplied by counsel for the offender, Mr Winch. The cases examined revealed that the majority of offenders dealt with under s 19 of the Crimes Act received life sentences. Of the cases where the requisite mitigating circumstances were found, sentences ranged from 10 to 16 years, with non-parole periods of 8 to 12 years. More assistance is to be gained from determinate sentences passed in the early years of the s 19A regime. The monograph revealed that the majority of offenders received a sentence greater than 14 years and up to 20 years. The average non-parole period was 12 years, with about half of the cases falling within the range of 10 to 15 years. A sentence of 18 years with a minimum term of 12 years was described as ""the typical sentence for murder under s 19A.""

19Of the cases under s 19 in which determinate sentences were passed, only one was a plea of guilty. However, of the cases under s 19A more than a third were pleas of guilty. However, an analysis of the data found that there was no clear difference in sentences between the cases where there had been a plea of guilty and where there had not. The authors of the monograph suggest that this may be attributable to the fact that a plea of guilty does not automatically attract a lesser sentence because of the serious nature of the offence. Of course, some of those may have been cases in which the facts were particularly serious, so that, even though leniency was extended for the plea of guilty, the sentences did not depart markedly from the general trend. However that may be, it was not the practice then to arrive at a sentence as a starting point and specify a proportion by which it had been reduced because of the plea of guilty. The current practice of expressly discounting a sentence on account of a plea of guilty finds its origin in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383. In the present case the offender should have the benefit of that practice, even though it had not been developed at the time of the offence.

20In setting a non-parole period, it should also be noted that at that time there was no legislation prescribing a statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. The discretion to determine the length of the non-parole period in each case was at large. If the offender had been dealt with under s 19 and had received a life sentence, there is little doubt that an application for re-determination of that sentence would have led to the imposition of a determinate sentence. That sentence could be expected to have fallen within the range of sentences under s 19A. By then legislation imposing a statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period would have been in force, but it did not apply to life sentence re-determinations. 

21Having regard to all of the circumstances, I have concluded that the appropriate starting point for sentence is a term of imprisonment for 18 years. A reduction of that sentence of roughly 25% in recognition of the plea of guilty produces a term of 14 years. I shall set a non-parole period of 10 years. Despite the features of the case favourable to the offender, I do not believe that a lesser non-parole period would be sufficient to reflect his criminality. The sentence will date from the day of his arrest, 9 January 2011. 

22Grant David Mitchell, for the murder of Nella Poli you are sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years, to date from 9 January 2011. You will eligible for release on parole on 8 January 2021.

6It is necessary, in order to understand the way these complaints have been brought by the HCCC and how they have been particularised, to have reference to s 144 of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW) No 86a:

144 Grounds for complaint about registered health practitioner [NSW]

The following complaints may be made about a registered health practitioner- 

(a) Criminal conviction or criminal findingA complaint the practitioner has, either in this jurisdiction or elsewhere, been convicted of or made the subject of a criminal finding for an offence.
(b) Unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconductA complaint the practitioner has been guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct.
(c) Lack of competenceA complaint the practitioner is not competent to practise the practitioner's profession.
(d) ImpairmentA complaint the practitioner has an impairment.
(e) Suitable personA complaint the practitioner is otherwise not a suitable person to hold registration in the practitioner's profession.

7Complaint One is a recitation of criminal convictions entered against the doctor in the District Court of NSW. This complaint was brought in accordance with the provision of s 144(a) of the National Law.

Complaint One is admitted.

8Complaint Two and Complaint Three are complaints that assert under s 144(b), given those criminal convictions, the doctor has been guilty of unsatisfactory conduct (see s 139B definition) or professional misconduct (see s 139E definition). The doctor contends, as he was not a medical practitioner at the time of the offences, it cannot be held that the complaints are ""relevant to the practice of medicine"" (s 139) and Complaints Two and Three therefore cannot be established.

9Complaint Four contends the doctor, given the convictions, is otherwise not a suitable person to hold registration as a medical practitioner under s 144(e). The doctor contends, given the particular circumstance, the Tribunal would be satisfied he is a suitable person to practice medicine. If the Tribunal so found and given he has admitted six assault charges over a period of time, given the priority under the Act to the protection of the public, the doctor agrees that conditions be placed upon his practice of medicine to protect the public.

Background
10The circumstances surrounding the particularised criminal convictions came to light in 2007. At the time of the offences the victims were aged 13 years or 14 years and the practitioner was not then a doctor. He was about 26 years of age and not in medical school. The doctor and the two victims were brothers; he the biological son of the parents; the two brothers were adopted. After the original investigation took place and he made admissions, the doctor then volunteered that a similar allegation could be made upon the second victim (who was deceased). Once the allegation was belatedly brought to the attention of the authorities by the brother's wife and the charges were laid, the doctor pleaded guilty to the offences at the first opportunity. It was the doctor who, in admitting the reported offence, revealed the conduct/assault was also on his deceased brother. The offences are outlined in Complaint One.

11The District Court, in sentencing, commented the offences, while establishing a breach of trust, were at the lower end of the scale of offences of that nature notwithstanding the seriousness of each offence.

12Evidence established the first victim had, through life, been given considerable support including financial support by the doctor. When that financial support ceased the allegation was brought to the attention of the authorities. The seriousness of each conviction is acknowledged by the doctor and his remorse and contrition has been reflected in his early plea and co-operation with authorities. He has continually sought to support the brother aware of the damage caused.

13Dr A spent his childhood in Sydney and the Blue Mountains. His home life was chaotic. The home was occupied by his parents and seven natural siblings and four adopted siblings. Both parents had mental health issues: his father also had episodic heavy drinking with accompanying violence. The doctor, for approximately four years, studied for the priesthood and then worked for the Police Service and Ambulance Service before, in 1983, enrolling at University in the school of Architecture. He then transferred to Medicine the following year. He graduated in 1989 and served his hospital residency. He practised as a General Practitioner in the Blue Mountains. He married, had a family then moved his own family, for health reasons, to a northern districts inland community where he set up a general practice. He has practised medicine as a General Practitioner for some 23 years without complaint.

14After charges were laid and he pleaded guilty and was convicted in August 2010, the doctor published an ""announcement"" of that conviction to the local community. The Medical Council was notified and it was determined to refer the issue to the Medical Tribunal. The doctor has had conditions placed on his practice which require, for any consultations with children, that the child be accompanied by a chaperone. The doctor had already initiated this procedure once charges were laid and the Medical Council endorsed that decision by way of making it a condition on his Practising Certificate.

15The doctor, in his consideration as to his past and present sexuality says:

... From my own perspective I consider that as a 26 year old in 1976 I was a very immature and inexperienced person, with confused feelings about sexuality. In saying this I do not seek to in any way minimise the seriousness of the offences I committed at that time. However it is the case that my maturity and my feelings changed very significantly over the following years.

21. The process of obtaining enough financial independence to study full time, to then re-sit the HSC and then embark on university studies involved a major personal struggle. A turning point was when I resolved in about 1979 to cease drinking to excess. I then became single-minded about doing well at university and trying to make something of my life. By the time I qualified to commence practice as a doctor at the age of 38 I had met my wife (to whom I am still married) and I had no interest in any other kind of sexual relationship or activity.

16Dr Jeremy O'Dea, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, prepared a report for the sentencing hearing following the doctor entering the plea on the criminal charges. The doctor opined:

37.... it would also seem prudent and reasonable that Dr [A] take the opportunity to explore in further detail with a suitably qualified and experienced psychiatrist or psychologist, his sexuality in general and his history of homosexual paedophilia in particular, with the aim of assisting him to continue to manage these issues in a more formal setting. Formal reference to his history of alcohol abuse, depression and OCD style symptoms of the past should be a part of this process.

38.This treatment option could be organised and implemented in the community without placing the community at undue risk.

17Dr Anthony Samuels, Consultant Psychiatrist, gave an opinion to the Medical Council on 4 May 2011. He opined:

I would see his risk of offending in the context of his medical practice as being very low particularly if he is chaperoned. I think he does very much value his life and lifestyle in northern NSW and his ability to provide and to work as a medical practitioner and I feel reasonably confident that he would not take any steps that would jeopardise his situation.

I would see his conditions at the present time as being entirely appropriate and I think he should have continuing regular contact with his treating psychiatrist. I think there are considerable psychiatric and psychological issues that need to be explored. He is not currently psychiatrically ill and I would see no indication for any form of antidepressant, anti-anxiety or antipsychotic medication but, certainly, if he began to explore issues in depth from his childhood; his own abuse or the events that occurred with his brothers, there is a high likelihood that he could develop a marked emotional response to that. I think it would be appropriate for him to continue to see the Council nominated psychiatrist on at least a 6 monthly basis, as well as yet another safeguard.

18He further opined on 2 November 2011:

1.Psychiatric Issues
As far as I can ascertain Dr A is very stable in terms of his mood state, there is no evidence of depression or anxiety, no evidence of obsessive compulsive phenomena and I can find no evidence of psychotic features. He assures me that he has no deviant sexual fantasisation. He also feels that any homosexual inclinations he had in the past are no longer. He certainly endeavoured to express remorse in relation to what happened in the context of my interview today.

My diagnostic perspective is unchanged. I accept what he says in terms of the paedophilic sexual fantasies no longer being present but there remains at least a theoretical risk that, under particular conditions of stress or adversity, such thoughts or feelings could re-emerge. I nevertheless continue to regard him as being at an extremely low risk of repeating his offences particularly in the context of his medical practice at the present time.

2.Recommendations
I would see his conditions as being appropriate and I would see them as needing to remain in place for the foreseeable future.

19The respondent doctor was asked to comment as to Dr Samuel's opinion:

Q.He goes on to say he nevertheless regards you as being at extremely low risk of reoffending. The conditions you describe of your work, because of your level of commitment and concern for your patients, appear to involve a significant level of stress. You start early in the morning, finish late at night and you haven't taken a holiday in 3 years. Do you perceive there's a risk if you keep operating like that, that's a high pressure stressful environment?

The doctor answered:

A.I have my own ways of adjusting to that. I'd love to get a locum, it would be nice to have a break. If things are getting busy or I've been out at night, I'll ask the girls, ""Don't take any bookings for this particular afternoon, we need a bit of time off"", and we poke away in the garden or go for a drive or something. Occasionally I'll take the phone off the hook for an hour. It's just a - I don't like taking it out for too long because you never know what's going to happen. There are mechanisms to take control of the situation.

20As to his risk of re-offending, the doctor was directly asked:

Q.I want to ask you about the risk of reoffending you've already been asked about. Mr O'Dea as you understand, categorised your risk of reoffending as low?
A.Yes.

Q.Dr Samuels categorised it as low in one part, and extremely low somewhere else?
A.Yes.

Q.What do you say your risk of reoffending is?
A.I won't reoffend. I will not reoffend. It will not happen.

21The doctor assures the Tribunal he has not, for over 30 years, nor will he ever re-offend.

22Further, in revealing the nature of his practice, the doctor explained he services a large aboriginal community and, as well, a needy local community. He works very long hours. He ensures the conditions, self imposed but endorsed by the Medical Council, are complied with. However, because of the isolation of his inland communities and the lack of public transport, sometimes in emergencies (for example, home violence circumstance), mothers and children were, and still are, harbored in his home overnight on occasions, often at the instigation of his wife, a trained Veterinarian who is now a teacher. It appears, within the communities, she is empathetic and acts in a social worker capacity. Having heard explanations on this point, the Tribunal expressed its concern that this, perhaps well intentioned harboring, even where there is a remote element to the communities he services, causes the doctor to transgress over the boundaries necessary to maintain a professional and clinical relationship with his patients.

23Another issue arose from the doctor's description of his practice. He was asked:

Q.From a personal point of view in terms of having other things in your life, what do you say for that?
A.I've talked with Richardson about this tendency to make medicine the be-all and end-all of life and I acknowledge his concerns about that. I do enjoy gardening, I try to get out as much as I can. I love my family and enjoy my family as much as I can.

24As to his personal life, the doctor revealed his wife is now teaching and loves the work. The children are growing up and he intends to and accepts the advice that he should ""slow down"".

25Because of the issues that arose as to the ""boundaries"" required in the professional conduct of his practice and given the workload the doctor described (including his long hours of clinical consultation each week), the Tribunal members asked the doctor about his continuing medical education. The doctor replied:

A.That can always be a difficulty, getting one's brownie points to fulfil the requirements for the triennium to keep one's vocational registration etcetera going. Though I have a number of options, I occasionally attend. It's difficult to do that, but I manage each time to do so.

The doctor uses registered nurses in his practice. He does not use ""nurse practitioners"" even though they would assist him in his workload and also attract extra payments to his practice. He revealed he is not an accredited practitioner. When asked why, the doctor stated he thought accreditation was ""balderdash"".

26The doctor has an arrangement with the Pharmaceutical Board to dispense some medications from his practice. When questioned by the Tribunal, it was revealed:

A. I spend most the majority of my patients I've managed over time, to be able to convince people to make a relationship with the chemist when they are in town. It has really helped, the Close the Gap situation has really helped with that because they don't have to find money. It may not seem a great deal amount of money, but if you're on the pension or supporting mother's benefit, and you're diabetic and you've got four or five or six medications at $5 or $6 a pop, it mounts up to substantial money; $30 to $40 a go, and you don't have it.

and:

A. The arrangements with this is that the Pharmaceutical Services Board, if I write a script for something and send that in, it goes off to the ether somewhere, and you send it off to Medicare, Sydney 2000, Post Office box somewhere, and back it comes eventually some months later.

Q. I'm suggesting that you fax a script to the local pharmacy and that pharmacy sends out the prescription to you, back to the patient. Meantime you've given enough medication short-term to tide them over. I'm interested in terms of your financial outlay. It's just a huge outlay, I would have imagined for you to be supporting the local population?
A. It does mount up and my wife has raised the point it has cost us $200,000 at least, over the years. It's one of those things one does. It would be a little complicated I think, that arrangement, with the - it will come back with - the functional patients. I'll bear that in mind. ...

27Since the federal government introduced the ""Closing the Gap"" scheme, aboriginal people are able to obtain their PBS prescription medication for no fee. The doctor appreciated the issue that he was giving medication he had bought to patients who could obtain it for no fee. To support the community in this way is not only a financial burden for the doctor but has little or no financial benefit for patients. The Tribunal notes the community has access to a pharmacy within an hour's drive. There are few medical conditions which cannot wait an hour's drive for a prescription to be dispensed and treatment initiated. 

28The doctor gave evidence he was in good health. Once a week he visits the North Coast and has a close friend, a Medical Practitioner, with whom he can discuss professional and personal issues. He values this friendship, respects and generally complies with the advice given.

29After the doctor gave his evidence and faced rigorous cross-examination, counsel for the HCCC in addresses conceded:

... there are a significant number of mitigating factors put forward on behalf of the respondent during the sentencing process and they are accepted. First the expression of genuine remorse and I was keen to clarify that given the comments of Doctor Samuels in the report of May 2011 which were concerning at first blush but they do seem to have been clarified that there is a significant level of remorse expressed by the respondent and certainly a very significant period of demonstrated rehabilitation and the Commission accepts, your Honour, that the work of the respondent is very important work and that he seems to display a very significant level of devotion and care to the particular community that he serves.

30Given the facts recited in Complaint One are agreed, Complaint One is established.

31The first issue raised is whether, in the circumstances, the criminal convictions lay the ground for a finding under s 144 the doctor is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct as pleaded in Complaint Two and Complaint Three. Complaint Two, therefore, contends because of the convictions the doctor is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct under s 144(b). Complaint Three asserts that because of the convictions the doctor is guilty of professional misconduct under s 144(b). The reference in Complaint Two to s 139B is a reference to the definition of ""unsatisfactory conduct"". The reference in Complaint Three to s 139E is a reference to the definition of ""professional misconduct"".

32Counsel for the doctor contends under the provision of the Act, particularly s 139B and s 139E, the doctor is required to be a member of the profession at the time of the offences. It is pleaded that ""the doctor engaged in improper or unethical conduct relating to the practice of medicine"". Section 139B of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW) No 86a relevantly states:

139B Meaning of ""unsatisfactory professional conduct"" of registered health practitioner generally [NSW]

(1) Unsatisfactory professional conduct of a registered health practitioner includes each of the following- 

(a) Conduct significantly below reasonable standardConduct that demonstrates the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed, or care exercised, by the practitioner in the practice of the practitioner's profession is significantly below the standard reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or experience.
(b) Contravention of this Law or regulationsA contravention by the practitioner (whether by act or omission) of a provision of this Law, or the regulations under this Law or under the NSW regulations, whether or not the practitioner has been prosecuted for or convicted of an offence in respect of the contravention.

33The definition under s 139B is applicable to a reading of Complaint Two.

34The pleading as to the Complaint Three also requires a finding the doctor engaged in improper or unethical conduct relating to the practice of medicine within the meaning of s 139E:

139E Meaning of ""professional misconduct"" [NSW]

For the purposes of this Law, professional misconduct of a registered health practitioner means- 
(a) unsatisfactory professional conduct of a sufficiently serious nature to justify suspension or cancellation of the practitioner's registration; or
(b) more than one instance of unsatisfactory professional conduct that, when the instances are considered together, amount to conduct of a sufficiently serious nature to justify suspension or cancellation of the practitioner's registration.

35Mr Lynch, counsel for the doctor, contends the 1976 conduct was, as pleaded, ""plainly improper"" but he submits it cannot be characterised as unethical because the doctor was then not even a medical student and not bound by a code of ethics. The offending improper conduct should, it was contended, not be confused with the consequence of it. The offences were in 1976 and the consequences, as relied upon by the HCCC, are in 2010.

Applicable Principles
36In many authorities, especially in Re Dr Richard Wingate [2007] NSWMT 2 and in HCCC v Dr Alex Simring [2010] NSWMT 7, the Deputy Presidents of each Tribunal gave comprehensive consideration to the various authorities where the phrase ""relating to the practice of medicine"" has been considered and the application of the relevant principles to particular circumstances.

37In Wingate the practitioner had been convicted of possession of child pornography. The doctor in one complaint was alleged to have engaged in improper or unethical conduct ""relating to the practice of medicine"". The Tribunal was urged to find that the doctor was guilty of professional misconduct. The Tribunal rejected the submission finding that the conduct was neither in nor relating to the practice of medicine and so did not fall within any part of s 36 of the then Act. The matter went on appeal: HCCC v Wingate [2007] NSWCA 326, but not on the interpretation of the phrase ""relating to the practice of medicine"".

38In Simring the discussion by Basten JA on the appeal in Wingate was considered. Basten JA noted that on being convicted of the offence the practitioner became a ""prohibited person"" and was thus affected by the various laws regulating the conduct of prohibited persons. In his analysis of the effect of the various laws on Dr Wingate, Basten JA found two conclusions to flow: there is a presumption that a prohibited person ""poses a risk to the safety of children"" and that the very extensive definition of ""child-related employment"" involves the provision of personal services to children. He concluded:

[72]... Accordingly, there is presumed to be a relationship between conduct constituting an offence of a relevant kind and the provision of professional services in health, education, transport, child protection, recreation and ""other support services"".

Although not necessary to the determination of the appeal in Wingate, his Honour said:

[74]One consequence which might have followed from that understanding was that the conduct resulting in the conviction should have been treated as improper conduct ""relating to"" the practice of medicine, so as to constitute unsatisfactory professional conduct within s 36(1)(m) of the Medical Practice Act. That might have resulted in the first complaint being upheld. ...

39In Simring, the Tribunal then concluded:

75 The Tribunal is of the view that the conduct of the respondent in accessing and possessing child pornography, while done in his private life, by reason of its seriousness and reprehensible nature demonstrates an absence of qualities compatible with professional practice.76 The Tribunal further finds that the terms and effect of the legislative conditions by which the respondent is now bound place restrictions on his practice of medicine and is therefore conduct ""relating to the practice of medicine"".77 The Tribunal finds that the nature of the offence and the consequences of convictions is conduct that falls within s36(1)(m) of the Act....
79 The Tribunal finds that this conduct is unsatisfactory professional conduct of such a seriousness that it amounts to professional misconduct and finds this complaint made out.

40In both Simring and Wingate the offences, while of a private nature, were committed while each doctor was practicing medicine and complaints raised ethical issues related to a practitioner.

41Counsel for Dr A urges upon the Tribunal that, in the circumstance, there was no offence related to the practice of medicine and therefore no issue arises that requires a consideration as to whether the conduct was unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct. Rather, it is submitted the Tribunal simply deals with the effect of the conviction as recited in Complaint One.

42In Roylance v The General Medical Council [1999] UKPC 16, the court considered the point at which personal behaviour can be held to amount to professional misconduct. Lord Parker CJ observed:

""But if conduct, though reprehensible in anyone is in the case of the professional man so much more reprehensible as to be defined as disgraceful, it may, depending on the circumstances amount to conduct disgraceful of him in a professional respect in the sense that it tends to bring disgrace on the profession which he practises. It seems to me, although I do not put this forward in any sense as a definition, that the conception of conduct which is disgraceful to a man in his professional capacity is conduct disgraceful to him as reflecting on his profession ...""

43In Childs v Walton (unreported, CA 4025/90, 13 November 1990), the court considered the term ""in the practice of medicine"". Samuels JA said that the phrase contemplates:

. . . conduct by a practitioner that demonstrates his or her lack of one or more qualities indispensable to the practice of medicine.

44Spigelman CJ in NSW Bar Association v Cummins [2001] NSWCA 284 at [56] discussed the extent to which personal conduct could be said to reflect on professional conduct:

There is authority in favour of extending the terminology ""professional misconduct"" to acts not occurring directly in the course of professional practice. That is not to say that any form of personal conduct may be regarded as professional misconduct. The authorities appear to me to suggest two kinds of relationships that justify applying the terminology in this broader way. First, acts may be sufficiently closely connected with actual practice, albeit not occurring in the course of such practice. Secondly, conduct outside the course of practice may manifest the presence or absence of qualities which are incompatible with, or essential for, the conduct of practice. In this second case, the terminology of ""professional misconduct"" overlaps with and, usually it is not necessary to distinguish it from, the terminology of ""good fame and character"" or ""fit and proper person"".

45Given the effect of the above reasoning, the question becomes whether the conduct, as admitted, was closely connected with the doctor's practise of medicine and did such admitted acts reveal qualities in the doctor which qualities are incompatible with the conduct of a medical practice?

46This poses a difficult consideration given the facts in this matter. As Basten JA said, related statutory provision presumes there is a relationship between such conduct and the delivery of a professional service, in this case medical services (to children).

47However, the facts further establish the doctor's conduct occurred some 33 years ago, eight years before he enrolled in the study of medicine and some 13 years before he qualified as a medical practitioner. Through his own personal development and self-discipline in the 23 years since he graduated he has, in the practise of medicine, had no complaints brought against him. He has chosen a difficult professional path in his clinical practice and all the evidence from the Psychiatrists and community members is he is a highly skilled and competent professional with clinical knowledge and skill and great empathy. 

48The doctor in evidence revealed his sensitivity and personal commitment. While some elements in the nature of his practice, not pleaded as particulars of a complaint, have excited the interest of the Tribunal, Dr A has revealed no quality of character which would be incompatible with the practice of medicine. In the particular circumstances of this case, in the context of the unblemished practise of medicine since qualification over a period of 23 years, the Tribunal rejects that it has been established that the doctor engaged in improper conduct relating to the practise of medicine nor, therefore, professional misconduct.

49Further, even applying the test enunciated in Wingate (and as applied in Simring), while the nature of the conduct was most serious and disgraceful of him personally, but balancing his unblemished reputation post the conduct with his proven clinical skills and qualities as a most caring General Practitioner, the Tribunal finds there has not been revealed any quality of character which could attract a finding the doctor is not suitable to practise medicine.

50Complaints Two, Three and Four are, therefore, dismissed.

51However, the Complaint One is admitted. The Tribunal, in the application of its protective jurisdiction, must ensure the trust and confidence of the public and not just that minimum standards of conduct are maintained. The medical profession aspires to the highest of ethical standards.

52In that context, the doctor has sought psychiatric support. Further, he has publicly revealed his circumstances and put in place a chaperone arrangement during his clinical consultations with children. The chaperone arrangement has been endorsed by the Medical Council. The Tribunal is of the view such conditions should be continued to give assurance to the public, if there was a perception of concern or expressed concern based upon his long past conduct, of the absolute ethical manner in which the doctor conducts a skilled practice.

53Further, given the doctor revealed in his evidence some elements as to the nature of his practice, perhaps reflecting his isolation and his years of practise, the Tribunal is of the view the doctor should be given further support and an opportunity for him to be exposed to the various options available to plan and manage a general practice. Accordingly, there will be a condition for the doctor to seek further professional development. They are agreed to by both parties. The condition regarding the mentor is formalised and reflective of the doctor's already informal relationship with another practitioner in the district who clearly provides personal and professional support.

54The evidence revealed the doctor works long hours including home visits. It is difficult to put a condition on the doctor's hours of work until the doctor determines to access the valuable skills of a nurse practitioner. However, were the doctor to use such nurses, he could share the after hours/on-call duties with such a nurse. The doctor should work towards working for an eight hour day.

55There will be a condition for the doctor to continue to seek psychiatric consultation and support. This condition reflects the medical expert assessments placed before the Tribunal. The condition related to the pursuit of General Practitioner accreditation is to ensure that the doctor is reminded of the necessity for the rigorous application of professional boundaries and to ensure he is exposed to modern developments in the practise of medicine. All conditions are aimed at supporting and assisting the doctor in his clinical practice.

Orders

1.The doctor has pleaded guilty and was convicted of six offences of indecent assault on a male. Complaint One is sustained.

2.The Complaints Two and Three are dismissed.

3.Complaint Four is dismissed. The Tribunal finds the doctor is a suitable person to hold a practitioner's registration but with conditions attached to his practitioner certification (see Annexure A), the purpose of which is to provide the doctor with professional support in the conduct of his medical practice within an isolated community.

4.The respondent shall pay the complainant's costs.

		26 June 2012",2012-06-21 00:00:00,NSW Medical Tribunal
2759528,R v Boon Piau HONG and Teik Chai LEE [2012] NSWDC 267,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1I am sentencing Teik Chai Lee and Boon Piau Hong who arrived in Australia last year in order to facilitate the importation of a large amount of heroin. They are both foreign nationals and were in Australia for about a month for the purpose of arrangements to do with the importation. They have both pleaded guilty to the crime called attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. It carries a maximum of life imprisonment, and is made into a crime by s 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Both men have pleaded guilty to the crime, and when sentencing them in due course I will make an allowance for their pleas of guilty. Also I will date the sentences from the day they were arrested last year, on 12 May 2011.

2Before sentencing the two men I will say something about what they did. I will say something about each of them personally - their personal circumstances and lives - and I will refer to their lawyers' arguments. 

3Both men arrived by the same plane, travelling together on 24 April 2011 to Sydney. They came from Malaysia via Singapore. They were searched but permitted to enter the country. Significantly, on the search at the airport Mr Hong was found to have five mobile phones and a USB thumb drive with documents relating to the export of furniture from Myanmar into Malaysia. It also had images of the furniture and a packing list. Mr Lee was found to have business cards from furniture shops in Myanmar and freight companies, as well as three mobile phones. When they were ultimately arrested, it was found that the furniture which arrived in the country contained over 40 kilograms of heroin, specifically 41.5 kilograms. The level of purity was just under 60 per cent and represented nearly 25 kilograms of pure heroin, specifically 24.69 kilograms.

4A transport company called Powerhouse Logistics received an email via Mr Hong. It gave instructions for the splitting of the consignment of furniture - which had arrived by then - into two parts. One part was to be delivered to a unit in Blacktown where the two men had rented an apartment. The other was to be delivered to a second-hand furniture shop in Blacktown. Powerhouse Logistics got a further email from Mr Lee itemising the furniture to be delivered to each address. 

5Mr Hong started to make contact with an unknown person in Malaysia. He was called Ah Long. They discussed the arrival of the furniture. Mr Hong was instructed by Ah Long to supply a sample to somebody else. Mr Hong arranged for labour assistance to move the furniture, and updated Ah Long in Malaysia about the status of the transport arrangements for the furniture. 

6The men were being monitored by surveillance by the Federal Police. Somehow Mr Hong and Mr Lee came to realise that they were being observed. They made reference to it in their telephone conversations, which were also being monitored. At one stage Mr Hong told Mr Lee to change his phone card. In one of the calls to them from Ah Long in Malaysia, Mr Hong updated him about the situation and he also asked Ah Long what to do about the unit that they had rented, and to which those items of furniture containing the drugs had been arranged to be delivered. Ah Long advised them to stay away from the unit. 

7Mr Hong conveyed to Mr Lee instructions to keep alert. Ah Long gave Mr Hong advice about not panicking and Mr Hong advised Ah Long to allow them to send the consignment to Melbourne in Mr Lee's name. Mr Hong told Ah Long a little later that he had arranged to crush all the mobile phones except one. At one stage Mr Hong spoke to someone in Myanmar referred to as ""wife"", and told her that the police were following him and he needed to be careful. He asked this person if she had taken the money and she said she would go and take it at that point. Mr Hong had a conversation with Ah Long again about renting another property, that he had enough to buy five kilograms and that he would arrange for Mr Lee to catch a train go the unit to sort things out. 

8Ah Long emphasised that it was important to get everything out of the unit. Ah Long told Mr Hong to throw the phones down the toilet, to squash them and to organise more phones. The last instruction he told to Mr Lee. Mr Hong confirmed to Ah Long that he had done that, and Ah Long instructed Mr Hong to contact someone unspecified in the morning. He said he would arrange a time for them to quit, and they should do their best in the meantime. Mr Hong asked for more funds and expressed concern about his name being used and being on the Customs form. He said they would catch a bus down to Melbourne. 

9They moved into accommodation in the city. The police called on them in the early hours of 12 May 2011 and arrested them. They found, amongst other things, a set of scales and some plastic gloves and clip seal bags, and a drill. Mr Lee declined the opportunity to be interviewed. Mr Hong agreed to be interviewed. He said that he had been paid by someone to travel to Myanmar to pay for and oversee the packing of a container of furniture, to be shipped from Myanmar to Malaysia. 

10Neither man has any criminal history in Australia and they are both Malaysian citizens. 

11Turning to their personal lives, Mr Hong is a single man and Mr Lee has a wife and three daughters. Included amongst the exhibits are birth certificates for the girls who are quite young and photographs of his wife and family. 

12There is also a report from a forensic psychologist, Elle Gianvanni. She saw Mr Lee in prison. She diagnosed him with an adjustment disorder. She thought that his behaviour could be explained through the stress of duress. She based that on information provided to her by Mr Lee. He had borrowed some money within the family and was being pressured to repay it. The pressure came eventually from a man whom he knew to be a drug trafficker and he was very scared and worried but agreed to do what they said in order to settle the debt. 

13He has been married for nine years and his daughters are nine, eight and four. 

14I do not accept that he was acting under duress. The onus of proving that (on the balance of probabilities) is on Mr Lee. I do not accept it because it is too unreliable. It is hearsay evidence. It has not been sworn or affirmed and it has not been tested by cross-examination. 

15I do accept however the letter which Mr Lee wrote to the Court apologising for his criminal behaviour. He has been participating in courses within the prison system. One of his daughters has a medical condition to do with her heart as well as a cleft lip and palate. 

16Turning to Mr Hong, I have a report from Danielle Hopkins, a clinical psychologist, dated 10 April 2012. He has been in steady employment since leaving school at the age of nineteen but developed a problem with gambling. He has had difficulties controlling the problem since his early twenties. 

17Mr Hong is now 31 and Mr Lee is 35. 

18The report contains information about his personal background. Returning to his gambling, he accrued a substantial debt and was receiving pressure from his creditors to pay. The report said that he engaged in the offence as a means of repaying his debtors. He said to the psychologist that he was very sorry for his offending, knowing that it was bad for the community. 

19Ms Hopkins expressed the opinion that his gambling was directly connected to his offending. Obviously if he stopped gambling and learned some financial skills that would reduce his chances of offending. 

20Once again I do not accept that he was suffering from duress for the same reasons that I did not accept that in Mr Lee's case. However, again, I do accept his expression of remorse expressed through the psychologist. I have also read the various certificates which were the subject of exhibit 3. 

21I turn now to the arguments which the lawyers for the prosecution and each of the offenders put forward. Mr Lee was represented by Mr G C Corr of counsel. He argued that his client was the subject of duress. I have already said that I reject that submission. I do accept that the offence did not involve any actual distribution of drugs into the community, as indicating that the offence is less serious than if it had involved that.

22Mr Corr argued that the objective seriousness of his client's offence is low but his subjective factors were high in weight. I do not accept either of those submissions. They are not made out by the evidence. 

23I do accept that he has limited English which will impact or have its impact in custody. 

24Mr Corr focused much of his attention on classifying the role of his client in accordance with some classifications contained in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1. His Honour explains the classifications relevant to this case over 49-51 ([207-215]). His Honour grouped cases which he had reviewed into four categories. Mr Corr argued that his client's case fell in the lowest category, namely category 4 or, at worst, at the bottom of category 3. In my opinion they do not fall within category 4. Five out of seven of the cases in category 4 involved amounts less than 7½ kilograms. Even though Mr Lee had good antecedents and no prior convictions and pleaded guilty, they clearly do not fall in category 1 because I do not regard them as principals in the enterprise behind the importation of the drugs which they were attempting to facilitate. They both clearly reported to Ah Long in Malaysia and took instructions from him. 

25They are probably in category 2. As I said, neither is a principal but both are essential, or played essential or vital roles. I do not think they are in category 3 either. Many of the cases in category 3 involved amounts below 7 kilograms and assistance to authorities which the present cases do not involve. 

26I do agree they fall somewhere between a principal and a courier but to try to classify, in a sense, Mr Lee's behaviour and Mr Hong's behaviour into one of these groups would mean treating the Chief Judge's categories as some sort of guideline judgement which his Honour said the case was not. It also isolates one feature - namely the role of the offender - and tends to fix attention on the terms used by the Chief Judge to describe the various groups or to assist in describing the groups; terms such as ""principal"" and ""courier"".

27I find that both men were critical participants in the enterprise of importing the drugs into Australia as well as the initial stages of its intended distribution. I accept paragraph 9 of the submissions of Ms Catsanos, who appeared for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, where she argued that the conduct constituted a serious breach of s 307.2(1). Each man was a critical participant in the intended importation. 

28I do not find that Mr Hong travelled to Myanmar, as Ms Catsanos argued, for the purposes of dealing with the drugs. I do not accept the description of them playing a senior role in the syndicate in the sense of principal. I accept the relevance of the factors pointed out by Ms Catsanos in paragraph 11 of her written submissions (which I marked for identification 1) related to Mr Hong and paragraph 12 related to Mr Lee. 

29These men were entrusted with the responsibility of managing a consignment of a very large amount of heroin which had arrived in Australia. They were responsible for its collection, transit to temporary storage and passing on to somebody else in Australia, no doubt for ultimate distribution of nearly 25 kilograms of pure heroin within the Australian community. 

30It was a very large amount. I acknowledge it is far from the largest amount referred to in some of the cases. In De La Rosa some of those involved 150 kilograms but the amount was 3 or 4 times the smaller amounts referred in De La Rosa. 

31I regard Mr Hong as the more senior of the two and the one who had the more important role. He had most of the important documents in his possession on arrival. He did most of the communications with Malaysia and obtained instructions and passed them on to Mr Lee. Both men themselves were junior to Ah Long in Malaysia. He had some contact with Myanmar. 

32I do not accept the submission of Mr L Brasch of counsel, who appeared for Mr Hong, that there was no real substantial difference between the two. Acknowledging that the difference may not be substantial, nevertheless it was his client who was the senior of the two. I have tried to focus, as Mr Brasch correctly argued, on what his client did rather than to fix his role by reference to a label. I take into account the circumstances of his custody which Mr Brasch has drawn to my attention, his relative youth and the fact that he will have no visitors or support within Australia and his isolation from those closest to him.

33Returning briefly to Mr Corr's submission, I do not accept that his client was just a person at the end of the chain in the sense of doing the labour work. Two innocent labourers were hired for that purpose. 

34I have also taken into account the factors referred to by Johnson J at [72] of R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238. Public deterrence is obviously a substantially important factor in sentencing offenders such as these two men. A clean criminal record is relevant but of reduced weight in this sort of case. 

35Both men have facilitated the administration of justice in Australia by pleading guilty. I think it is appropriate to specify the allowance that I will make for that. It will be twenty five per cent. It is important that they are both publicly and adequately punished. It will be obviously very difficult for Mr Lee's family but that does not amount to an exceptional circumstance; all offenders who go to gaol cause some hardship or other within their close or extended family. 

36I will fix a non-parole period. It is important to record my opinion that the only appropriate sentence is one of full time custody. I also should note of course that I have not taken anything in the exhibits tendered by each offender into account for the other offender. 

37Given that the maximum is life imprisonment I would regard an appropriate sentence for Mr Hong as being 20 years imprisonment and for Mr Lee of being 18 years imprisonment. I propose to discount each of those sentences by 25 per cent because they have pleaded guilty. Accordingly, Mr Hong's sentence will be 15 years imprisonment and Mr Lee's sentence will be 13½ years imprisonment. I propose to fix a non-parole period for Mr Hong of 10 years imprisonment and a non-parole period for Mr Lee of 9 years imprisonment. I convict both men of the crime of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug. 

HIS HONOUR: I am now going to sentence you Mr Hong if you would stand up. 

38Mr Hong, for the crime that I have convicted you of, I sentence you to 15 years imprisonment. It will date from when you were arrested on 12 May 2011. It will therefore expire in 15 years time on 11 May 2026. I fix a non-parole period that you must be in gaol of 10 years. It will also start on 12 May 2011 and it will expire on 11 May 2021. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release is 12 May 2021. 

HIS HONOUR: Just have a seat Mr Hong. Ms Catsanos, is his release dependant on the State Parole Authority? Do they deal with Commonwealth offenders?

CATSANOS: That's correct your Honour, yes.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. .

39Mr Hong whether or not you are released on that day on parole will depend on the Parole Authority. Have a seat 

40Mr Lee, would you stand please. For the crime that I have convicted you of, I sentence you to 13 yeas and 6 months imprisonment. It started on 12 May 2011 and will expire on 11 November 2024. I fix a non-parole period of 9 years. It also started on 12 May 2011 and it will expire on 11 May 2020. The earliest date that you will be eligible for release is 12 May 2020 and that depends on the Parole Authority. 

41You are nodding, do you understand, Mr Lee? Mr Hong, do you understand your sentence? You do, thank you, have a seat. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Brasch, Mr Hudson, Ms Catsanos, first the mathematics, are they correct?

HUDSON: Yes your Honour.

BRASCH: As far as I'm concerned your Honour, yes.

CATSANOS: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Are there any factual errors that I have made or even legal ones that might be able to be corrected - I'm not sure that s 43 applies but any errors that might need to be corrected?

BRASCH: Not that I'm aware of your Honour.

HUDSON: No your Honour.

CATSANOS: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right is there anything else?

CATSANOS: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Did either of you want a word with your client, yes go ahead.

BRASCH: If we may your Honour with the interpreter?

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

2759537,R v Brett STAAS [2012] NSWDC 287,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1I am sentencing Brett Staas for a series of serious drug offences. Up until some years ago Mr Staas was leading a good and successful life. However, some change in fortunes led to him taking a dangerous drug of addiction and once he fell into its grip he embarked on a life of very serious criminal activity. That activity led to him being sentenced for the three crimes that I will now convict him of.

2The first crime is a conspiracy to manufacture a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. The amount was the indictable quantity. That is an offence against s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and carries a maximum of 15 years imprisonment. 

3The second offence is the crime of solicit to manufacture a prohibited drug. Once again the prohibited drug was methylamphetamine, but this time the crime involved a commercial quantity of that drug. That is an offence against s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carries a maximum of 20 years imprisonment.

4The third crime is supplying methylamphetamine in the indictable quantity which is an offence against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carries a maximum of 15 years imprisonment. 

5I convict Mr Staas of all three of those crimes. I should add that exhibit A - which contained the assertion that the maximum penalty for the conspiracy and the supply were 10 years each - was wrong. My associate drew that error to the attention of both the Crown Prosecutor and Senior Counsel for Mr Staas and it was agreed that the correct maximum penalties were those which I have earlier indicated.

HIS HONOUR: Just apart from my remarks on sentence here, Mr Page the particulars on the indictment specify for count 1, s 24(2) and it should read s 24(1) and my guess is I think the particulars should be - it is only a particular but I think it should be amended. My guess is that it is Mr Barr who needs to make the amendment, are you authorised to?

PAGE: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: That is what I thought. What I will do is I think I will make the amendment by hand and then I will give the indictment to you and ask Mr Barr to initial it at some stage today.

PAGE: Certainly your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And then return it to the court officer by arrangement with my associate.

PAGE: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I will just make that change now. 

6It is important for a judge to say something about the circumstances of the crimes for which the judge is sentencing an offender, as well as the personal circumstances of the offender. 

7There is a summary of the crimes contained in exhibit A. So far as the conspiracy to manufacture a prohibited drug is concerned, the conspiracy was entered into with Craig McGregor and Clarissa Burrow. Mr McGregor was the cook and Ms Burrow was essentially a runner. They were involved in an agreement for the manufacture of methylamphetamine in Mr McGregor's unit. They worked together to fulfil the common goal and were each given tasks to complete. Ms Burrow was Mr McGregor's girlfriend. She came into the agreement only about six weeks before the three of them were arrested. As I said, her task was essentially as a runner. 

8Mr Staas had a significantly more important role. His role was to source the chemicals for Mr McGregor to use in the manufacturing process. He provided half a litre of what he thought was P2P. In fact it was not. He also obtained a quantity of dry ice. He was in regular contact with Mr McGregor over some period of time. 

9The conspiracy ranged between the middle of December 2008 and the end of April 2009. Mr Staas was arrested the following day, on 30 April 2009. In discussions with Mr McGregor he sourced five litres of a chemical which again he thought was MBK but was something else, and is a scheduled precursor. 

10The supply charge was a charge which arose out of Mr Staas' relationship with a man he thought was a customer and to whom he was selling methylamphetamine. But the man was in fact an undercover operative. On a number of occasions Mr Staas agreed to supply the undercover operative with methylamphetamine. On one occasion, he provided some 77 grams of the substance on payment of $25,000. On another occasion, he was paid $18,000 for some 56 grams and on another occasion he was paid $10,000 and $9,000 for nearly 28 grams and 24 grams of methylamphetamine respectively. I add of course, which is relevant, that none of the methylamphetamine went into the community.

11The solicit to manufacture methylamphetamine charge arose out of the same relationship with the undercover operative. The undercover operative became interested in Mr Staas' source of the methylamphetamine. Mr Staas had referred to his ""cook"" and the operative asked about the process and about where the chemicals came from. Mr Staas told the operative that he supplied the ketone and that he had some 20 or 30 litres of it. He offered to supply the operative with hypophosphorus acid for between two to three thousand dollars a litre, and the ketone for some $10,000 a litre. Mr Staas said that his (Mr Staas') cook would be able to help the undercover operative by showing him how to manufacture the drugs. Mr Staas told the operative that there were various ways of making methylamphetamine and they discussed the most profitable, and the one which would lead to the greatest yield. He confirmed that he would be able to source some of the materials because the operative would not be able to get it himself. He agreed to assist him through his cook in the manufacture. Once again of course the arrangement was going nowhere, because the agreement was with the undercover operative.

12Mr Staas was represented in the sentence proceedings by Mr H K Dhanji SC and the Director of Public Prosecutions was represented by the Crown Prosecutor Mr M Barr. Mr Dhanji called his client. He is 47 years old. He spent well over a year and a half in custody after his arrest and before being bailed; in fact, he spent 1 year, 7 months, 2 weeks and 1 day in custody, and in due course I will backdate his sentence to commence on 11 November 2010 to take into account that period which he has spent in custody. He found the experience very scary, but one advantage of the period in custody was that he was able to rid himself of the drugs in his system. He effectively detoxified himself in gaol.

13He gave evidence about the serious decline in his life after the combination of his marriage to his first wife collapsing - because of her serious mental health problem - and the failure of his business. He was homeless for some time and at other times was living with his parents until they realised the extent of his drug taking, which involved methylamphetamine. He dipped into his superannuation to buy drugs. 

14The precursor P2P is used in the print industry and he was able to source that for the agreement with Mr McGregor. Mr Staas got what Mr McGregor asked for. For each of the transactions with the undercover operative selling methylamphetamine, he received $500 for each ounce he sold. 

15He has a daughter, Silvia. She is now 13. She is the daughter of Mr Staas and his first wife. She is living with Mr Staas' mother. Her own mother has remarried but is still not sufficiently stable to be able to look after Silvia fulltime. Mr Staas gave evidence about his mother's medical condition, which I will come to refer to further. Mr Staas has a sister living in Avalon who has two adult children, and works six days a week in real estate. Silvia is in Year 7 at school. He expressed his shame and remorse at what he had done and said that it was inexcusable. 

16Mrs Janice Staas gave evidence. She was married to Mr Staas' father but her husband died in the last few years. She gave evidence about Mr Staas staying with her and her husband as he was deteriorating. At one stage, she took him to the Manly Crisis Centre and I have records indicating that attendance. Mr Staas had become very depressed. He was also taking drugs at the same time, which his mother had a suspicion about. She has noticed his change over the last 12 months, and the return of his personality. He was in fact given bail because his father was dying, and he reconciled with his father before his father died. He has now done, as Mrs Staas said, all things just right and is back to work admitting his wrong. She was 98 per cent sure that her son would be okay. She confirmed that she has a daughter as well, but pointed out that the daughter has two grandchildren as well as her two adult children. 

17Mr Staas comes from a family which has conducted for many years a printing business. His father and his uncle, Ian Staas, were partners in the business. Mr Dhanji SC called Mr Ian Staas to give evidence. He is still working in the business which supports six employees. Mr Staas, the offender, is employed in the business as the manager for about three days a week. Mr Ian Staas knows about his nephew's drug addiction and problems, and trusts him now because he has seen changes in his nephew's condition. He trusts in the rehabilitation process which his nephew has been undergoing. Mr Ian Staas would like to retire and hand over the business to the offender, Mr Staas. If need be he can carry on.

18Mr Dhanji SC tendered as exhibit 1 a psychologist's report about Mr Staas the offender, as well as clinical notes from his attendance at the Crisis Centre in 2006, and a medical report from his mother's GP, and some references and certificates. His mother's GP confirmed that Mrs Staas suffers from several chronic conditions, which she listed. The references all indicate that Mr Staas is now well regard both personally and in business. He has undertaken some courses whilst in custody.

19Mr Dhanji SC, when the matter was listed for sentence yesterday, sought leave to re open his client's case and to tender fresh evidence. The evidence concerns Mr Staas' mother, Mrs Staas, who collapsed over the weekend and was admitted to hospital for the day. She was reviewed in there. Her medication was adjusted and she was referred back to her GP, who saw her again last Monday when she was still dizzy, off-balance and requiring assistance to work. She is of course affected by the stress of Mr Staas' court case but the exhibit tendered by Mr Staas, which I have marked 2, also included a report from two psychologists about Silvia Staas. 

20The report referred to significant sources of adversity which young Silvia Staas has had to encounter in her short life. Her parents became separated and divorced, which of course these days is not unusual. However her mother had suffered from bipolar disorder and a schizoid affective disorder, which impacted on her ability to be Silvia's fulltime parent. She went into formal guardianship with her grandparents, Mrs and Mrs Staas, however the psychologist records that Mr Staas ""died whilst caring for Silvia"" in late 2010. The psychologists went on to say that since Mr Staas senior's death ""Janet noted that Silvia appeared emotionally numb and had withdrawn from others."" The psychologists observe that these circumstances have ""impacted significantly on the family's levels of stress, and Janice's ability to support Silvia."" They express the opinion that given Silvia's history of grief and loss, and current mental health concerns, it was ""imperative that her father, Brett, continues to play the role of her father in her life."" They believe that imprisonment would further punish Silvia, ""with the potential of this decision resulting her in becoming a ward of the State."" They thought that Silvia continued to be ""at risk of serious mental health difficulties, given her strong family history of mental illness, coping with her grandmother's health concerns, her mother's mental health concerns and adjusting to the loss of her grandfather."" I will return to what Mr Dhanji SC and Mr Barr had to say specifically about that issue shortly. 

21In their general submissions I was greatly assisted by written submissions prepared by Mr Dhanji SC, which I marked for identification 2. He pointed out that the drug supply amounted in all to about 186 grams of methylamphetamine, and that he sought to supply the drugs in order to fund his habit. That may well be the case, but he also sourced the drugs in order to generate income to support his family. It is the case, and I accept, that no drugs were distributed into the community as a result of his contact with the undercover operative. 

22Mr Dhanji SC said that Mr Staas' role in soliciting the undercover operative to manufacture methylamphetamine was an example of someone keen to talk big perhaps for ulterior motives. That may well be the case, but it should be seen in the context that his efforts to manufacture methylamphetamine in agreement with Craig McGregor were not producing results and so it seems Mr Staas was prepared to extend his manufacturing supply activities on a second front. Although the chemicals he was sourcing and supplying were of no use in manufacturing, he did source what he thought was needed and used his contacts to do that. He had been diagnosed with a depression and anxiety disorder as a result of his personal and professional life falling apart and I do accept that his judgment was probably affected by that.

23I accept that he has no significant record of prior convictions. His prior convictions - although related to the possession of drugs - occurred 20 or 30 years ago and I regard their weight as negligible. I do find that his prospects of rehabilitation are good and that he is unlikely to re-offend. He was well regarded in the community.

24I accept that the drug supply involved a series of criminal acts. 

25I do not agree with Mr Dhanji SC that Mr Staas and Ms Burrow's roles were similar. Ms Burrow was in the conspiracy for a shorter time and her role was limited to that of a runner. Mr Staas' role was one of the primary participants and he was an original participant in the agreement with Mr McGregor and played a more important role in sourcing what he thought were the necessary precursors. 

26I overlooked making reference in these remarks to the helpful reports from the clinical psychologist who examined Mr Staas. That was the experienced forensic psychologist Anita Duffy whose report was contained in exhibit 1. She provided a detailed history of Mr Staas' life, including his failed marriage to his first wife who was severely affected by a mental health disorder and his deterioration into drug use and the failure of his business. He has resumed his work in the family business and is happily married to his second wife and she accepts his assertion that he has no desire to use drugs again. He is resilient now. She was of the opinion that going to gaol would place his progress in jeopardy. She thought his judgment was affected at the time by his depression and anxiety. 

27The drug supplies which Mr Staas made with the undercover operative were relatively large amounts and involved a relatively large amount of money. I regard general deterrence as a very important factor to take into account. 

28So far as specific deterrence is concerned it is obviously important but it is a factor which I think has already had its influence on Mr Staas. I think it is unlikely that he will engage in this activity again.

29Both counsel drew my attention to the importance of parity in sentencing. When I sentenced Mr McGregor I imposed a sentence of 4 years and 9 months for the conspiracy to manufacture a drug - being the same conspiracy that Mr Staas was in - and I ordered a non-parole period of 3 years. For Ms Burrow there was one very significant mitigating factor. I imposed a sentence for her participation in the same conspiracy of 2 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months. I regard Mr Staas' role in the conspiracy as about the same as Mr McGregor's and Ms Burrow's role as less significant than both of them. 

30Mr Dhanji SC - when he made his submissions last Friday 22 June - argued that Mr Staas' rehabilitation, future prospects and his return to the family business may be such that I might see it as an appropriate case to exercise extraordinary leniency and to fix a non-parole period which would be about the same as the amount of time he has already spent in custody. When I came onto the bench to sentence Mr Staas yesterday I had decided that I would not take that course and that his non-parole period would be longer than that. I then heard the additional evidence about Mrs Janice Staas and about Mr Staas' daughter Silvia and heard further submissions from Mr Barr and Mr Dhanji SC. Mr Dhanji argued that the circumstances concerning his daughter and Mrs Janice Staas' precarious situation were such that it tipped the considerations of hardship to people other than the offender over the line from being a general factor to take into account amongst the personal considerations relevant to an offender into the very exceptional circumstance where I might take it into account as a specific mitigating factor in either reducing the non-parole period to be no greater than the period he has already spent in custody or at least significantly reducing what might otherwise be the non-parole period. 

31I have given this matter earnest consideration over the last 24 hours. I am concerned about what the psychologists say about the precarious position which Silvia finds herself in. There has been a combination of adverse factors in her life identified by the psychologists which have resulted in her being in a very difficult situation at a very young age. 

32I also take into account the health of Mrs Staas and her uncertain ability to be available to continue to look after Silvia. 

33I have decided that that will have an impact on the non-parole period which I will fix. I do not propose to reduce it to a period which is no more than the amount of time that Mr Staas has served in custody. I think that that would be result in a sentence which was too lenient and which would be inadequate to reflect the extent of the criminal behaviour which he was engaged in. I propose in due course to sentence him to a period of imprisonment with a non-parole period which will see his release in January next year. I also propose to impose an aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

34I should add that I heard submissions about the pleas of guilty which Mr Staas had entered. I accept that he should receive a full discount for his pleas to the conspiracy to manufacture the indictable quantity of methylamphetamine and his supply of methylamphetamine. I have determined that the discount for his plea to the solicit to manufacture should be 15 per cent. 

35The sentence which I would have imposed for his conspiracy to manufacture an indictable quantity (the conspiracy being with Mr McGregor and Ms Burrow) was 5 years imprisonment. Because of his plea of guilty and the contribution which that makes to the administration of justice I propose to discount that by 25 per cent so that the sentence will be 3 years and 9 months imprisonment. 

36In respect of the supplying of drugs to the undercover operative, I regard an appropriate sentence is one of 5 years imprisonment. For the same reason I will discount that by 25 per cent and the sentence that I would have imposed would have been 3 years and 9 months. I would have commenced the second sentence 1 year after the first sentence. The first sentence would have commenced on 11 November 2010 having taken into account Mr Staas's period in custody. The second sentence would have commenced on 11 November 2011, 1 year later. 

37The sentence I would have imposed for the solicit to manufacture would have been 4 years imprisonment. I would have discounted that by 15 per cent and imposed a sentence of 3 years and 4 months imprisonment and I would have directed that to commence 6 months later on 11 May 2012. 

38The total period of the sentence would have been 4 years and 10 months from 11 November 2010 to 10 September 2015. 

39The special circumstances which I take into account in adjusting the ratio between the non-parole period and the full sentence include the hardship to Silvia but also the need for Mr Staas to continue in his efforts of rehabilitation. If I had imposed the standard non-parole period for a sentence of 4 years and 10 months it would be a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months. If I had reduced that to 50 per cent it would have been 2 years and 5 months. I propose to reduce the non-parole period by a factor which will result in it being 45 per cent of the head sentence, namely, a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months.

HIS HONOUR: I will now sentence you, Mr Staas, if you would stand up. 

40Mr Staas, I fix a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months to commence on 11 November 2010 and to expire on 10 January 2013. There will be an additional period of 2 years and 8 months to commence on 11 January 2013 and to expire on 10 September 2015. Your full sentence is 4 years and 10 months commencing 11 November 2010 and expiring 10 September 2015. Your non-parole period commenced on 11 November 2010 and will expire 2 years and 2 months later on 10 January 2013. You are eligible for release on parole on 10 January 2013 that will be the first date upon which it seems to me that you are eligible to be released. Your release will depend upon the Parole Authority. Have a seat, Mr Staas.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Page, Mr Mallinson, the figures - I think I have them correct. Would you both please check them? Mr Page, Mr Mallinson, do it carefully there's no rush. I will provide you with a copy of the order actually, it might help.

MALLINSON: That's correct, your Honour.

PAGE: That's correct, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you both. 

41Mr Staas, for the reasons that I have just given I have given you the sentence which I have just announced. You must go into custody now. You will be eligible for release in January, 10 January next year that is significantly reduced to what it would be normally. Normally a standard non-parole period - not a ""standard"" one but the legislation provides for it being 75 per cent of the full sentence so if that formula was applied your non-parole period would be 3 years and 7 months. Even if I halve that it would be 2 years and 5 months. I have fixed it so that it expires just into next year: 2 years and 2 months represents 45 per cent of the head sentence which is a significant reduction. I have taken into account, you have heard me, particularly your daughter's situation, your mother's precarious health and your daughter's precarious psychological situation. I cannot fix it any shorter than that. I would regard it as inappropriate and insufficient or an inadequate punishment for the crimes that you have committed. Your release on parole depends on the Parole Authority, do you understand? All right. 

HIS HONOUR: Did you want a word with your client at all, the Corrective Services are here, did you want a word with your client?

MALLINSON: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Have a quick word now before he is taken down. Mr Hughes, Mr Walsh. Thanks Mr Page.

PAGE: There's just two small matters of housekeeping. I asked for a destruction order in relation to the drugs and drug exhibits and there's still the issue of the confiscation application.

HIS HONOUR: All right.

PAGE: I'll wait until my friend--

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Mr Mallinson, finish your conversation. There's just something else which has come up, just finish at this stage there's just something which has been mentioned so he's not going down right now but it will be in a minute or so. 

MATTER INTERPOSED

HIS HONOUR: Mr Page, you were mentioning two other things. Just have a seat again, Mr Staas, Mr Page has just raised something. What was the section, do you know the section under which I destroy?

PAGE: I believe it's s 39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.

42Good, under s 39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act I direct that the drugs be destroyed. 

HIS HONOUR: Now, there is a confiscation order. 

PAGE: There's a confiscation order contested application. A date for that still needs to be fixed. I spoke to my friend, 13 July is suitable to myself and defence.

HIS HONOUR: 13 July I will be out of the country or flying out of the country. I am available today, depending on the jury I might be available tomorrow and then I'm back in October. 

MALLINSON: Regrettably, your Honour, Mr Nield who is briefed for Mr Staas isn't back in the country until 9 July I'm not too sure how that will suit your Honour's diary, it may be we have to have the matter listed when your Honour returns.

HIS HONOUR: What's the subject of the dispute?

PAGE: At this stage, your Honour, I don't believe any of it is consented to, there are two claims by the Crown. One is in relation to essentially the buy one of the undercover operative that money was never recovered I believe that totals $62,000. There's also a diamond ring which was seized during a search warrant. That's the item - there's a contested ownership claim of it.

HIS HONOUR: All right, it sounds as though it could go over to October without any harm so to speak.

PAGE: I believe so, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: I've got another matter which is listed for Friday 19 October.

PAGE: That's suitable, your Honour, to the Crown.

MALLINSON: That will be suitable to the defence, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I list the confiscation matter in Brett Staas's case on Friday 19 October 2012 at 10am. What's the evidence - have you got an application there, Mr Page?

PAGE: One has been filed with the registry.

HIS HONOUR: We might pick it up. Is there an affidavit in support?

PAGE: I believe I was told by our confiscation guru that one wasn't required there is the drug proceeds order on the short minutes of order and the--

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, the what?

PAGE: The Short Minutes of Order, the drug proceeds order, I was told an affidavit wasn't required, I can file one if your Honour--

HIS HONOUR: I don't know because I don't know what the application is about. Why don't I list it for mention at 2 o'clock today just to sort out - we'll see if we can find the application and I just want to sort out what to keep in my chambers and what I do need and what I don't need, what I can send back and what I don't need to send back.

PAGE: I believe your Honour still retain the exhibits from the McGregor trial.

HIS HONOUR: I do.

PAGE: One of them was returned but if there are any further I'm happy to take custody of them.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks, we'll have a look at that. All right, I'll list it for mention at 2 o'clock. Mr Staas, we will bring you back up at 2 o'clock. We will just sort out the confiscation matter which I will not hear until the middle of October but we will just see what is in it at 2 o'clock. Mr Staas can be taken down, thank you, gentlemen.

MATTER INTERPOSED

HIS HONOUR: Just whilst I think of it Mr Mallinson there's a report by Ms Anita Duffy, as I referred to in the remarks on sentence, about your client. The prison authorities indicate that they are assisted by reports such as that in their classification of a prisoner and my associate often sends them to the Corrective Services Department but I don't do that without the permission of the offender and it's something you might like to get instructions about. It does assist the Corrective Services in classification. Some prisoners don't want that sort of material being sent to the Corrective Services Department for their own reasons. So do you want to get some instructions on that? Thanks. 

MALLINSON: Your Honour, I've received instructions. Mr Staas is happy with that course.

HIS HONOUR: He's happy with that course, thank you. My associate will send a copy of that this afternoon by email or fax. The application I have listed for I think 19 October, we've got the application and the draft orders and as you say, Mr Page, it's about the money used to purchase the drugs and also a ring by the looks of it. There's no affidavits.

PAGE: No, your Honour, I received some instructions in relation to that and I was told - we intend to proceed by way of tendering a statement in those circumstances an affidavit is not required. 

HIS HONOUR: All right.

PAGE: I can advise the statement we intend to rely upon it's from the officer-in-charge it has been served on the defence.

HIS HONOUR: Been served, all right.

PAGE: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Mallinson, do you know whether you will be -I'm just trying to work out how much time to allocate it that's all - whether you will be calling evidence or not or you don't know the answer to that question?

MALLINSON: Your Honour, I've spoken to Mr ..(not transcribable).. of senior counsel in the break, he's indicated that 19 October isn't suitable to his diary.

HIS HONOUR: Is not?

MALLINSON: Is not because as I understand the Crown needs the matter to be listed on a Friday, the 5th and the 12th are available, if that's available to your Honour .

HIS HONOUR: The 5th is not - no, neither of those is I'm interstate. I mean, I picked that Friday because the following two weeks I'm in Bourke.

MALLINSON: Your Honour, the 19th is available for Mr Nield of junior counsel who will also be able to appear for Mr Staas.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I think that's the best I can do I'm afraid. 

MALLINSON: In terms of the statement we've received that from the Crown but at this stage, your Honour, I don't have instructions or any guidance from counsel about whether or not we will be leading evidence. It's the intention of Mr Staas to have this matter settled with the Crown sometime before 19 October.

HIS HONOUR: Want to try and settle it?

MALLINSON: That's correct, your Honour.

PAGE: The only complicating aspect to that, your Honour, is that the - subject to a claim by a third party, someone who is in custody so it's going to complicate things as far as settling that aspect of the confiscation application. I intend on inviting that person to provide a statement to us in relation to their involvement which I will serve on defence and it could be arising out of that statement that the matter is able to be resolved out of court as it were.

HIS HONOUR: All right. I direct that my associate be notified by Friday 12 October 2012 of whether the matter has been settled at that stage or not. If not, I direct the Crown to indicate how many witnesses, if any, it proposes to call and what documents it proposes to tender and I direct the defence to indicate how many witnesses it proposes to call and what documents it proposes to tender. How does that sound?

PAGE: If the court pleases.

HIS HONOUR: My associate will provide each of you with her card so that that direction can be complied with.

PAGE: Thank you, your Honour. Might I also hand up the indictment amended by the Crown Prosecutor?

HIS HONOUR: Thanks, Mr Page. That can go on the court file. Mr Page, Mr Mallinson you are excused and Mr Staas can be taken down.

ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 19 OCTOBER 2012

2759556,R v Jarryd HYDE aka Jarryd RAYWARD [2012] NSWDC 93,"SENTENCE Judgment

Introduction
1Mr John Ferella died on 2 December 2010. When he left his home that day for a job interview, he was not to know that he would miss his son's wedding and loose forever, his joy in being a loving husband, father and grandfather. Mr Ferella died through no fault of his own. All his thoughts, hopes and dreams ended instantly in a collision that occurred solely because of the way Jarryd Hyde drove. 

2Immediately before the collision, Mr Hyde (charged as Jarryd Rayward), the offender now before the court, drove, at speed, the wrong way, up the entrance ramp to the Hume Highway at Narellan. The offender's driving in the lead up to Mr Feralla's death was truly dangerous. He drove to escape a lawful and careful police pursuit. He was driving a stolen car. He was disqualified from driving. He had never held a driving licence. He was serving an incomplete sentence for other offences. He had been released to parole on 1 October 2010. In the collision his two passengers were injured. Both will be referred to by their initials, MS and JK, as they are children. 

3I must now sentence the offender for the crimes he committed. My sentences must ensure that adequate punishment is imposed. They must make the offender accountable for his actions; actions which showed a gross abandonment of personal responsibility. There was and could be no excuse for his behaviour. Here to his credit the offender offered none. The sentences must recognise the harm done to Mr Ferella, MS and JK and the impact Mr Ferella's death had on his family and the community. The sentences must operate to denounce the conduct of this offender. They should, so far as is possible, operate to deter others. Sentences must, where possible, act as a deterrent to the offender himself. Here a lengthy goal term may serve that purpose. 

4Courts have a responsibility to do what they can to ensure human life is respected and preserved and to punish those who unlawfully take it. Sentences must also recognise the community interest in encouraging the rehabilitation of young people such as the offender. After he has served the minimum period that the law deems necessary it is in everyone's interests that he be able to re-integrate into the community. 

5There are internal tensions between the various purposes of sentencing. Any perceived leniency, because of the need to recognise those competing community interests, should not be interpreted as understating the seriousness of the offences committed, in particular that which resulted in the death of Mr Ferella. No punishment could possibly do justice to the finality of what was done to Mr Ferella or compensate his family for their loss. That loss was set out in the emotional and heartfelt expressions of grief in the victim impact statements read at Campbelltown Court on 11 May 2012: Exhibit A tabs 9 to 12.

Facts
6There are agreed facts: Exhibit A tab 5. Those facts were supplemented by my viewing in court of the recordings taken at the scene from two police cars: Exhibits C & D. 

7The first offence in the sequence I must consider was the breaking into a home in Bexley on 24 November 2010. A family home was ransacked and valuables worth about $14,000 taken. The offender left his fingerprints at the scene. 

8Next, there was a break and enter at a Wattle Grove home on the night of 1 December 2010. Keys to a Holden Commodore BHT 23D were stolen and then used to take the car that had been parked at the front of the premises. The offender subsequently obtained the keys and the car. He then picked up MS, aged 17, and JK, aged 13. Their intent was obvious by what occurred next. That morning at Camden Park three other family homes were broken into, ransacked and property taken. 

9Police, alerted by information from the public that something suspicious was occurring, went to the Camden Park area around midday. They saw BHT 23D, near the homes that had been entered. Soon after the car, driven by the offender, moved towards them. The police car's lights and siren were activated. An attempt was made to block BHT 23D. The offender got round the blockage by driving onto the footpath at speed. Another police car on its way to the scene was forced to swerve off the road to avoid a collision. A short pursuit took place, but the police quickly terminated it in the interest of public safety. Soon after other police travelling in Remembrance Drive, near Picton, saw BHT 23D travelling towards them at a speed well in excess of the 80km per hour limit for that road. They did not pursue the vehicle as it was going too fast. 

10Not long afterwards a number of members of the public travelling on the Hume Highway reported BHT 23D was heading north toward Campbelltown travelling well in excess of the 110km/hr limit. One report indicated BHT 23D was apparently overtaking cars ""as if they were standing still"". At about 1pm Highway Patrol commenced the pursuit shown on Exhibit C. Other Highway Patrol officers deployed the road spikes about 650m short of the Narellan Road overpass and exit and access ramps. This is shown on Exhibit D. 

11To avoid the spikes the offender drove BHD 23D across the grassed median centre separating both the south and northbound lanes of the Hume Highway. He then drove north into the southbound lanes of the highway, against the flow of traffic, narrowly avoiding several collisions. The offender drove for approximately 600 metres on the incorrect side of the roadway at well over 110km/ph before exiting the highway the incorrect way up the Narellan Road access ramp. At this time the deceased, John Ferella, was driving his black Holden Commodore sedan in a southerly direction on the access ramp. He was the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle. The inevitable collision occurred about 200 metres within the ramp. Its impact forced back Mr Ferella's vehicle, causing it to roll on its roof. The collision killed John Ferella. His injuries were extensive. 

12As a result of the collision, the young person, MS, who was sitting in the rear passenger seat behind the driver, suffered:
(a)A break to the right collar bone,
(b)Fractures to the left 2nd - 6th ribs
(c)Fracture to the chest bone,
(d)A perforation to the small bowel requiring surgery.

13He spent 4 days in the intensive care unit after the bowel operation.

14The young person, JK, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, suffered: 
(a)Tenderness to the neck, collarbone and lower back, 
(b)Superficial abrasions,
(c)An acute compression fracture of the second lumbar vertebra - the fracture was stable and required no surgical treatment.

15 The offender was not seriously injured. He ran. He did not stop to assist Mr Ferella or his two young and injured friends. He was arrested soon after, still with stolen jewellery in his pockets. Both injured passengers were later interviewed and told police they had asked the offender to stop as they were scared. 

The Offender
16On 1 October 2010 the offender was released to parole. He had served just over 5 months of a 12 month sentence imposed at Campbelltown Local Court. Although only 22 (DOB 29/11/1988) it was not his first time in custody. He first came before the Children's Court in January 2003 for stealing a car and driving it in a manner dangerous to the public. Aged 15, he received a short sentence to a Juvenile Justice institution. Despite being released to probation he was soon back in custody, again for offences involving a stolen motor vehicle. Within weeks of his release he was again arrested and control orders imposed for taking a motor vehicle and driving it in a reckless or dangerous manner. That pattern has not been broken. 

17At no time since 2003 has the offender spent more than 6 months at a time in the community. He has numerous offences for dishonesty but more importantly in the past he has stolen or has been carried in stolen cars and driven those cars in a dangerous manner. The failure to break that pattern reached its climax on 2 December 2010. The tragic consequence of the crimes committed that day will resonate in the community for years to come.

18As I have said earlier that these offences occurred while on parole aggravates the sentences, however the offender is not to be sentenced for his past. His past offending is however relevant to my attempt to understand why these offences occurred. 

19The offender gave evidence. I found him to be candid and truthful. He confirmed both the positive and negative aspects of the background and history given to his Psychologist, Ms Nasr, and set out in his former partner Ms Luckwell's letter: Exhibits 1 and 2. He said he accepted full responsibility for each of his actions. He acknowledged how hard he will have to work while in custody to address his offending behaviour and that he will need help to do so. He expressed some insight, regret and remorse but I doubt he has the emotional or other resources as yet to fully comprehend the enormity of his crimes and their consequences. 

20I found Ms Nasr's report very helpful. It indicates the pattern of offending and custody starting well before the offender had a chance to make rational and mature decisions. Unsurprisingly, she notes his defiance, impulsivity and hostility and difficulty with authority. His parents tried, but did not have the resources, to keep him within proper boundaries. His elder brother died following a police pursuit. The death has had an adverse and negative impact on him. He said in evidence he also witnessed the serious injuries caused another brother in yet another but more recent motor vehicle accident.

21He has had limited schooling exacerbated by a stuttering problem. Ms Nasr notes a low (borderline) level of intellectual functioning. These problems and deficits did not leave him well equipped to deal with adult life. Similarly, early uptake of drugs and alcohol and mixing with anti-social peers in and out of juvenile detention meant that he entered adulthood with none of the advantages of what may be termed a normal upbringing. 

22Although himself a parent, he has, because of his time in custody, had little opportunity to assume any responsibility for his daughter, now 5 years old. It appears crime and drug use were more important to him than anything else. While in many respects some of his problems, especially his time in custody, stem from his own criminal actions, his decisions, including those which led to the commission of these offences, were those of an immature child and an irresponsible and immature young adult. His gross immaturity it appears stems, in part at least, from the many disadvantages he suffered as a child. 

23Ms Nasr's diagnosis of conduct disorder means he has, even now, a limited capacity to recognise the consequences of his actions or to cope outside of custody with proper responsibilities and boundaries of an adult citizen. I do not underestimate the significance of his dysfunctional childhood to these conclusions. It meant that he had, and still now has, fewer emotional resources to guide him than most people: see R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2 at [69]. 

24It is clear from Ms Nasr's report that he has become institutionalised. As she notes at [45]: 
""His functioning may in part be explained by early developmental vulnerabilities associated with learning and behavioural difficulties, in addition to the problems associated with impulsivity, disinhibition and impoverished complex reasoning, which was probably exacerbated by his substance abuse history and anti-social peer association. It seems these risk factors have shaped his developmental trajectory, where almost his entire maturation has occurred within the custodial environment, such that Mr Hyde has become institutionalised to such an extent that he is lacking many of the basic coping and independent living skills that is required for independent and stable living."" 

25The offender's prognosis is poor. If he is to adapt to normal community life on release he will, as Ms Nasr concludes, ""require extensive co-ordinated supervision and support to have a chance of stable living"". She recommends that:
(1)He progress through a structured pre-release program, which allows him experience in the community in a staged and supported way. 
(2)He be released into a community offender support program or other halfway house or long term rehabilitation facility. 
(3)He receive considerable assistance with living skills and employment. 
(4)He needs structured support in the community from Community Offender Services. 
(5)He needs psychological treatment and supportive counselling.
His background is a mitigating factor, but it does not absolve him from responsibility for what he did, nor could it excuse the tragic and lasting consequences of his crimes. 

26Mr Smith, for the offender, accepted this. In fair and helpful submissions he drew my attention to many of the matters I have set out in these remarks. 

The Offences
27There are 3 offences for sentence: 
(1)Manslaughter: s18(1)(b): 24 Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment.
(2)Aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm (escape pursuit by police officer): s 52A(4) Crimes Act - maximum penalty 11 years imprisonment.
(3)Drive furiously occasioning actual bodily harm s 53 Crimes Act - maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment.

28In relation to the manslaughter offence I am asked to take into account the four (4) Break, Enter and Steal matters and an offence of receiving the stolen car: respectively, sections 112(1)(a) and s 188(1) Crimes Act. In relation to the aggravated dangerous driving matter I am asked to take into account an offence of failing to stop and assist after vehicle impact causing death and police pursuit: ss 52AB(1) and s 51B(1) Crimes Act. There is also an offence on a s 166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 certificate of driving while disqualified, s 25A(1)(a) Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998.

29The maximum penalties for the offences set by Parliament indicate the seriousness with which the community view such offences. On any assessment, each offence because of its consequences, and the course of driving that preceded it, must fall towards the high end of the range of objective gravity for offences of their type. 

30The Court of Criminal Appeal in Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, formulated sentencing guidelines for serious driving offences whose maximum penalties range from 10 to 14 years such as the second charge here. An offence of manslaughter, with its much higher maximum generally involves, as here, crimes of greater culpability, given the premium placed on human life. 

31I have regard to the maximum penalties and the guideline. Clearly the individual sentences for the first and second charges must exceed those in guideline, given the nature of the charges and the aggravating features that apply to each. 

32The Crown and Defence, in submissions, drew my attention to a number of other cases, including R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102, Bombardieri v R [2010] NSWCCA 161, R v Cameron [2005] NSWCCA 359 and Duncan v R [2012] NSWCCA 78. 

33Mr Smith noted that many of the authorities referred to involved multiple deaths. He drew my attention to the comment by Buddin J in Bombardieri at [55] in which His Honour's review of sentences for motor vehicle manslaughter and aggravated s 52A Crimes Act sentences, led him to accept a submission that the sentence under review, 10 years with a 6 ½ year non parole period for a single death ""would be more appropriate for an offence falling into the motor/manslaughter category of offence"". With respect, I do not believe there is a settled range of sentences for motor/manslaughter matters. Nor do I believe ""motor/manslaughter"" is a universally accepted category of offence. Every manslaughter offence's facts must be viewed independently as each unlawful death has its own unique features. 

34I must have regard to what is said in other similar matters and authoritative cases such as those noted above: see R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177, cited with approval by Beazley JA in Bombardieri at [16]. I must endeavour to apply sentencing principles in a consistent manner taking account of the objectives of sentencing but each sentence, consistent with principle, must reflect the individual offence and the individual offender: see Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45. 

35A sentence must attempt to synthesise many competing features. Here they include the complexity of the offender's background and behaviour and the consequences of his crimes. Courts must attempt to translate all such matters into units of punishment: see Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; (2003) 212 CLR 629 at [24]. When all relevant matters are considered the sentence imposed must be proportionate to the gravity of the crime and not reduced because of unjustified leniency or extended simply to protect the community from the offender.

36The manslaughter offence was an offence of great seriousness because:
(1)Of the wholly unnecessary and avoidable death of Mr Ferella. The terrible finality of what he did to Mr Ferella cannot be undone by anything the offender does during the rest of his life nor by any punishment that this court inflicts. 
(2)The offender's actions exposed many others to an appreciable and grave risk of serious harm. This included his passengers, one of whom was under 16.
(3)The offence occurred to escape pursuit and soon after his avoiding a police road block. 
(4)The course of driving prior to the collision, in particular when he left the highway and moved across the median strip into the southbound lane, showed a complete lack of moral responsibility.
(5)The offence was preceded by many flagrant breaches of the road rules. 
(6)The offender's driving was unlawful on a number of other levels. The car was stolen. He was disqualified from driving. He had never held a licence. His actions were in breach of his parole obligations. 

37There are no objective matters that could operate to excuse what the offender did. 

38So far as the second charge is concerned, MS's injuries were so serious that he spent four days in an intensive care unit. In Whyte [236] the Chief Justice noted that a two year sentence was generally appropriate for a case where moral culpability was high. . His Honour set out a number of factors that could be used gauge moral culpability. Here not only does the offender's crime fall into the aggravated category referred to at [236] but it also encompasses many of the factors that were, individually, regarded as indicating a high degree of moral culpability. 

39The dangerous driving preceding the incident showed, as it did with the manslaughter offence, an abandonment of personal responsibility and gross moral culpability. While many of the elements of this offence and matters in aggravation overlap with the first charge there must be some measure of independent punishment specifically to recognise the significance of the injury and harm done to MS. While MS, along with JK, chose to join the offender in the property crimes committed the agreed facts record their understandable terror at the dangerousness of the offender's driving. 

40The third offence was less serious as the injuries to the young person JK were of a more transient nature. It was however a serious example of that type of offence. Because of the risk of double counting matters of aggravation and application of the totality principle a considerable degree of concurrence with the sentence for the second count is required. 

41As the offender was disqualified from driving at the time he must be dealt with for that offence. If it had been dealt with in the Local Court he would, because of his record, have received a custodial sentence of some length. There must be some discrete punishment for this offence. 

Form 1 Matters.
42While the court must sentence for the principal offence only, matters on a Form 1 can be taken into account to increase the penalty that would otherwise be imposed. In the guideline judgment on this topic Attorney General's Application under s37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518, the Chief Judge said, at [42], a court could do so by giving greater weight to the need for personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to exact retribution. The Chief Justice noted limitations on any increase included the maximum penalty for the offence and the proper application of the principal of totality. 

43Where a sentence is increased because of Form 1 matters, a Judge does simply not replicate the sentence that would have been imposed had the matters been charged separately: see Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254 at [19]. 

44Had the Form 1 matters for the first offence been dealt with separately they would have resulted in significant custodial penalties, although partial concurrency would have been required. The effect of using the Form 1 gives the offences so included significantly lower salience in the sentencing process: Attorney General's Application No 1 of 2002 at [66].

45That said, the Form 1 matters must operate to increase the sentence I impose on the first charge. The car used in the offences had been stolen and four families had their homes ransacked. A large quantity of property was stolen. Such crimes involve not just the taking of insured property that can be replaced but also other items of personal and sentimental value, which will be lost forever. Further, not everyone and everything is insured. The impact of a break, enter and steal offence on its individual victims must be recognised. Such offences also led to feelings of insecurity and break down community trust and cohesion. Significant sums must be spent on prevention and insurance. 

46So far as the Form 1 for the second offence is concerned, the charges have a slightly different flavour. His failure to stop and assist the injured is yet another example of his criminal actions and moral culpability that day. While the second police pursuit matter relates to a separate incident of dangerous driving, it is a matter that immediately preceded the offences for which he is now being sentenced. As these events aggravated the overall criminality of the incident it is harder to distinguish them from matters that have already been taken into account. Were I to significantly increase the sentence as a result of this Form 1 it would involve double counting. 

On Parole
47At 2 December 2010 the offender had 4 ½ months of his incomplete sentence still to serve. His parole was breached because of the new charges: Exhibit 3. During his short time on parole his response to supervision was considered to be ""borderline"". He had not taken advantage of the opportunities early release gave him.

48His abuse of the privilege of conditional liberty offered him aggravates the sentences I must impose to an extent that were I, in structuring the sentence, to allow a discrete period solely for the breach, there would be double counting: see R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 at [35] and [79].

Concurrence, Accumulation and Totality
49In structuring the sentences I must recognise:
(1)There must be separate and discrete sentences and a measure of independent punishment particularly for the first two offences. 
(2)The other offences, including most of the matters on the Form 1, were part of a course of conduct starting with the acquisition of a stolen car, and the break, enter and steals and ending with the offender's failure to stop and assist. 
(3)When a court sentences an offender for multiple offences (including when there are different victims) or sentences an offender who is already serving a sentence after conviction for other offences, a judge must ensure that the aggregation of all the sentences is a ""just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved"": see Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 307 & 308.
(4)Care must be taken not to double count matters of aggravation or mitigation or to the extent to which offences contain common elements, to punish twice: see Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [40].
(5)That extremely long sentences can have a crushing effect on an offender and, by inducing a feeling of hopelessness, destroy expectations of life on release. Such feelings can impede prospects for reform and rehabilitation, which cannot be in the community's interest.
(6)The real risk that further custody will institutionalise the offender and further reduce his prospects for reform. This concern applies even in the face of entrenched recidivism: see Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 at [24]. If possible the risk should be minimised and the opportunity for rehabilitation offered, particularly for young offenders who will be released to parole while still young. 
(7)Long sentences can have a compounding effect, in that their severity increases at a greater rate than the increase in length of the sentence: see R v M.A.K., R V M.S.K. [2006] NSWCCA 381.
(8)That, as was pointed out in M.A.K at [18], a sentencing court must take care when applying the totality principal, as confidence in the administration of justice requires the court to avoid any suggestion that there is some kind of discount for multiple offending. 

50These matters apply both in the formulation of the total sentence and the non-parole period. The weight given to such factors and the general purposes of sentencing may differ depending on the purposes inherent in each part of the sentence: see Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 at 531-532.

Special Circumstances
51There are ""special circumstances"" requiring the fixing of a long parole period because of:
(a)The accumulation of sentences. 
(b)Recognition that this sentences closely follows on a prior non- parole period.
(c)The offender's clear need for an extensive period of supervision in the community so that he has the opportunity, with help, to adapt to normal community life.
(d)The offender's need on release to parole to spent time in a fulltime rehabilitation facility, halfway house or Community Assistance Programme (COSP) centre. 
(e)The offender's need for engagement in the programmes recommended by Ms Nasr, Psychologist in Exhibit 1. 

52In submission, Mr Brown, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, suggested only minimal variation of the ratio between the non-parole and parole periods of the total sentence was required. He properly stressed the objective gravity of the three crimes and the need to deter others from engaging in such behaviour by the severity of the sentences imposed. 

53I agree with Mr Brown that these matters must be taken into account in fixing the minimum period of actual incarceration appropriate to the three offences. There must be adequate punishment, the first component of which is the non-parole period. On balance however, these matters important as they are, do preclude my finding there are special circumstances.

54As the offender will eventually be released there is also a community interest in fostering his rehabilitation. After a lengthy period in custody he will require a long period of support and supervision. It is in no one's interests that the present pattern of offending and custody continue. It is impossible to tell so far in advance whether the offender will take advantage of the opportunities my finding of special circumstances gives him. The interests of community protection and the offender's young age and obvious immaturity demand an attempt be made. He will have to earn the right to release, which will require an order by the State Parole Authority. Such an order will depend on the offender's behaviour in custody and his capacity, with support, to assume normal community life. If he cannot do so or if he does not respond positively to supervision, he will be returned to prison.

Conclusion
55The sentences will commence from the date the offender went into custody on 2 December 2010. The first sentence will involve a modest but discrete punishment for driving while disqualified. The totality of the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done. Given the course of conduct with many overlapping considerations both in mitigation and aggravation an aggregate sentence should be imposed for the principle offences, taking account of the Form 1 matters. That aggregate sentence will commence on 2 January 2011. 

56Guilty pleas were indicated in the Local Court. There must be a reduction in the otherwise appropriate sentences and total sentence of 25 percent to take into account the utilitarian value of those early pleas. 

57 The offender is convicted of each offence.

Disqualification Periods 
58His conviction for each offence requires he be disqualified from driving. The automatic periods of disqualification shall apply: 
(a)Manslaughter - 5 Years
(b)Aggravated Dangerous driving- 5 Years
(c)Drive Furiously - 2 years 
(d)Drive Disqualified - 2years

59As the offences all arose out of a single incident the total maximum period of disqualification is 5 years: s 25 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005. It shall commence at the expiry of his present disqualification period, which I am told is 17 December 2014.

60I accept I have discretion to impose a greater disqualification period: s188 (3)(d)(ii) Road Transport (General) Act. I do not do so because while the additional punishment of a much longer licence disqualification is thoroughly deserved, on release to parole it is in the community's interests that all efforts be made to encourage the offender's integration into the community and normal life. To this end the offender should not be unduly hampered in obtaining employment or assuming the responsibilities of citizenship. 

Sentences
61For the matter on the s 166 Certificate there will a fixed term sentence of 6 months to commence on the 2 December 2010.

62For the remaining matters there will be an aggregate sentence of 11 years 3 months, which will commence on 2 January 2011:

63I indicate, for the manslaughter of Mr Ferella, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a sentence of 10 years 6 months. 

64For the aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm to MS, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I indicate a sentence of 3 years 4 months. 

65For the third offence, furious driving occasioning bodily harm to JK, I indicate a sentence of 1 year 3 months.

66There will be a total aggregate sentence of 11 years 3 months with an aggregate non-parole period of 7 years 3 months to commence on 2 January 2011 and expire on the 1 April 2018. The offender will be eligible for consideration for release to parole on that date. There will be a parole period of 4 years to commence on 2 April 2018 and expire on 1 April 2022.

2759557,"R v HENZON, Kaycee [2012] NSWSC 726","REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HIS HONOUR:  The offender, Kaycee Henzon, has pleaded guilty to the murder of Nancy Margaret Brayshaw in her home at Epping on 19 November 2009.  She has also pleaded guilty to two counts of obtaining money of Ms Brayshaw by deception on 4 November and 18 November 2009.  In addition, she has asked that I take into account on a Form 1 two further offences of obtaining money by deception, on these occasions money of George and Helen Kozma. 
Facts
2The case is unusual because, although the offender has pleaded guilty to these offences, I have no evidence about what led to them and, in particular, no evidence of the circumstances in which the murder was committed.  The offender has not put forward any account of these events.  After her arrest she declined to be interviewed by the police, and she did not give evidence in these sentence proceedings.  That being so, I have a statement of facts which recounts the offences in chronological order and which, as far as the murder is concerned, can do no more than summarise the Crown's circumstantial case against the offender.
3It is necessary to set out the whole of that statement of facts.  With some minor amendments, it is as follows:
The offender, Kaycee Udele Henzon, born 17 April 1983, commenced employment with the National Australia Bank (NAB), Carlingford Branch on Tuesday 18 August, 2009, as a bank teller.        
The deceased, Nancy Margaret Brayshaw, born 7 January, 1937, was an account holder with the NAB Carlingford Branch. The offender met the deceased in the course of performing her duties at the bank.
Mr and Mrs Kozma
About 1.09pm on Monday 26 October, 2009 the offender conducted a transaction with a married couple, George and Hala Kozma, who held an account at the NAB Carlingford Branch.  The Kozmas disclosed to the offender that that they were returning to live overseas.  The victims completed a withdrawal voucher for $410.00 and received cash to that amount over the counter from the offender.  
Sometime later that day the offender added the number '5' in front of the '$410.00' changing the withdrawal voucher to read $5410.00, thus removing an additional $5000.00 from the Kozmas' account.  [First offence on the Form 1].
At 4.35pm that day, after the branch had closed for trading, the offender deposited $1,200.00 into her personal NAB account.  
National Australia Bank records show that a Customer Profile and Bank Account were created at the Carlingford Branch in the name of the mother of the offender on 3 November 2009, at 2.20pm. The offender opened the account using documentation in her mother's name. She did this by asking another staff member to help her create a customer profile and bank account in her mother's name.  Permission to do this was sought and given by a senior staff member. She provided her mother's identification documents to open the account. She said her mother was too sick to attend the bank herself.
About 3.58pm on Tuesday 3 November, 2009 the offender fraudulently withdrew a further $11,000.00 from the account of George and Hala Kozma.  [Second offence on the Form 1].  At the time the account holders were not present at the NAB Carlingford Branch.  At 4.01pm that date the offender credited $9,500.00 into the account of her mother, with a transaction narrative 'Fr: Mrs Deleon'.  At 4.05pm that date the offender credited her personal NAB account with $1,500.00 with a transaction narrative 'Physiotherapy'. 
Miss Brayshaw (counts 2 and 3)
At 2.36pm on Wednesday 4 November, 2009 the offender fraudulently withdrew $15,000.00 from the account of the victim Miss Brayshaw.  Miss Brayshaw was not present at the NAB Carlingford Branch at the time of this transaction.  [Count 2 in the indictment].  At 2.42pm the offender credited the NAB account of her mother with $2,000.00.  At 2.46pm the offender again credited the NAB account of her mother with $13,000.00 with a transactions narrative of 'ATO'. 
At that time the offender drew a bank cheque from the account of her mother for the amount of $22,500.00 made payable  to 'Larke Hoskins' (a Honda motor vehicle dealership).  This bank cheque was then used to purchase a 2009 Black Honda Jazz NSW registration BLR-73V on 6 November 2009.  
On 13 November 2009, the offender became aware that the unauthorised withdrawal of monies from the Kormas' account had been reported to the NAB.  
On 16 November 2009, the prisoner placed an on- line advertisement in the Trading Post seeking to sell the black Honda Jazz that she had taken delivery of on 6 November 2009. 
At 2.37pm on Wednesday 18 November, 2009 the offender fraudulently withdrew $100,000.00 from the account of Miss Brayshaw.  [Count 3 in the indictment]. At this time CCTV shows Miss Brayshaw is not in the Carlingford Branch.  The offender then credited this $100,000.00 into an NAB account in the name of her ex-husband's younger brother.  This account had not been used for several years and was in debit by $1.  The offender then drew a bank cheque that day for the amount of $99,999.00 from that account. 
The murder (count 1)
Around 10:06am on Thursday 19 November, 2009, the offender is recorded on CCTV entering the Eastwood branch of the Westpac Bank.  The offender is seen to complete a deposit slip before approaching a teller where the offender deposited the $99,999.00 cheque into the Westpac Account of the offender's mother.  At the time the offender made an additional payment to have the cheque cleared within 24 hours. In excess of $200,000.00 remained in Miss Brayshaw's account. 
Soon after, the offender drove to Miss Brayshaw's address and entered the house. 
Some time before 7 pm that day the offender drove to her residence at Unit 20, 1 - 7 Gaza Road, West Ryde, where she spoke to her partner Mr Rey Ramos and told him about an alleged sexual assault upon her.  The offender and Ramos then drove to the work place of the mother of the offender at Beecroft, and together they all drove to Eastwood Police Station to report this incident.  
About 7.00pm the offender attended Eastwood Police Station, where she reported an allegation of a sexual assault having been committed upon her earlier that day at 9 Cooke Way, Epping, the residence of the victim Miss Brayshaw.   
The offender was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where a Sexual Assault Investigation Kit (SAIK) was performed upon her.  
Following her attendance at the hospital the offender was taken to Ryde Police Station, where she provided an electronically recorded statement in which she gave police an account of the alleged incident. 
Henzon alleged an incident where she and Ms Brayshaw were assaulted by strangers - the account was a complete fabrication and the detail provided was false. 
Whilst the offender was at Royal North Shore Hospital, police attended 9 Cooke Way, Epping, the residence of Miss Brayshaw.  A boarder led police to the boarder's bedroom where she had located Miss Brayshaw deceased on the floor. 
Miss Brayshaw was found fully clothed laying on her back with both arms extended above her head. A white singlet was in her left hand.  
A Post Mortem carried out on Miss Brayshaw determined the cause of death was asphyxia. The pathologist, Dr. Rainie Van Vuuren, in her report provided a summary of significant post mortem findings. 
About 11.00am on Thursday 19 November, 2009, Andrew Lawler, a cousin of Miss Brayshaw arrived at Miss Brayshaw's residence to take Miss Brayshaw to a pre-arranged lunch engagement. 
A subsequent examination by a police expert of the offender's mobile phone showed triple 0 had been dialled 3 times, once at 11.28am and twice at 11.39 am, but each call was of zero duration.  The expert could not tell if the calls were terminated by the network or the user. 
A second witness who was in the front garden of the house next door to Miss Brayshaw's on 19 November 2009 described to police seeing a female matching the description of the offender walk down the driveway of Miss Brayshaw's premises from the rear yard to the street about 3.30pm.
On Saturday 21 November, 2009 the offender contacted investigating police and advised that she had further information regarding the alleged incident in which she was involved.  Arrangements were made by police to meet with the offender on Sunday 22 November, 2009.  
On that day the offender attended the Ryde Police Station, where she participated in an electronically record interview.  The offender again gave police a false account of events. 
About 5.15am on Thursday 10 December, 2009 police attended Unit 20, 1 - 7 Gaza Road, West Ryde and there arrested the offender.  The offender was conveyed to Ryde Police Station where she was entered into custody. 
Whilst in custody, in accordance with custody provisions, the offender had a telephone conversation with a solicitor.  About 8.40am Mr Laurie Myers, solicitor, attended Ryde Police Station and had a conversation with the offender.    Following that conversation, the offender declined to take part in an interview.  The offender was recorded formally declining to take part in an interview.  The offender was then charged with the murder of Nancy Brayshaw.  The offender appeared at Ryde Local Court that day where she was refused bail. 
In September 2010, the offender advised the prosecution that she had caused the death of Miss Brayshaw and offered to plead guilty to manslaughter. The offer was not accepted. Over the following months discussions were had between the parties in an attempt to settle an agreed statement of facts which could be tendered at committal in relation to a charge of murder. Agreement could not be reached and on 29 March 2011 the offender pleaded guilty to the murder of Nancy Brayshaw in Central Local Court, Sydney. She also pleaded guilty to the two charges of obtain money by deception on Ms Brayshaw, and two charges of obtain money by deception on the Kozmas. She was then committed to the Supreme Court for sentence. 
4This statement of facts was supplemented by some of the material in the Crown brief.  From that material it emerges that Ms Brayshaw's cousin, Mr Lawler, had spoken to her by phone a little after 7am that day.  When he arrived at her home at about 11am, he was unable to get any response from her after tapping on the kitchen window and calling out to her on two occasions.  He also rang her twice but the phone did not answer.  The evidence suggests that the offender was in the home at the time he arrived.  Phone records disclose a very brief call from the offender's mobile to Ms Brayshaw's phone at 10.27am, presumably to check that Ms Brayshaw was home after she had completed her deposit at the Eastwood branch of the bank.  Presumably, it would not have taken long to get from Eastwood to Ms Brayshaw's home at Epping.
5This raises a question whether Ms Brayshaw was already dead at the time Mr Lawler arrived, or whether his arrival precipitated the actions of the offender which led to her death.  It is consistent with the triple-0 emergency calls from the offender's mobile at 11.28 and 11.39am, although why those calls were immediately terminated remains unexplained.  The facts refer to the observation of a neighbour of a person fitting the offender's description leaving Ms Brayshaw's home some hours later, at 3.30pm.  If it was the offender, that also is unexplained.  All that said, I do not find these matters to be of any assistance in divining the circumstances of the murder. 
6Dr Van Vuuren's post-mortem findings and report were reviewed by Professor John Hilton, another forensic pathologist.  Put shortly, the cause of Ms Brayshaw's death was accepted to be asphyxia.  The evidence conveyed that pressure had been applied to her mouth, nose and neck, and other injuries were observed consistent with having been sustained in a struggle.  Finger nail scrapings from Ms Brayshaw disclosed DNA matching the offender's, and there was evidence that the offender herself had injuries also consistent with a struggle.
7The Crown prosecutor noted that at the time of the killing the offender was 26 years old and Ms Brayshaw was 72.  He submitted that the injuries inflicted upon the offender by Ms Brayshaw support the inference that she was fighting for her life in an attack mounted by the offender, and that I should conclude that the offender intended to kill her.  Counsel for the offender, Mr McClintock SC, argued that I should find that she acted with reckless indifference to human life.  The Crown prosecutor put his case on the basis that the intent was formed at or about the time of the killing.  He did not suggest that the killing was premeditated, that is, that the offender went to Ms Brayshaw's home for the purpose of killing her.  
8A decision on this issue is bedevilled by the lack of any evidence of the precise circumstances in which the killing occurred.  I have given the matter careful consideration, and I find that the evidence is as consistent with reckless indifference to human life as it is with an intent to kill.  That being so, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did intend to kill and she will be sentenced on the basis of reckless indifference to human life.  
9There remains the question of the offender's purpose in going to Ms Brayshaw's home that morning.  Robbery can be ruled out.  Police who attended the scene found $18,000 in cash in a readily accessible place inside the house.  Plainly enough, the visit was related to the offender's defrauding of Ms Brayshaw.  It followed upon her depositing into her mother's account the proceeds of her fraudulent withdrawal from Ms Brayshaw's account the previous day.  It may also have been influenced by her discovery some days earlier that her unlawful withdrawal of money from the Kormas' account was apparently under investigation.  That, most likely, is why she set about selling the Honda Jazz.  (Indeed, in the later afternoon of the day of the killing she had a phone conversation with a prospective buyer of that car.)  
10Mr McClintock argued that the facts were consistent with her attempting to marshall some of the defrauded money so as to reach a compromise with Ms Brayshaw.  However, I find it improbable that the purpose of her visit was to make a genuine arrangement to repay Ms Brayshaw.  I think it more likely, as the Crown prosecutor submitted, that she was seeking in some way to prevent the discovery of her fraud.  
11More than that I cannot say.  All that can be said is that there must have been a heated exchange between the two women which degenerated into a physical struggle.  The violence may well have been initiated by the offender, but I accept that it was spontaneous.  
Subjective case
12Apart from the offender's health, to which I shall refer, the information I have about her background is even more spare than the evidence about the offence itself.  All I know about her which is of any significance is that she was 26 years old at the time of the offence and is now 29, and she has no previous convictions.  
13Early in 2011, while in custody, the offender was found to be suffering from an auto-immune disease, which has been the subject of extensive medical investigation.  I have received reports from specialists in immunology and haematology, who have examined her at Westmead Hospital, together with a report from Justice Health concerning her management in the prison system.  She has been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and possible systemic lupus erythematosus.  The reports do not make easy reading but, as I understand it, these are disorders relating to the production of antibodies in the blood which affect the clotting system.  Associated with this, as I also understand it, is a diagnosis of thrombocytopenia, affecting the level of platelets in the blood, which are another important component of the clotting system.  
14From the report of Dr Badami, a staff specialist with Justice Health, it appears that her condition is being managed and she is being reviewed regularly by specialists at Westmead Hospital.  Her condition is stable, but it is difficult to provide a definite prognosis.  Associate Professor Ronald Walls, an immunologist, reported that the condition can be life threatening, adding in his report:
""Monitoring of her condition is required by a specialist, and while her condition is stable she should be seen on a three monthly basis.
Her life expectancy will depend upon future disease activity and it is governed by the underlying condition as well as the therapy that may be required.  If she runs a course which is characterised by quiescence of the disease process the life expectancy is not materially altered.  If however, she has an episode of disease activity requiring the use of potent immunosuppressive drugs then life expectancy can be reduced both on the basis of drug side effects but also the disease itself.""
15Dr Ken Micklethwaite, a haematologist, reported that he agreed with Professor Walls' comments about the prognosis and the effect on the offender's life expectancy, adding that ""the prognosis will only become clear as Kaycee is reviewed over time.""
16I also received in evidence two letters from Ms Margaret Wiseman, a chaplain at the correctional centre where the offender has been held.  Ms Wiseman describes her as a very caring person, who helps other inmates.  She is trustworthy in a responsible job which she holds in the prison, and staff find her to be polite and respectful.  She attends chapel regularly and, apparently, has had the benefit of spiritual counselling by Ms Wiseman.  She has been visited by her mother every weekend.  
Victim impact statement
17I received a victim impact statement from Ms Brayshaw's niece, Ms Katrina Leech.  It was a moving expression of her love of her aunt, and the grief and loss which this tragedy has caused to her, to her siblings and to members of her extended family, as well as to a young man whom Ms Brayshaw had supported and whom she treated as a son.  No doubt, the effects of this crime upon the lives of all of them will be enduring.  At the time the statement was read I expressed by deepest sympathy to the family and to all those affected by the death of Ms Brayshaw, and I do so again now.
Sentencing
18As is recorded in the statement of facts, the offender pleaded guilty to murder and to the two counts of fraud in the Local Court in March 2011.  Her case attracted the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Act 2008 (since repealed).  By virtue of s 17 of that Act, she became entitled to a 25% reduction of sentence because of those pleas.  
19I have commented upon the paucity of material in this case, both objective and subjective.  This is in no sense a criticism of the efforts of counsel on both sides and those who instructed them.  They all did the best they could with the limited material they had, and I have had the benefit of a competent and responsible presentation of the case by the Crown and on behalf of the offender.  
20While the objective gravity of the murder is difficult to assess, it is a serious offence of its kind.  It has its background in the offender's fraudulent conduct, and the authorities recognise that reckless indifference to human life is not necessarily less serious than other bases of murder.  On the other hand, it is significant in this case that the killing was spontaneous and was not accompanied by an intention to kill or, indeed, to inflict serious injury.
21The offender also stands for sentence for the two counts of obtaining money by deception, an offence under s 178BA (since repealed) of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 5 years.  These were the offences committed against Ms Brayshaw.  They are both serious fraudulent exercises, aided by the offender's status as a bank employee, for which no explanation is forthcoming.  In addition, two similar offences involving the Kosmas must be taken into account when I pass sentence for the murder.
22In her favour, the offender is entitled to rely upon her clear criminal record.  There is no evidence of remorse on her part apart from the fact of her pleas of guilty, but the facts disclose that those pleas were entered in the face of a strong Crown case.  In the absence of evidence about the circumstances of the offences and her background and community ties, it is difficult to assess her prospects of rehabilitation.  However, I would assess her as having reasonable prospects, given that she has no criminal history, she apparently has the support of her mother, and that Ms Wiseman considered that she appeared to be ""looking within herself"" and ""gaining insights that will help her return to the wider community a better woman.""
23There is no evidence that the offender's illness has affected her conditions of custody.  No doubt, it would be more easily treated and monitored in the community, but it seems that it is being adequately managed by Justice Health.  Nevertheless, she suffers from a serious condition which could be life threatening and the prognosis of which is uncertain.  That is a matter properly to be taken into account.  
24The offence of murder, of course, carries a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  It is apparent from my assessment of the objective gravity of the offence and the subjective matters favourable to the offender that there are ample reasons to depart from it.  
25I shall pass concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for the offences the subject of the second and third counts.  The sentence for the murder, taking into account the offences on the Form 1, will be cumulative upon those fixed terms.  For that reason, and because of the offender's illness, I find special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period.  That said, the relationship of the effective non-parole period to the aggregate sentence will be close to the statutory proportion.  In my view, a lesser non-parole period than that which I propose would be inadequate to reflect the offender's criminality, giving due weight to considerations of retribution and deterrence.  
26For each of the offences of obtaining money by deception my starting point for sentence would be imprisonment for 2 years.  That must be reduced to 18 months to reflect her plea of guilty.  For the murder my starting point would be imprisonment for 24 years, which must be reduced to 18 years for her plea of guilty.  I shall set a non-parole period of 13 years, which is itself only a modest departure from the statutory proportion.  The aggregate sentence, then, will be imprisonment for 19 ½ years with an effective non-parole period of 14 ½ years.  It will date from the day of her arrest, 10 December 2009, as she has remained in custody since that time.
27Kaycee Henzon, for each of the offences in the indictment of obtaining money by deception you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months, commencing on 10 December 2009 and expiring on 9 June 2011.  For the murder of Nancy Brayshaw, taking into account the offences on the Form 1, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years, comprising a non-parole period of 13 years commencing on 10 June 2011 and expiring on 9 June 2024, and a balance of term of 5 years, commencing on 10 June 2024 and expiring on 9 June 2029.  You will be eligible for release on parole on 9 June 2024.

2The Court is unanimous in its conclusions with respect to each of the grounds of appeal against conviction. However, we have reached different conclusions with respect to the appropriate orders. This judgment sets out our views in relation to the grounds of appeal. We have prepared and publish separate judgments in relation to the appropriate orders.

3At or around 4 am on 28 August 1993, Mr Stephen Gilham and Mrs Helen Gilham were murdered in the home they occupied at Woronora with their two sons, Christopher, aged 25, and the applicant, Jeffrey, aged 23. 

4The family was highly respected in the community. Both Christopher and the applicant were well regarded by both friends and neighbours for their scholastic achievements, their generally exemplary behaviour and character, and their loving relationship with their parents. The applicant was gregarious and popular, with marked success as a yachtsman. He was apparently his father's favoured son. Christopher was more quiet and sensitive although not without a supportive circle of friends. He was a keen and successful fencer and a talented pianist. 

5The family home was built on a split level with the upper and lower floors connected by an internal spiral staircase. External stairs provided access through a garden to the Georges River. 

6A double carport and single garage were located at street level, which housed a yacht as well as the motor vehicle the applicant customarily drove and his father's motor vehicle. The upper level of the house was accessed via stairs from the street, which connected with a side deck (or wooden walkway) that extended the length of the house along the upper level to glass sliding doors through to a living area. A dining table was immediately to the left on entry, and in relatively close proximity, but further into the room, there was a piano. Mr and Mrs Gilham's bedroom was also on the upper level. A short hallway connected their bedroom to the living space. The upper level also housed the kitchen together with a second bedroom, formerly occupied by the applicant, and a computer room. Christopher's bedroom was on the lower level. The lower level also housed a billiard table and small kitchenette. A rear door opened from the laundry giving access to the garden.

7The upper level was connected by external wooden stairs and a set of garden stairs to a boatshed, which the applicant used as his bedroom. An intercom system operated between the boatshed and the house. 

8Mr and Mrs Gilham both died from multiple stab wounds to the chest and back, after which a fire was lit on or near their bodies. It was accepted that the knife used to stab Mr and Mrs Gilham came from the kitchen in the main house. Mr Gilham sustained a total of 28 knife wounds of which 16 were to the front of the chest. Mrs Gilham sustained a total of 17 knife wounds of which 13 were to the front of the chest. Their badly burnt bodies were located on the upper floor of the house at approximately 4.54am, by fire officers who attended at 4.43am in response to a 000 call placed by a next door a neighbour at 4.34am, after the applicant alerted him both to the fire and the fact that his parents and his brother were dead. He said his brother killed his parents and set them alight and that he killed his brother.

9Mr Gilham was found face down in the bedroom. Mrs Gilham was found lying on her back in the hallway outside the bedroom, close to a bookcase on the top shelf of which was located the intercom and a telephone and answering machine. Evidence at post-mortem confirmed that all wounds had the appearance of being haemorrhagic, which was suggestive of their infliction while the deceased were alive. The order of the infliction of the wounds could not be determined. Although the time of death could not be fixed with any precision, the evidence was that they both died within minutes of being attacked. 

10A short time after locating the bodies of Mr and Mrs Gilham, fire officers found Christopher's body on the lower level. He had sustained 17 knife wounds to the upper body, of which 14 were to the front of the chest. His wounds were also haemorrhagic. He was naked save for a towelling shave coat. His body was unaffected by the fire which had been set on the upper level. A knife was located beside his body. It was common ground that the knife had been used to inflict the wounds on each of the deceased. 

11On 29 August 1993 the applicant was charged with the murder of his brother. On 5 April 1995 he pleaded guilty to his manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea upon the basis that it could not, as it was required to do, disprove that the applicant had been provoked into killing his brother upon discovering that Christopher had killed his parents. He was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, which was deferred upon him entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for 5 years. That sentence was premised on the basis that Christopher had murdered the applicant's parents and that this conduct had provoked him to kill his brother. 

12In June 1995 the Coroner found that the deaths of Mr and Mrs Gilham were caused by stab wounds inflicted by Christopher. 

13Following a renewed police investigation in 1999 a second inquest was convened. That inquest was terminated in April 2000, the Deputy State Coroner having found that there was evidence capable of satisfying a jury that a known person (the applicant) had committed an indictable offence (the murder of his parents). In July 2000 the Director of Public Prosecutions notified the applicant of his decision not to prosecute, having concluded, on the available evidence, that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction. 

14In May 2001 a private prosecution for murder was launched by the applicant's uncle. The following month those proceedings were taken over by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to section 9 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. The Director, as prosecutor, offered no evidence upon the information for murder and the applicant was discharged. 

15In October 2004 a third police investigation into the deaths of Mr and Mrs Gilham was commenced. In November 2005 a further brief of evidence was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking his advice as to whether there was sufficient evidence to charge the applicant with their murder.

16On 21 February 2006 an ex officio indictment was filed in the Supreme Court charging the applicant with the murder of his parents. On 28 November 2008 a jury found the applicant guilty of murder and on 11 March 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment on each count.

17The applicant appeals to this Court against his convictions and seeks leave to appeal against sentence.

18The appeal against conviction relies upon 18 grounds, some of which allege error in the conduct of the trial and others which relate to evidence not led at trial and which the applicant submits has been productive of a miscarriage of justice. A further ground contends that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. That ground requires an examination of the entirety of the evidence led at trial. 

The Crown case at trial

19Central to the Crown case were a number of related facts which the Crown Prosecutor submitted were proved by the evidence and which fixed a timeline within which the deceased were attacked and killed and the fire lit:

(a) Mr and Mrs Gilham, and Christopher, were attacked and died within five to ten minutes of 3.57am, that is, between 4.02 - 4.07am;
(b) the applicant knocked on his neighbour's door at approximately 4.30am to report the fire and the killings;
(c) the 000 call was placed at 4.34am;
(d) fire officers arrived at the scene at 4.43am;
(e) the upstairs bedroom window blew under heat and pressure at about 4.45am;
(f) the fire was under control between two to four minutes after water was applied through the blown window, that is, between 4.47 and 4.49am; and
(g) the fire had been ignited 20-30 minutes before being brought under control. Accordingly, the fire had been lit at the earliest at 4.17am and at the latest at 4.29am, the most likely time being 4.22 - 4.23am.

20The prosecutor submitted that the timing of this sequence of events proved beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant murdered his parents and that his account of seeing them dead and alight within a minute or so of his mother's call for help is a lie. 

The evidence of the neighbours

21The Crown alleged that within a period of five to ten minutes of 3.57am the applicant murdered his parents and then killed his brother. This time frame was fixed by the evidence of Ms Christine Shaw hearing what she described as a strange combination of two voices, in a ""screaming-type conversation shouting at one another"". Ms Shaw's house was built on a gradient on the opposite side of the road overlooking the Gilham house. She had woken at 3.40am and was in bed reading by 3.45am when she was alerted to the sound of the voices, one which she described as a man's voice, that reminded her of someone being struck by lightning, and one which she described as a very stressed high-pitched woman's voice speaking in a restraining tone, as if desperately trying to reason with the man. She was unable to make out any of the words. After a while she went to the window but was unable to see anything. The voices stopped while she was at the window. She estimated that the shouting lasted for about five minutes, possibly longer, before it stopped. She returned to bed and continued reading. She said a dog started barking when the conversation started and that it kept barking after the voices stopped. 

22Mr and Mrs Baker's house faced the Gilham house. They were stirred from sleep sometime between 4am and 4.15am by their dog barking, which continued on and off for about half an hour despite efforts to quieten him. They did not hear any raised voices. At about 4.30 Mr Baker got out of bed and went outside where he saw smoke rising from under the roof tiles of the Gilham house and a flickering in the side window. He told his wife to call the fire brigade.

23Ms Shaw only became aware of the fire after the arrival of the emergency services. The fire brigade arrived at 4.43am. She was unable to fix with any certainty the interval between when the voices stopped and when she was alerted to the arrival of the fire brigade by lights and men talking. She variously described it as being between 10 minutes and 20 to 25 minutes. 

24It was the Crown case that the female voice Ms Shaw heard was Mrs Gilham defending herself from the applicant's violence after he had attacked his father in the bedroom with such brutality that he had no time to defend himself. It was the Crown case that the male voice was Mr Gilham in the throes of death. The Crown submitted that the applicant was a calculated killer who said nothing at all as he stabbed first his father and then his mother. It was also the Crown case that there was an interval of at least 20 minutes after the applicant killed his parents (and then his brother) before he raised the alarm, during which time he took steps to destroy any evidence that would or might point to him as the murderer. These steps included sourcing accelerant and setting fire to the house, washing himself to remove any evidence of his parents' blood transferred to him during the knife attack, and washing the knife to remove his fingerprints. The Crown case was that he also washed off the blood which would have transferred to him when he stabbed Christopher to death.

25What the Crown relied upon as the 20-minute window of opportunity was fixed by reference to Ms Shaw's evidence and the evidence of Mr and Mrs Warner, who lived next door to the Gilham house. 

26Mr Warner gave evidence that he was woken up by two people arguing, which to his best recollection were two male voices. He conceded in cross-examination it may have been a man's voice and a woman's voice. He described them as being very angry, very heated and very loud. He said the conversation lasted 20, 30 or 40 seconds and that he went back to sleep. Although he looked at his alarm clock, he was not able to recall the time with any precision. He said that it was ""three something"". He agreed in cross-examination that he told investigating police that it was about 3.40-3.50am but accepted it could have been 3.57am. 

27He went back to sleep but was then woken by the applicant knocking on his front door. He gave evidence that when he opened the front door the applicant, who was dressed only in boxer shorts, seemed very agitated and mumbled something about ringing 000 and the house being on fire. 

28Access to the Warner property from the Gilham property was either from the street via a side gate or via the back lawn. There was no fence separating the rear of the properties and although there were pool gates they were always kept open. Mr Warner gave evidence that there was a hose at the rear of his house and he believed there was a tap at the boathouse on the Gilham property. He said that the side gate had a noisy latch which had woken him in the past and that he was confident that he would have woken if the applicant had entered via the gate from the street. It was the applicant's case that he left the burning house and went to the street and then immediately next door to the Warners'. It was the Crown case that the applicant had washed himself before entering the Warners' property from the rear. 

29Mr and Mrs Warner described the applicant as being very cold to the touch but neither wet nor sweaty. They said it had been raining and there was mist in the air. Neither of them gave evidence of observing any blood on him at that time although, while awaiting the arrival of emergency services and in the process comforting him after giving him both a sweater and a blanket to keep warm, they both gave evidence of seeing blood (or what looked like blood) on his foot and on the lower part of his left leg, which gave the appearance of being either washed or wiped or both. Mr Warner recalled seeing blood in the quick of the applicant's fingernail on either one or both hands. Mrs Warner did not remember observing anything on his hands or fingernails. Neither of them saw any residue of blood on their light-coloured leather settee or on the kitchen floor where the applicant had been sitting from time to time, or any smears of blood on the creamy white-coloured telephone which the applicant handled when speaking to the 000 operator.

30Neither Mr nor Mrs Warner described the applicant as out of breath when he first arrived. Mr Warner described him as speaking in a disjointed fashion, saying things such as ""They're all dead. He's killed them, set up them on fire"" and ""Mum and Dad are both dead. He's burnt them. I've killed him for what he did to them"". Mrs Warner gave similar evidence. She said that the applicant was agitated but not crying. 

31Although the time that the applicant arrived at the front door of the Warners' home could not be fixed with absolute precision, Mr Warner gave evidence that no more than two to three minutes (five minutes at the most) passed between the applicant knocking on the door and the call being placed to 000. That call was logged at 4.34am. In cross-examination Mr Warner said that the applicant attempted to dial the number but was shaking and distressed and pacing about and could not manage to put his finger in the dial, so he placed the call for him. Mr Warner gave evidence that the 000 operator asked him if the applicant had been drinking, so he lent over and smelled the applicant's breath. He said that he smelled what he thought was the smell of kerosene and a smoky smell which could also have been on the applicant's hair. He said this was consistent with what he had smelled when he opened the front door. 

32Mr Warner said the applicant came to the phone when the operator asked to speak to him. The applicant was asked by the operator to explain what happened. He said his brother killed his parents. He said he walked through the door; that his mother had called him; that he saw his brother with a knife; that his parents were on fire; and that he killed his brother after chasing him down the stairs. He said he did not know why he chased his brother. The Crown case was that the applicant was feigning breathlessness when speaking with the operator to give the appearance of truth to the lie that after stabbing Christopher he had immediately run from the burning house to raise the alarm. 

33It was also the Crown case that other aspects of the applicant's conduct that morning were a deliberate attempt by him to deflect attention from himself or the fire, and to feign concern for his parents. In the interval between the end of the 000 call and the arrival of emergency services Mrs Warner gave the applicant a burgundy sweater which he cuddled into with his hands without putting on. She said he got onto the floor in the kitchen in a foetal position. Mrs Warner also gave him a blanket to put around his shoulders at some stage while he was on the kitchen floor. It was the applicant's case that any residue of Christopher's blood would likely have been wiped off onto the sweater or the blanket. Neither was seized by police. Although according to the Warners the applicant did not say very much from his foetal position, at one point he grabbed a fire extinguisher and said he was going to fight the fire. Mrs Warner took the fire extinguisher from him. It was the Crown case that this was a feigned act of concern. 

The arrival of the fire officers 

34Fire officers from Sutherland fire station arrived at 4.43am. They were the first of the emergency services to arrive at the scene. They observed smoke issuing out of the eaves of the Gilham house. At 4.45am police and backup services were summoned.

35Fire Officers Langdon and Polson, under the command of Fire Officer Lowder, entered the property from street level. The applicant was at the base of the stairs leading from the street. He was described as extremely agitated, emotionally distraught and largely incoherent. He was saying that his parents were inside and that they were dead. Polson's evidence was that the applicant appeared to be delirious and disoriented and that he was crying. From his momentary dealings with the applicant Polson said his hair looked slightly wet and although there had been rain that morning it was not raining when they arrived at the house. It was an agreed fact that between 9pm on 27 August and 9am on 28 August 1993 2mm of rain was recorded at 3am at Sydney airport (15 km from Woronora).

36Langdon was instructed to take the applicant to the street. Lowder and Polson travelled along the side balcony to the rear of the house. Langdon wrapped a blanket around the applicant's shoulders and left him in the care of Mr Warner. He made no observation of smelling accelerant on the applicant. 

37After the arrival of the fire services Mr Baker saw the applicant with Mr Warner. He described him waving his arms around and mumbling in gibberish. Mrs Baker said he was jumping from side to side and running from side to side along the house. She said he had a blanket wrapped around him and was shaking uncontrollably and that he was being held by her husband and then by Mr Warner.

38Officer Wright was the designated pump operator who was at the rear of the fire truck when Langdon brought the applicant from the house. He said that when the applicant was about a metre and a half away from him he smelled petrol on him. His evidence was that he was familiar with petrol and was able to distinguish it from kerosene and methylated spirits and to distinguish petrol from a smoky smell infused with another accelerant. After the fire was knocked down and he entered the house to extinguish any spot fires, he did not smell any accelerant. He described the applicant as highly agitated, unable to sit still, and standing up and sitting down, but not crying. He was in the applicant's company for two to four minutes. 

39Fire Officer Pelham, who arrived from the Menai fire station, gave evidence that on his arrival smoke and fire were coming from the roof of the house. He said he saw the applicant standing near the garage alone, dressed only in shorts, and that he was highly agitated. The applicant said to Pelham: ""Don't go in there, somebody's got a knife"". It was the Crown case that the applicant was attempting to deflect the Officer's attempts to assist with fighting the fire in the hope that the fire would obliterate all evidence of his having murdered his parents.

40Senior Constable Sands was the first police officer to arrive at the scene at 4.50am. He saw the applicant sitting on the footpath with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders, apparently in Mr Warner's company. He did not speak with him. 

41As Lowder and Polson reached the sliding glass doors that opened from the upper floor to the external balcony, the rear bedroom window blew. This was about a minute and a half after they first arrived, that is, at or about 4.45am. Lowder opened the closed glass sliding doors but was unable to enter due to the excessive heat. The only light in the premises came from the fire. It was the Crown case that the applicant had closed the sliding doors as a method of accelerating or hiding the fire, which was inconsistent with his account to police that he left the house in a hurry to seek the assistance of his neighbours, leaving the door open.

42The fire was attacked through the main bedroom window from which flames were shooting. The bedroom was blanketed with water. The fire was reduced to a moderate level within minutes, permitting fire officers to then crawl into the house with another hose to extinguish the fire seated in the vicinity of Mrs Gilham's body on the floor on the right-hand side or southern corner of the room. Officer Pelham relieved Lowder and Polson, who had been forced to retreat from the excessive heat. They were both singed from the flashover effect of cold water contacting with open flame. 

43Pelham gave evidence that when he entered the house it was very smoky and hot. He located Mrs Gilham's body first and then as he continued to search for and extinguish the fire he found Mr Gilham's body in the bedroom. Fire officers with breathing apparatus assisted. Polson found an axe in the bedroom parallel to the bed. By this time the smoke had cleared. He also found Christopher's body downstairs. It was the Crown case that the applicant had taken the axe with him to his parents' bedroom in case his plan to kill his parents by stabbing them was frustrated for some reason, or in the event that Christopher came up the stairs roused by their struggle. 

44Under instruction from Lowder, Langdon went downstairs with Polson and Senior Constable Sands to check the lower level of the house, which they accessed by kicking in the rear door at the lower level. Langdon gave evidence that the area inside was dark save for the reflected light of a spot fire which was still burning upstairs. 

45Christopher's body was lying adjacent to a pool table with a knife next to one of his arms and near his chest. The pool table was in a living area with an open kitchenette. A bathroom and laundry were also located there together with Christopher's bedroom. The bed showed evidence of having been slept in. Lowder directed that the area be set up as a crime scene in accordance with the established protocol that nothing was to be moved by fire fighters. 

46Langdon also gave evidence that there was smoke at the ceiling of the downstairs living area. However, because of the largely uncontroversial evidence at trial that the levels of carbon monoxide in the bodies of the deceased indicated that they were all dead when the fire was lit, his evidence concerning the extent to which smoke from the fire upstairs penetrated the downstairs area, either before the fire was effectively extinguished or in the course of fire being fought, was not the subject of any testing. The crime scene officer Detective Sergeant Horn gave evidence that when he arrived at the house at about 7.12am there was no sign of fire or heat/smoke damage in the downstairs area, although there was fire debris on the staircase and on the tiled floor.

47The evidence at trial was that the concentration of carbon monoxide in the bodies of each of the deceased revealed on autopsy was within normal limits. This evidence was then relied upon by the Crown to establish that each of the three deceased were dead when the applicant lit the fire on the upper level on or near the bodies of his parents, with the intention of engulfing in flames the house along with the bodies of the deceased, thereby destroying the crime scene and any evidence that would, or might, have implicated him as the murderer. 

48Although the concentration of carbon monoxide in Christopher's blood at six per cent was significantly greater than that of his mother and father at four and three per cent respectively, it formed no part of the Crown case at trial that the greater concentration in Christopher's blood evidenced his proximity to the fire before he died. It was the Crown case that after stabbing his parents the applicant stabbed Christopher as he was coming up the stairs (probably in response to the same voices Ms Shaw heard or the Barkers' dog or both) and that the applicant then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest on the lower level as Christopher retreated back down the stairs, trying to escape from the attack, such that Christopher was at no time on the upper level. This was in direct conflict with the applicant's account to police, first given within an hour of the events, and his evidence at trial, that Christopher had killed his parents on the upper level and was in the process of setting fire to his mother (on one view of his evidence with his father already alight) as the applicant entered the house from the boatshed in response to his mother's cry for help over the intercom. On the applicant's account, Christopher was in direct proximity to the fire (and it must be assumed inhaling smoke) before the applicant chased him downstairs where he was killed.

The crime scene and forensics testing 

49A number of police officers, including Detective Sergeant Horn, gave evidence of their observations of Christopher's body in situ and the location of the knife. There was some controversy at the trial about the location of the knife, whether it had been moved, and the extent to which the water which had been used to extinguish the fire upstairs had contaminated the downstairs area, including the body of the deceased and his shaving coat, both before and after a tarpaulin was used to cover his body. This evidence will be referred to when considering whether the applicant has made good his challenge to the admissibility of expert evidence as to the likelihood of there being blood on the knife and whether water may have removed evidence of blood from the knife and of his parents' blood from Christopher's body. 

50There were no swabs taken from Christopher's body or from the knife. Of the 17 areas on Christopher's shave coat that were subjected to testing in November 1993 (each of which was chosen because it was an area not obviously related to the knife injuries Christopher sustained), only one had blood which could only have originated from Christopher. In the remaining 16 areas there was a HP type common to both Christopher and Mrs Gilham but which could not be further confirmed by blood type or further testing. There were no properties in the blood consistent with it being the blood of Mr Gilham. At the time of trial neither the shave coat nor the knife were available for DNA testing. 

51Swabs were taken from the tiled lower level near the steps that led to the bathroom/laundry; from near the spiral staircase; from the railing of the spiral staircase; from the cupboard door below the sink to the right of where Christopher's body was found; and from an upright ironing board above Christopher's body. Human blood, which forensic testing confirmed could only have originated from Christopher, was detected on each of these swabs. 

Blood stain pattern analysis of the blood on the lower level around Christopher and on Christopher's body

52A plan marked with generalised areas of bloodstaining, with particular focus on eight areas around Christopher's body, was prepared for the purposes of trial, using crime scene photos and videos and photogrammetry plans. This material was used for the purposes of eliciting evidence from three expert witnesses in bloodstain pattern analysis: Sergeant Reynolds, Mr Raymond and Dr Culliford.

53The blood droplets on the railing of the staircase included transferred blood and projected blood, including castoff blood that occurs when an object with blood on it is in motion. Sgt Reynolds said the most likely cause of the droplets on the railing was the placing of a bloodstained hand onto the balustrade, causing the blood droplets to be flung off, which would also transfer blood in the same process. He gave evidence that the blood spots on the front of the cupboards and the top of the ironing board were most likely castoff stains caused by a bloodied hand moving through the air, or from the weapon which was being used to stab someone on the ground causing blood to move through the air. 

54The Crown experts also gave evidence concerning the likely source of blood spatters on Christopher's chin and face, and more controversially, blood staining on his right hand, inner wrist and forearm. These areas of staining were revealed in crime scene photographs, which it was agreed were generally of poor quality. The reliability of any analysis was further undermined by the contaminating effects of water. The low spatter numbers and shapes of the stains operated as other impediments to any reliable analysis. 

55In relation to the spatter patterns on Christopher's neck and chin, it was generally agreed that the blood could have come from his wounds, especially those high on his body, or from Christopher hitting a bloodied surface. It was agreed that it was less likely to be the blood of his parents (or either of them) transferred in the process of Christopher attacking them, although that could not be discounted entirely. 

56In the view of two of the Crown experts, the directional spatter stains on Christopher's inner wrist and forearm gave rise to a reasonable possibility that this staining occurred in the process of Christopher stabbing his parents, although it was impossible to be certain of the origin of any of the blood without it being typed. The other possible source of this blood pattern was the defence injuries to the tips of Christopher's fingers, one of which went through the webbing between his thumb and forefinger, effectively running up his arm. Blood from under Christopher's fingernails on his right hand was collected and taken to the division of analytical laboratories, but was never analysed.

Blood stain pattern analysis of the blood on the applicant 

57Swabs taken from the applicant's left shin and right hand of blood or what appeared to be blood were not suitable for identification purposes when tested in 1993. A swab taken from the applicant's right foot was submitted for DNA testing in 1998; however, even at that time, DNA testing was still in its infancy. With the proviso that the results were below the laboratory reportable level, the Crown's expert witness gave evidence that there were strong indications that the DNA could be Mrs Gilham's. He gave evidence that it was definitely not the blood of Christopher or Mr Gilham. 

58Sgt Reynolds analysed the photographs of blood on the applicant's right foot which, on the Crown case, originated from Mrs Gilham. He said that the bloodstain would not have been the result of walking or stepping in blood. He was of the view that there appeared to be four individual areas of bloodstaining within the composite bloodstain, with voided areas between them. He said this pattern was either the result of contact between the applicant's foot and an irregular surface with blood on it, or from a blood drop of sufficient volume to travel under the force of gravity, landing above the flow area and running down the side of the foot. Mr Raymond gave evidence that the bloodstaining was not blood spatter but that it was consistent with contact between the applicant's foot and a bloody surface at the level of his foot, be it bloodstained clothing or some part of a body with wet blood. He said the more likely scenario was that blood had dropped from above and then looped onto the applicant's foot. 

Other items seized and/or submitted for forensic testing

59Spectacles were found in the downstairs bathroom. It was accepted at trial that they belonged to Christopher to correct his myopia and mild astigmatism. The Crown relied upon this evidence to support the submission that it was unlikely that Christopher went upstairs in the dark without his spectacles, and dressed only in his shave coat, to kill his parents, as distinct from him being roused from sleep and emerging from his bedroom in a panic upon hearing his parents being attacked upstairs. Although a former flatmate and a former girlfriend attested to Christopher having his spectacles at his bedside because he needed them to move from the bedroom to the bathroom, his ophthalmic surgeon gave evidence that in 1992 Christopher would have been able to negotiate a familiar environment quite well and perform everyday tasks without his spectacles (including going upstairs, pulling out a cutlery drawer, identifying one knife from another and identifying his mother as opposed to his father) but that he would have benefited from wearing his spectacles to view anything farther away than an arm's length. He gave evidence that Christopher's corrected and uncorrected visual acuity was below average but not far below average. 

60An empty packet of 24 Panadol tablets, and two empty 12-tablet packets of Panadol, were found in a clothes basket inside the laundry on the lower level, together with an empty 20ml syringe packet, a 25ml syringe with a white substance in it, a needle packet, a smoked glass cup with a white substance in it, and a silver table knife with a white substance on it. Subsequent forensic testing revealed the presence of paracetamol in the syringe and in the cup. Crime scene officers also photographed the contents of a plastic bag on the bottom shelf of a bookshelf in Christopher's bedroom, which contained two syringes and other items.

61The items from the clothes basket were tested for fingerprints in September 1993. At trial, the fingerprint officer who performed the testing gave evidence by reference to a fingerprint examination record (only some of which was written by him). He said the items were in a clean state, without smudges, partial fingerprints or portions of fingerprint ridges. He gave evidence that if these items had been handled in a normal way he would have expected to see latent indication of that handling and that the absence of that evidence suggested to him that either the prints (or partial prints) had been removed or the person handling the item was at pains to ensure that no latent prints were deposited. He agreed that there were no glove marks or wipe marks. He also agreed that where he recorded ""nil identifiable ridge pattern located"", this did not mean an item was absolutely clean. It was also consistent with someone having handled an item without leaving sufficient fingerprint marks in residue to be later identified. He also agreed that in a statement made months after the examination, in which he wrote ""I examined the exhibits and found nothing of evidentiary value in respect of fingerprints"", he was intending to report that there was nothing to enable him to positively identify or eliminate a person who might have handled the items.

62It was the Crown case that the applicant had planted the Panadol and syringe and other items in the laundry basket near his brother's bedroom to suggest that they belonged to him, and to reinforce what the applicant had predetermined would be the case that he would mount against his brother. This case was that his brother had murdered their parents because he was in a disturbed mental state. Dr Lawrence gave evidence that an injection of Panadol paste would result in illness, and ultimately liver failure if left unchecked for a couple of days. 

63Police located a 25-litre jerry can containing a quantity of leaded/super petrol and a length of garden hose with freshly cut ends in the small brick alcove area at the front of the house. The car used by the applicant operated on leaded petrol whereas the car used by Mr Gilham operated on unleaded petrol. A longer piece of garden hose was found in the garage. That hose was connected at one end to a tap. The other end also appeared to be freshly cut. Another section of garden hose was partly concealed beneath the small yacht and trailer. The exposed end of that piece of hose also appeared to be freshly cut. The freshly cut ends physically matched and under microscopic examination were confirmed to have been made with a knife. 

64It was the Crown case that the applicant had attempted, without success, to siphon petrol from his car by sucking on a section of garden hose he cut with a knife in order to set fire to the house, but that he was forced to use mineral turpentine as a substitute. The failed siphoning exercise was said by the Crown to be the source of the petrol that Officer Wright smelled on the applicant and what Mr Warner smelled on his breath, thinking it was kerosene. Three samples of carpet from the upper level of the house were removed for testing. Each was confirmed to contain mineral turpentine or a flammable hydrocarbon liquid similar to mineral turpentine. No container of mineral turpentine was found. Evidence was led in the Crown case that light-weight plastic containers would be readily consumed in a fire without leaving any discernible trace.

The applicant's account to ambulance officers and arresting police at the scene - in particular his claim that Christopher had possession of the knife and that the applicant took it from him 

65The ambulance arrived 4.57am and police at 5am, by which time the applicant had been directed by fire fighters to stay clear of the house. 

66Ambulance Officer Maudsley spoke to the applicant and asked him what had happened. He said: ""My brother killed my parents; he had a knife and set fire to them"". When he was asked by Maudsley why his brother would kill his parents, the applicant said: ""There had been a lot of arguments"". 

67Maudsley was also present when the applicant was spoken to in the rear of the ambulance by Senior Constable Parsons. When Parsons asked the applicant what happened, he said: 

""Was asleep. Mum called me, she was yelling... on the intercom. I came up, he was sitting there, said he'd killed them, he'd lit them and I think I might have killed Chris.""

When she asked where Chris was, he said:

""In the lounge room.""

When she asked where his parents were, he said: 

""On fire near the front door.""

When he was asked what happened next, he said: 

""I think I killed him. He said he killed them and I think I stabbed him. He was holding the knife.""

When the applicant was asked where he was, he said: 

""[I] stabbed him in the lounge room and then he [Christopher] ran.""

68Maudsley recalled the applicant telling the police officer that he struggled with his brother and that after he stabbed him (Christopher) he went down the stairs. When the police officer left Maudsley asked the applicant how his brother had set fire to his parents (Maudsley having not detected the smell of petrol). The applicant said: ""He just set fire to them"". The officer prepared a contemporaneous note which included the following: 

""He had initially heard his mother calling for help over the intercom, and when patient arrived parents were alight. Patient states brother had knife. A struggle occurred and he stabbed his brother and his brother went down the stairs.""

The applicant's account to police in the ERISP and the walkthrough interview and, in particular, his claim that he picked up the knife

69The applicant was taken into custody at the house. The following morning he was spoken to by the officer in charge, and he repeated that he had responded to a call from his mother via the intercom and that when he got to the house he was told by his brother that he had killed his parents and set them alight. He was asked what he did then, and said: ""I picked up a knife off the floor and chased him and stabbed him and this was [in] the pool room"". He told the police officer that he did not know why his brother had killed his parents. He said there had been some ""pushing and shoving"" between his father and his brother. 

70At 8.22 am on 28 August 1993 the applicant voluntarily participated in a lengthy electronically recorded interview (ERISP) and, later that afternoon, voluntarily participated in a walkthrough interview at his parents' home, which was recorded on a video camera. The walkthrough commenced in the boatshed where he reconstructed his movements from that point through to leaving the upper level of the house en route to the Warners' home via the street to raise the alarm. The police also invited him to identify the knife and his keys (which he did) and invited his response to their finding of the cut hose. 

71In the course of the ERISP the applicant said that he was unsure of what his mother was saying over the intercom, but that she said nothing to indicate to him that she was being assaulted. He said she was just yelling or screaming. He said he did not hear any voices in the background, or any commotion in the house as he rushed up the garden stairs to the upper level. He said that as he came into the house through the glass doors his brother set his mother alight by throwing a match at her or by putting the match to her. He said that when he was near his mother he saw his father was already alight on the bedroom floor, although he did not see his brother go into the bedroom or see him set light to his father. He said the fire spread quickly from his mother to his father. He said he could not smell any chemical or accelerant and could not explain why Mr Warner had smelled kerosene on his breath. 

72He said he made no attempt to put out the fire because he did not think of it. He said he did not know whether his parents were alive or dead, and did nothing to check whether they were alive, but that neither of them were moving. (The Crown submitted that there was ample opportunity for the applicant to put out the fire and that his failure to check on the condition of his parents is inexplicable.) The applicant also said that while there was nothing to prevent him from running from the house to raise the alarm or get help, or using the telephone which was located near the intercom, instead he picked up a knife which was near the piano and chased Christopher down the spiral staircase and stabbed him in the chest. He said that nothing was said by either of them at this time and that he had said nothing in response to his brother declaring that he had killed their parents when he first entered the house. 

73He said his brother was standing right next to the piano, about a metre from his mother's body, when he (the applicant) grabbed the knife. He said he could not remember holding the knife and that he did not know what he did with the knife after stabbing his brother with it. He said after stabbing him he went back upstairs, which was by that time full of smoke to the height of the top of the piano. He said he then left through the glass doors and went up to the street to his neighbours' house to raise the alarm. He said he did not know the time that had elapsed between stabbing Christopher and leaving the house. 

74He told police that after his girlfriend left he watched football on television with his parents. He said he was not sure what time he went to bed but it was before midnight. When questioned about the syringe and the Panadol paste found by police in the downstairs laundry, he said he had some syringes that he was going to use to build a model as part of his civil engineering course. He was unable to account for the paste. Professor Geoffery O'Loughlin, who supervised the applicant as part of his university degree in 1994, gave evidence for the Crown that the syringes and tubing had nothing to do with the particular project in respect of which the Professor supervised the applicant. However, the Professor conceded that the objects may have had something to do with an earlier project or a project with which the Professor was not involved.

75During the walkthrough the applicant identified the intercom. He said that when he heard his mother's scream he got out of bed, pulled on his shorts, and left the boatshed. He said this took less than a minute. He said that he habitually locked the door of the boatshed on leaving and that he would have locked the door before he went up to the main house in response to his mother's cry, taking the keys with him in the pocket of his shorts. The applicant's keys were found by police on the table immediately inside the glass doors of the main house. In the walkthrough the applicant said he must have removed them from his shorts and placed them on the table as he entered the room. Police also located a pile of clothes belonging to the applicant near a lounge chair in the lounge room. The clothes and upper soles of the shoes were partially burned. The applicant's then girlfriend gave evidence that the applicant was wearing these clothes and shoes on the night of 27 August 1993. 

76It was the Crown case that the applicant's claim that he locked the boatshed and took the keys with him immediately after responding to his mother's cry, and that he left his clothes and shoes upstairs after showering before going down to the boatshed, was a lie. It was the Crown case that the applicant did not go to the boatshed on the evening of 26 August but remained in the house in preparation for the planned murder of his parents. The Crown submitted that he had expected that his clothes would be incinerated in the fire and the fact that they were later found exposed his lie. 

77In the process of the walkthrough he demonstrated the route he took from the boatshed through the garden stairs to the upper balcony. He said that as he ran up the stairs he did not hear any fighting or arguing. (Evidence was led in the Crown case that it would take 22 seconds to run from the boatshed to the glass sliding doors of the main house and, at a steady jog, 30 seconds.)

78He said that when he walked into the house his brother, who was standing a few metres into the room near the piano, looked up at him and that, as he approached, his brother said that he had killed their parents. He said that by the time he crossed the room to where his brother was standing beside his mother she was ""alight"". He said his brother had lit a match and put it to his mother as he had walked to where his brother was standing. He said when he reached his mother her feet were alight. He said the fire then spread through the main bedroom to where his father was lying so that both his parents were alight very quickly. He did not enter the bedroom. He said the knife was on the floor below the seat of the piano and that he picked it up by which time his brother was heading to the stairs. He chased his brother downstairs. He said he did not know whether he stabbed his brother on the way down the stairs or when he got downstairs. He said he turned the light on, cornered his brother and stabbed him, and that his brother fell to the ground. He said he thought he kept stabbing him after that but could not recall how many times. He repeated that he did not know what he did with the knife. He then went back up the stairs to street level and went to his neighbours'. 

79The Crown relied upon the inconsistencies in the applicant's various accounts of how and where he obtained the knife in further support of the Crown case.

80The applicant told police that the previous night he and his father had tried to siphon some petrol out of the car to use for the boat (which was apparently kept near the river) but it was the wrong kind of petrol. He said that was why there was very little petrol in the jerry can that was found by police. During the walkthrough the applicant told police where the jerry can had been left. 

81It was the Crown case that this was a lie the applicant told to conceal the fact that he had unsuccessfully attempted to siphon petrol from his car to set fire to the house, forcing him to use turpentine as an alternative. The Crown submitted that turpentine, by comparison with petrol, was relatively non-volatile. The Crown led evidence from a number of people who knew Mr Gilham to the effect that although it was likely that Mr Gilham would mix his own two-stroke fuel for his boat (perhaps using super unleaded petrol, although standard fuel was more often used), being a meticulous person he would be unlikely to cut up a garden hose to siphon petrol from a car to prepare the fuel, particularly when, according to one witness, Mr Gilham had a siphon pump readily available. 

Evidence of activities in the Gilham household and family interaction on 27 August 1993 and the preceding weeks

82Evidence bearing upon this issue came from witnesses called in the Crown case as well as witnesses called in the applicant's case and the applicant himself. 

83The applicant's high school friend, Wayne Nolan, gave evidence that he went with the applicant to Cronulla after 5pm on 27 August to check surfing conditions. He gave evidence that the applicant told him that Christopher had been acting strangely in that he ""was going off at the drop of the hat"", especially towards his father, and that ""it's come to the push and shove stage between them"". When Mr Nolan asked what the applicant thought the conflict was about, he said that it could have been over money because his brother wanted to buy a car.

84Mr Nolan said that the applicant had mentioned the problem in his family more than once and that he was surprised to hear that Christopher was pushing and shoving Mr Gilham, as it seemed to him to be out of character. He said that the applicant seemed to him to be concerned by his brother's behaviour. He did not get the sense that the applicant was overly dramatising the problem. He said that the applicant refused an invitation to join him to watch a video that evening because he was expecting his father to return from golf and, given the way his brother had been behaving, he wanted to get home. Mr Nolan said he dropped the applicant off at his home at about 8pm with plans to go surfing the next afternoon.

85The applicant's then girlfriend, Ms Moskos, gave evidence in the Crown case that on 27 August she arrived at her boyfriend's home unannounced. Since the applicant was not at home she sat with his parents in the lounge room. She said Christopher came out from the computer room and said hello while she was talking with Mr and Mrs Gilham. He then took his coffee back with him into the computer room. She said the applicant's mother telephoned Mr Nolan to tell the applicant that his girlfriend was waiting for him. He arrived about 30 minutes later wearing the clothes that were discovered by police on the floor on the upper level the day after the fire.

86She said they shared a meal and then played pool downstairs before the applicant walked her to her car. She said that she was at the house for about two hours. As the applicant walked to the car he said to her: 

""What am I to do about my brother? It's pretty serious. I've never seen him so psycho. He is pushing my father around. I don't know what to do.""

87She said that the applicant seemed genuinely concerned. She said the applicant had told her about Christopher pushing and shoving his father and his general unpleasantness on at least three other occasions.

88She said that on one occasion about three weeks earlier the applicant told her that Christopher had been stomping around the house throwing things and was ""going off"" at his parents. About two weeks earlier, during a telephone conversation, the applicant told her that he was going to use the other phone (which she understood to be downstairs) because Christopher wanted to use the computer room upstairs and was ""going off again"". During the course of that conversation the applicant said: 

""Wait, Dad and Chris are having an argument. Chris is being really weird lately. Him and Dad have been pushing and shoving each other.""

89She asked the applicant if he knew what the argument was about and he said no. She suggested that he listen to the conversation but he said, ""I don't know what's going on but I think it's to do with money"". She asked him what money and he said ""I don't know ... if there is a fight I'll have to break it up"". She said he kept stressing that his brother had ""lost it"". He asked her advice about what he should do. She suggested that he tell his brother to grow up and that they (he and his father) should talk like adults.

90She gave evidence that there were no signs of aggression from any of the family members while she was at their home that evening. She said the applicant's mood was normal. He was casual, relaxed and friendly and she did not sense any friction or tension between him and his parents or his brother. She gave evidence that Christopher seemed a little edgy and, while he said hello when he came out of the computer room, he did not interact with her (although this was not unusual). She discerned some underlying tension between Christopher and his parents. She said that to her observation Christopher spent a lot of time on the computer and normally kept to himself. She also gave evidence that she did not hear the applicant talk with his father about petrol for a boat, nor did she hear any conversation about a planned boating trip with his father the next day, although it was not unusual for the applicant to be on a boat on weekends. She agreed in cross-examination that any talk about boats or plans involving boats would not have particularly interested her and she would be unlikely to have paid it any attention. 

The applicant's evidence

91The applicant gave evidence largely consistent with the account he gave to police at the scene, as elaborated upon in the ERISP and the walkthrough he participated in the following day. 

92In his evidence, however, he said that as he entered the house through the glass sliding doors and walked over to his mother, his brother was standing near the bottom half of her body, which was then ignited by Christopher, and that, on the approach, he (the applicant) could see the fire spreading. He also said he could at that time see his father's body alight on the floor of the bedroom and that the fire was spreading fast. He agreed that when he was interviewed he told police that when he looked from where his mother was lying and saw his father on the floor in the bedroom, there was no fire in that room. He said he was dazed when he was interviewed by police but that he was now sure that his father was alight, although he had only seen his brother ignite his mother. He denied that he was trying to convey to police that the fire had travelled so fast that there was nothing he could do to stop it, although he did agree that his impression was that the fire gathered speed and moved quickly. He accepted in cross-examination that when his mother called him from the boatshed, only minutes before he entered the house, he knew she needed help. He could not, however, account for why he said nothing to the effect that he was there to help her, or to check to see whether she was injured but still alive. He said he did the wrong thing by not trying to put the fire out. He agreed that when Christopher said he killed their parents, even though it was out of character for him to have acted with such violence, he did not question him but simply assumed his parents were dead.

93He said that when he chased Christopher he was not thinking that he had to kill him but rather that he had to ""get him"". He said he remembered chasing his brother and hitting him but did not remember stabbing him going down the stairs, or being in the pool room downstairs, although he accepted the evidence suggested that he stabbed his brother in the back on the way down the stairs. He agreed that he had stabbed him more times than was necessary to kill him. Although the red marks on his forearms observed by Dr Jennings at the police station after his arrest were consistent with him having struggled with his brother, and although the fact that the balls from the pool room table were found on the floor downstairs was also suggestive of a struggle, he said that he was unable to recall the details of any struggle.

94He denied that the reason for the differing accounts he gave to emergency services officers, ambulance officers and police as to where the knife was when he came into the room was that he realised by the time he came to be formally interviewed by police that his brother could not have been holding a knife and lighting a match at the same time, and that he would need to change that aspect of his story to accommodate that fact. His evidence was that he did not remember seeing his brother with the knife but he did remember picking up the knife from the floor. He was unable to explain how he would have been able to see the knife on the floor in the dark. He was also unable to offer any explanation for why his brother would have left the knife on the floor knowing that their mother had called for his help on the intercom, or why his brother would run down the spiral staircase and not out of the house, making his escape by that route.

95He said that as he was leaving the house after stabbing Christopher he could not remember any heat, but he did observe smoke. He said he had no difficulty breathing. He could not remember whether he looked towards his mother as he left to go to the Warners' house. He agreed that there were four phones in the house and that he had not used any of them to summon help. He said he went to the Warners' house via the front gate. He denied that he had washed himself or the knife before leaving or that he deliberately placed the knife close to his brother in order to implicate his brother in the murders of his parents. He was unable to account for why he was cold after running from a burning house. He denied that he was waiting outside the backyard area calmly and calculatedly in the night air for to the fire to take hold and to avoid being seen. He said he had no memory of anything that happened in the Warners' house.

96As regards the clothes found by police in the upstairs lounge room, the applicant gave evidence that he would normally have a shower in the evening in the main bathroom of the main house, leaving his clothes behind because his mother did his laundry. He said he followed that routine on the night of 27 August and then went to the boatshed to sleep. He denied that he remained in the house to carry out a premeditated plan to kill his parents. He denied any knowledge of the syringes and the Panadol paste in the laundry basket downstairs. He denied carrying the axe to his father's bedroom (which on his account was usually kept on the lower level of the house, underneath his brother's bedroom) as a backup if the plan to stab his parents did not work.

The grounds of appeal 

Ground 1: The trial judge erred in failing to stay proceedings.

Ground 2: The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury so as to give full effect to the previous acquittal of the applicant for the murder of his brother.

Ground 3: The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown Prosecutor to controvert the previous acquittal of the accused for murdering his brother.

Ground 4: His Honour erred in permitting into evidence a fire demonstration conducted by the Crown's fire expert, Mr James Munday.

Ground 5: His Honour erred in allowing into evidence opinions drawn from fire demonstrations conducted by the Crown's fire expert, Mr James Munday.

Ground 6: His Honour erred by allowing evidence from Dr Culliford and Dr Cala regarding their expectations of how much blood should have been on the knife.

Ground 7: His Honour erred by allowing evidence from Dr Culliford regarding her expectation of much blood the applicant was likely to have on him.

Ground 8: His Honour erred by allowing evidence from Dr Culliford, Dr Cala and Dr Lawrence regarding the similarity of the pattern of stab wounds.

Ground 9: That his Honour erred in permitting the Crown Prosecutor to hold a knife before the jury and have the applicant demonstrate his dexterity with the knife.

Ground 10: The trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor engaged in cross-examination of the accused in an improper manner.

Ground 11: The trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury in a manner that undermined the effect of the directions his Honour gave concerning the need to scrutinise the fire demonstrations with great care.

Ground 12: The trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury in an improper manner.

Ground 13: That the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

Ground 14: The applicant seeks to rely upon fresh evidence that the applicant's university timetable indicates that he would have been attending university on the afternoon that his mother left her place of employment two hours earlier than usual, indicating at that time that she was worried about one of her sons. The applicant seeks to rely upon fresh evidence from Steven Audet that the applicant attended a university lecture with him on the same Thursday afternoon. The corollary is that the son to whom the applicant's mother was referring was Christopher Gilham, not the applicant.

Ground 15: The applicant seeks to rely upon fresh evidence that there was a bloodied fingerprint on the intercom unit, thereby indicating that someone - who could only have been the now deceased mother of the applicant - had touched the intercom with her finger, which was consistent with the applicant's case at trial, and given contemporaneously to investigators, that she had contacted him by the intercom.

Ground 16: The applicant seeks to rely upon new evidence that the level of carbon monoxide in the lungs of the deceased Christopher Gilham indicates that he was alive and probably upstairs at the time of the fire.

Ground 17: The applicant seeks to rely upon new evidence that the fire is likely to have occurred in the manner described by the applicant and that the flames, far from being of a low height in the manner described in the evidence for the Crown by Mr Munday, were such as to prevent the applicant from any attempt to assist his mother.

Ground 18: The failure of the prosecutor to call Dr Cordner after the admission of the evidence of Dr Culliford, Dr Cala and Dr Lawrence regarding the similarity of the pattern of stab wounds, when viewed against the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

97Under Ground 16 the applicant seeks to rely upon new evidence dealing with the level of carbon monoxide in Christopher's lungs at the time of his death as contradicting the Crown case and supporting his case. In light of evidence from various witnesses received on the appeal, this ground of appeal also deals with the levels of carbon monoxide in the bodies of Mr and Mrs Gilham. To the extent necessary, we would grant the applicant leave to amend this ground of appeal to accommodate the fact that the new evidence also concerns the levels of carbon monoxide in the bodies of his parents. 

98There are three grounds of appeal against sentence. However, having regard to our conclusion with respect to the appeal against conviction it is unnecessary for us to consider these grounds.

Ground 1: The trial judge erred in failing to stay proceedings.

Ground 2: The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury so as to give full effect to the previous acquittal of the applicant for the murder of his brother.

Ground 3: The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown prosecutor to controvert the previous acquittal of the accused for murdering his brother.

99The first three grounds of appeal deal with the question of whether the trial ought to have been stayed, or an acquittal ought to have been directed, because the conduct of the trial challenged, or else controverted, the conviction of the applicant for the manslaughter of his brother. 

100It is appropriate, as the parties did, to consider these grounds together. The first step is to understand the history of the prosecution of the applicant.

101On 21 February 2006, the Director filed an ex officio indictment in the Supreme Court charging the applicant with the murder of his parents. 

102On 29 September 2006, the applicant sought, by notice of motion in the Supreme Court, a permanent stay of the proceedings against him upon the basis that it would be an abuse of process to permit the Crown to proceed against him on the charges of murder. 

103There were three grounds for that application. The first was that because of the delay in commencing proceedings, with accompanying prejudice to the applicant, it would be oppressive to subject him to a trial. The second was that it was not open to the Crown to seek from a jury verdicts that would be inconsistent with the applicant's conviction of manslaughter following his plea of guilty to that offence in 1995. The third ground was that it would be vexatious and oppressive to bring a further prosecution arising from the events of August 1993. 

104The notice of motion was heard by Howie J on 9-11 October 2006. On 21 March 2007, he delivered judgment, refusing to stay the proceedings: R v Gilham [2007] NSWSC 231; (2007) 190 A Crim R 303.

105On 21 August 2007, an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was heard against the refusal by Howie J to grant a stay. Judgment was delivered by this Court on 26 November 2007, dismissing the appeal: Gilham v R [2007] NSWCCA 323; (2007) 73 NSWLR 308.

106On 8 February 2008, the High Court of Australia dismissed the applicant's application for special leave to appeal against the judgment of this Court of November 2007: Gilham v Regina [2008] HCA Trans 85. The Chief Justice expressly indicated that the applicant would not lose his right to raise the same issues in the event of his conviction after trial.

107Pre-trial argument commenced on 4 February 2008 and the trial judge, Howie J, gave various rulings on evidentiary matters which he was asked to address in advance of the jury being empanelled. On 11 February 2008, a jury was empanelled to hear the trial. They were discharged on 18 April 2008 when they were unable to agree upon a verdict. 

108The applicant's second trial commenced on 13 October 2008. It was agreed in the course of this trial that rulings which had been given upon evidence in the first trial would be adopted without the need to re-argue the same issues. This, given the fact that the same trial judge was presiding, was a sensible and efficient way to manage the second trial. 

109The second trial commenced on 13 October 2008 and concluded on 28 November 2008, when the jury returned a verdict of guilty of both counts of murder. The jury had deliberated for eight days. 

110The applicant was remanded in custody. Submissions on sentence were made on 13 February 2009. On 11 March 2009, Howie J sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment on each of the charges of murder: R v Gilham [2009] NSWSC 138.

111The foundation for the earlier appeal to this Court (Gilham v R [2007] NSWCCA 323; (2007) 73 NSWLR 308) was a submission that the trial judge erred in finding that, in instituting the proceedings, the Crown had not controverted the earlier verdict and had not, therefore, acted contrary to the rule against double jeopardy. Spigelman CJ resolved the appeal on a different basis to the other judges. His Honour held that where ""the Crown accepts a plea to manslaughter in full discharge of an indictment for murder the appellant cannot be said to have been in jeopardy on the murder charge"" (at [87]). The Chief Justice concluded that the evidence available to the prosecution could not support a conviction on the charge of murder (at [95]). It followed that the acquittal of the charge of murder ""was not an acquittal which could attract the double jeopardy principle"" (at [96]) and the breach of the incontrovertibility principle did not justify the grant of a permanent stay.

112The other judges reached the same ultimate conclusion as the Chief Justice but their reasoning process differed. McClellan CJ at CL concluded that the applicant was ""relevantly in jeopardy when acquitted of the murder of his brother"" (at [197]). However, his Honour determined that although ""the factual basis for both the applicant's acquittal for the murder of his brother and conviction for his manslaughter are in conflict with his prosecution for the murder of his parents"" (at [209]) the prosecution for the murder of his parents would not be ""an abuse of process"" requiring the Court's intervention (at [222]).

113Hulme J carried out his own analysis of the authorities and concluded that in the circumstances of the case and, in particular, having regard to the fact that the indictment alleged the applicant had murdered two persons, there was no principle of law which required that the trial be permanently stayed. Hidden and Latham JJ agreed with McClellan CJ at CL on these issues.

114The applicant formally submitted that the earlier decision of this Court was wrong and renewed his right to pursue a further application for special leave.

115At his trial, counsel for the applicant submitted that the trial judge should exclude all evidence which called into question the applicant's conviction for manslaughter and acquittal for the murder of Christopher. It was further submitted that the reasoning of the majority in this Court in the first appeal meant that the trial judge was required to direct the jury to acquit the applicant. The trial judge rejected these submissions, ruling that the appropriate warnings or directions, rulings on admissibility of evidence, and other orders would cure any possible prejudice and ensure a fair trial.

116It is unnecessary to repeat the arguments put before this Court by which it was contended that the Court's previous decision was wrong. The novel issue in the present proceedings is the consequence for the applicant's trial of the previous decision with respect to the killing of Christopher. 

117The applicant submitted that he had been denied the full benefit of the acquittal for the murder of his brother: Garrett v The Queen [1977] HCA 67; (1977) 139 CLR 437. Because the issues in the trial involved a traversing of issues settled by the earlier verdict, it was submitted that the principle of res judicata would operate to prevent the trial proceeding: R v Storey [1978] HCA 39; (1978) 140 CLR 364 at 396.

118There was debate at the trial as to the directions which the trial judge should give with respect to the prosecution of the applicant for the death of his brother.

119The directions given by his Honour included the following:

""There have been a number of proceedings dealing with this matter over a long period of time. You will be aware by now that the killings occurred in 1993,15 years ago. There is a history as to why that is so, and you will learn about it. The history of it is relevant only as it relates to the evidence and the reliability of evidence. It has no other relevance in this matter. It may, however, explain why some evidence has been lost and is no longer available. It may explain why some people have given different evidence at different occasions. But that is the only relevance that the lengthy delay in this matter has. You should not be otherwise concerned at the delay or the history of the matter.

What happened is this: That the accused was charged initially with the murder of his brother. The three of them were killed: The mother, the father and brother. Three of them were stabbed to death. There was a fire set to the house which incinerated the mother and the father. The brother's body was downstairs. I think all of this was uncontroversial. Normally I know as much as the jury does about the trial and about the issues. But I was the trial judge in the earlier trial and therefore I have some knowledge of the matter and of the evidence that I expect to be called.

Anyway, the accused pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his brother on the basis of provocation and was dealt with by this court. Over a long period of time there were questions as to whether or not he should be charged and dealt with, or charged with the murder of his mother and father, and ultimately the Crown decided that he ought to be.

Again, none of that has any relevance except as to the history of the matter. It explains to you why we are here in 2008 dealing with the matter in 1993 and, as I have said to you, it will explain to you why some evidence is no longer available. What you make of that we will talk about later. It may also explain why some witnesses have no memory any longer of the events and why they have to rely upon the statements they made back in 1993. Again, we will talk about that at a later stage when you are aware of what the evidence is.

So there will be during the course of this trial some reference, I would think, to other occasions when witnesses have given evidence, either before the Coroner or at some other Inquiry or in the last trial in this matter. You should not be concerned at all that a witness has given evidence on other occasions. The only relevance of that is that it may reflect upon the evidence they give on this occasion. The evidence that you are concerned with is the evidence that you hear in the witness box of this court or evidence that is in some other way placed before you. But the fact that a witness has given evidence on other occasions may be significant when you come to look at the reliability, that is, whether or not you can accept, over the long delay, the evidence that's given before you.""

120His Honour gave the jury the following further directions in his summing up:

""Now, you will be aware by now that the accused was not charged with the murder of his mother or father in 1993. In fact, he was not charged with those offences until 2006. You know that he appeared in the Supreme Court in 1995 on an indictment charging him with the murder of his brother. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and that plea was accepted by the Crown; the result being that the Crown no longer prosecuted or continued the prosecution for murder. As a result, he was sentenced in the Supreme Court for the charge of manslaughter.

You have heard the statement of facts that were tendered, and they are in evidence before you. You cannot put too much weight on those really before you finish the picture, as it were, of this history of the accused's involvement with the criminal law up to 1995.

I pointed out to you that one obvious statement in the statement of facts is clearly wrong, and that is that the statement suggests the accused never went back up to the first storey of the house. Well we know he did. We do not know how it was that that statement of facts got fashioned in that way. I do not think it mattered the slightest bit to the sentencing judge, that particular fact.

One use that has been made of that statement of facts is that Mr Boulten indicated to you, during the course of his address, that there was a concession by the writer of those facts that the accused's account was feasible. That is irrelevant. Whether or not a police officer who wrote those facts thought that the accused's account was feasible back in 1995 has absolutely nothing to do with this issue before you.

Similarly, the suggestion in the statement of facts that there was a complete and thorough investigation, you might think, is rather putting the hyperbole on what was in fact a pretty ordinary investigation, but again that is not a matter with which you are concerned.

I have already told you that the fact that the police decided not to charge him with murder of his parents in 1993 is neither here, nor there. That is a decision made by particular police officers with a particular set of circumstances. Whether or not they saw any significance in the stabbing of the three deceased and what is accepted now to be the similarity of the wounds, again is neither here, nor there. Whether the Crown was correct to concede that the accused should be sentenced for manslaughter of his brother is neither here, nor there. They are decisions made by individual persons for reasons best known to that particular person in the circumstance of the facts that that particular person had before him or her at that particular time.

However, you might conclude that it would have been absolutely absurd to have this trial conducted without any reference at all to the history of these matters. You can hardly ignore that there was another body downstairs, the body of his brother. You could hardly ignore in the circumstances of this matter the accused's explanation as to the killing of his brother which is so far a part, so much a part of his explanation and account of the events. It would have led to the position that nobody would have been able to come along here and tell you things that related to the fact that the accused was charged in 1995 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. I have told you that it may explain why the exhibits were lost. It may explain why the accused now lacks a detailed memory of some of the events.

It is important, when it comes to the consideration of the question of his character, that he pleaded guilty. It has been put to you by Mr Boulten that it is a consistent approach that he has always taken. It was put to you that it was relevant that he has always, right from the start, said, in effect, that he killed his brother because of provocation. True it is that he was not able to tell the police in the record of interview why it was he killed his brother, but you might think that it may have been difficult at that time for him to enunciate in any degree of specificity what it was and what the emotions were that caused him to kill his brother, and it may, it is a matter for you, not be unreasonable for him to say in that situation, ""I can't tell you why.""

That is a matter for you, but it is all part of the circumstances in the history of this matter. As I have made it perfectly clear, this is not an inquiry and your verdict will not decide the correctness or otherwise of the police conduct in 1993 or the Crown's conduct in 1995.

There are two other reasons why it it is important that you have this history. One is that it allows people to come to this court and tell you facts and circumstances particular about the accused's character without any limitation based upon the fact that the accused was charged and dealt with for the manslaughter of his brother in 1995.

The other is that it shows a consistency in the approach of the accused and that it shows that he has always maintained the same story, the same account generally in relation to these events.""

121Counsel for the applicant sought stronger directions. His request was refused although his Honour recorded that objection had been taken and the applicant's position was accordingly protected.

122At his first trial defence counsel submitted that evidence should be introduced of the fact that in 1995 the applicant was acquitted, by operation of law, of murdering his brother. His Honour refused that application. The submission was repeated in the second trial.

123It was submitted to this Court that his Honour had erred by refusing to direct the jury that the applicant had been acquitted of murder. It was submitted that his Honour was erroneously concerned to avoid the need to direct the jury that they should give full effect to the applicant's previous acquittal for murdering his brother. It was further submitted that the proper application of the incontrovertibility principle would have the effect that his Honour should have directed the jury to acquit the applicant.

124After failing to convince the trial judge either to direct an acquittal or to give directions that the applicant should be given the full benefit of the acquittal for the murder of his brother, the applicant argued, in the alternative, that his Honour should direct the jury that the Crown's acceptance of the plea of not guilty for murdering Christopher Gilham, and the Court's judgment and orders convicting the applicant of manslaughter, were relevant to the jury's determination of whether or not the applicant was guilty of murdering his mother and father.

125It was submitted to this Court that his Honour's directions about the relevance of the 1995 proceedings were inadequate. The applicant submitted that the prosecution was contending that the applicant's explanation for killing his brother, namely that Christopher had killed their parents, was untenable, even though this account had been consistent from the applicant first reporting the killing to his neighbours and had been accepted as a reasonable possibility when the Crown accepted his plea of guilty to the manslaughter of his brother in full discharge of the murder indictment. The applicant referred to the fact sheet in the sentencing proceedings before Abadee J, which described the applicant's account as ""feasible"".

126It was submitted that the jury were entitled to gauge the validity of the Crown's assertion that the applicant's version of events could not reasonably be true by having regard to the facts that demonstrated that the police regarded his version as feasible. Relevantly, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions accepted in 1995 that they could not negative it and the Court entered a judgment of ""not guilty"" of murder and ""guilty"" of manslaughter of Christopher Gilham on the basis that the prosecution could not negative the possibility that Christopher Gilham killed his parents. It was submitted that these were all facts that were relevant to an assessment of the applicant's guilt in the instant case. The applicant argued that fairness required that the jury be directed to weigh these facts in the balance.

127In the course of the trial, the applicant pressed his objections, which included objection to the Crown Prosecutor advancing propositions in cross-examination of the accused to suggest that he had murdered his brother and that his brother had not murdered his parents. The applicant submitted that this amounted to running the case in a manner which was inconsistent with the sentencing proceedings and the applicant's acquittal of the murder of his brother.

128The applicant submitted that problems emerged early in the trial. He identified that the Crown Prosecutor opened to the jury in the following terms:

""It's common ground, ladies and gentlemen, that means we all agree, that each of the killings was done by a member of the family. The Crown case is that the accused, Jeffrey Gilham, killed his father, his mother and his brother that morning. The defence case, I expect you will hear, is that Jeffrey Gilham killed his brother Christopher after Christopher had killed their parents.""

129Accordingly, it was submitted that from the outset of the proceedings, the prosecution was contending that the applicant not only murdered his parents but that he killed his brother in circumstances where there were no circumstances of provocation justifying a verdict of manslaughter. It was submitted that the Crown Prosecutor, in conducting the case in this manner, had accentuated the controvertibility issues. It was further submitted that in her closing address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor highlighted the difficulties of incontrovertibility when she made the following submissions:


that ""it is inconceivable that two of them suddenly became killers in the space of 5 minutes""; 
that ""[the murderer] was Jeffrey Gilham calmly, calculatedly, over the period of three to four weeks, planning to kill his family and his plan was always to blame his quiet, older brother for the deaths of his parents""; 
that ""his plan included an outcome in which he could almost paint himself as something of a hero, something of a hero, that he couldn't help killing his brother because of the horror and grief that his brother had killed his parents""; 
that ""Chris Gilham needed his mum and dad"" ; 
that ""the accused didn't know, didn't care about his brother""; 
that there ""really is an undercurrent of disdain and a complete lack of respect for that older brother""; and 
that the jury should speculate as to the applicant's reason for killing his brother (""Did we see any respect for his brother? Far from it"" and ""why did he stab him, not once, and think ""Oh my God, what have I done?"" I've got him, he's falling."" No....There was a lot of hate in that stabbing"".

130It was submitted that the Crown Prosecutor then explicitly controverted the applicant's acquittal for murdering Christopher by making the following submissions:

""The accused has admitted that when he stabbed his brother he, too, clearly intended to kill his brother"". [T2.1405]

...

""The real situation, of course, is that it wasn't his brother with a knife, it wasn't his brother lighting the fire, it was this accused setting his dead brother up, and it doesn't stand together and it changes at that point"". [T2.1430]

131In summary, the applicant's submission has two limbs. It was first submitted to this Court that the trial judge was obliged to give full effect to the previous acquittal (for the murder of his brother), which would result in an acquittal by direction (for the murder of his parents). Secondly, it was submitted that the prior acquittal of murder and conviction of manslaughter was a relevant fact when determining whether the applicant murdered his parents.

132The applicant relied upon what was described as the principle in Garrett v The Queen, where a complainant had, during a rape trial, been permitted to give evidence of a previous alleged rape for which the accused had been acquitted. The trial judge gave the following direction (at 442-3):

""So it is also with the evidence that you have heard about the past prosecution for rape and the accused's acquittal on that charge. Again it would be an entirely wrong use of the evidence you have heard about that, meagre as it is, to say on the one hand, well, she couldn't pin it on him last time but it is a different story this time, or on the other hand, to say - she cannot make it stick this time any more than she could make it stick last time. Such an approach would be plainly wrong. The fact is we do not know and cannot know the basis of the jury's verdict, and we are not to speculate about it. We are not trying that case; we are trying this one. We do not know whether the verdict means that the jury thought that the accused was innocent in the true sense, or whether they thought the charge was not proven. We do not know whether they believed [the complainant] or not. We do not know whether there was any corroboration-I shall talk to you about this later - and if there was not, whether the jury simply heeded the judge's warning that it might be unsafe to convict without it. So you are to draw no inference either for or against the accused or for or against Miss Golding from the fact of that prosecution and its outcome.""

133The High Court held that the trial judge had erred by admitting evidence in relation to the previous allegation of rape. The Court also held that the summing up was defective. Barwick CJ said (at 444-5):

""It is apparent, in my opinion, that the trial judge, in an understandable endeavour to dissuade the jury from embarking on a consideration of the facts relating to the former charge of rape, did in substance tell the jury that the acquittal was a neutral fact. But it was not neutral and, if the prosecutrix were rightly permitted to give the evidence she gave, the acquittal was a dominant fact of which the applicant was entitled to full credit. To have said that the acquittal was neutral was to deny the applicant the full benefit of the acquittal and not to lay that emphasis upon it for which the circumstances called. Further, having regard to what I have earlier said as to the admissibility of the prosecutrix's evidence as to the events of November 1975, his Honour's explanation of the presence of the evidence before the jury was, in my opinion, unacceptable. Consequently, had that evidence been admissible, I would have thought the portions of the summing up which I have quoted would have themselves been wrong to a significant degree."" (Emphasis added)

134The applicant submitted that the prosecutor, by building the Crown's case on the premise that the applicant's account of what happened on the evening was specious and inconsistent with human understanding, had effectively called into question the earlier acquittal of the applicant which the Crown consented to - ""for if it defied logic to so accept the [applicant's] account, why did the Crown and the Court act as they did on the earlier occasion""? 

135These grounds of appeal raise issues of some difficulty. There is no case directly in point and plainly the facts of this case are unusual if not extraordinary. There is no manifest inconsistency in the verdicts of guilty of the manslaughter of Christopher and the murder of the parents. The fact that the applicant admitted that he was guilty of the manslaughter of Christopher is not inconsistent with his being accused of killing his parents. The issue in the applicant's trial was whether he had killed his parents. It was not in dispute that he had killed Christopher. It is of course true that the Crown accepted the plea to manslaughter in circumstances where the applicant asserted that it was his brother who killed their parents. However, there was no determination of that issue, the conviction for manslaughter evidencing only that the Crown accepted that it could not discharge the onus it carried to ""disprove"" provocation. Furthermore, there was no finding that the applicant had not killed his parents, although it must be assumed that the Crown concluded that the evidence which was available could not prove that Christopher did not kill his parents. As McClellan CJ at CL said in Gilham at [204]: ""there was no verdict acquitting the applicant of the killing of his parents. Furthermore, he has never been in any sense 'in jeopardy' for the alleged killing by him of his parents.""

136In R v Carroll [2002] HCA 55; (2002) 213 CLR 635 the High Court considered a controversy concerning perjury proceedings which involved the same ""ultimate and live issue"" (at [101] (Gaudron and Gummow JJ)) that had been the subject of the acquittal of the respondent for the killing of a child. The Crown brought proceedings in which it alleged the respondent had lied when he denied that he was the killer (at [103]).

137This Court discussed Carroll and the previous High Court decisions on this subject in its earlier decision. The inconsistency identified in Carroll, which had the consequence that the trial on the charge of perjury was permanently stayed, ""arose because the prosecution based the perjury charge solely on the respondent's sworn denial of guilty"" (at [649]). The verdict of acquittal necessarily meant that the jury had not rejected the respondent's denial that he killed the child. That inconsistency being manifest, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said that ""the case for a stay of proceedings was irresistible"" (at [42]). A finding that the respondent had perjured himself would have conflicted with the previous verdict of the jury.

138Gleeson CJ and Hayne J noted that the principle that an acquittal is incontrovertible rests upon an acceptance that what is decided in litigation is final. However, their Honours provided this important qualification at [50]:

""Finality of a verdict of acquittal does not necessarily prevent the institution of proceedings, or the tender of evidence, which might have the incidental effect of casting doubt upon, or even demonstrating the error of, an earlier decision. There may be cases where, at a later trial of other allegedly similar conduct of an accused, evidence of conduct may be adduced even though the accused had earlier been charged with, tried for, and acquitted of an offence said to be constituted by that conduct. R v Z [[2000] 2 AC 483], R v Arp [[1998] 3 SCR 339] and R v Degnan [[2001] 1 NZLR 280] are cases of that kind. In such cases, the earlier acquittal would not be controverted by a guilty verdict at the second trial.""

139In the present case the applicant was charged with the murder of his parents, an issue which has not previously been litigated and in respect of which there was no judicial determination. Of course, the earlier proceedings resulting in his conviction for manslaughter necessarily involved an acceptance by the Crown that it could not prove that the applicant had murdered his brother. However, there was no question raised, and no determination in the earlier proceedings, as to whether the applicant had killed his parents, which was the issue at trial.

140Although rejecting the applicability of the civil law doctrine of issue estoppel to Australian criminal law, Gaudron and Gummow JJ recognised in Carroll that the common law protected defendants acquitted of an offence from retrial for a subsequent offence where (i) the elements of the two offences are identical or (ii) the elements of one offence are wholly included in the other (at [91]). Their Honours said:

""Notwithstanding the inapplicability of the civil doctrine of issue estoppel in Australian criminal law, the common law of this country has sought to protect defendants acquitted of an offence from retrial for a subsequent offence where (i) the elements of the two offences are identical or (ii) the elements of one offence are wholly included in the other. Pearce v The Queen [[1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610] determined that that degree of coincidence between the elements of the two offences will ground a plea of autrefois acquit at common law. Again, this Court held in Rogers [v The Queen [1994] HCA 42; (1994) 181 CLR 251] that the tender of evidence of admissions which had been found in a prior trial not to have been made voluntarily would challenge directly that prior judicial determination, which had become final once verdicts were returned, and, on that basis, would constitute an abuse of process. Similarly, in Garrett v The Queen, evidence of a previous charge of rape of the prosecutrix, for which the accused had been acquitted, was held by this Court to have been inadmissible in a later trial of the accused in which he was convicted of rape and abduction in respect of different allegations involving the same complainant. The evidence was said by this Court to be inadmissible because it ""inevitably challenged the verdict of acquittal"" [at 445]. The Court allowed an appeal against the later convictions and ordered a new trial. 

However, in R v Storey, Stephen, Mason, Jacobs and Aickin JJ held that relevant evidence tending to show that the accused was guilty of an offence of which the accused had been acquitted may be admitted, but only if the jury can be and is directed not to interpret it in such a way as to deny the acquittal. In Storey, the two accused had been acquitted on a charge of forcible abduction; at their subsequent trial for rape, evidence was admitted which tended to show the forcible abduction of the victim, but without it being made clear to the jury that the evidence must not be taken as proving guilt on the previous charge. This Court dismissed the Crown appeal against the quashing of the conviction.""

141Analogously to Storey, evidence of the circumstances surrounding the killing of Christopher was relevant evidence which, on one view, tended to show that the applicant was guilty of an offence of which he had been acquitted. It was admissible if the jury could be, and was, directed not to interpret the evidence in such a way as to deny the applicant's acquittal of Christopher's murder.

142It is instructive to consider the cases cited by Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Carroll in support of the proposition that ""Finality of a verdict of acquittal does not necessarily prevent the institution of proceedings, or the tender of evidence, which might have the incidental effect of casting doubt upon, or even demonstrating the error of, an earlier decision"". One of those cases is the English decision of R v Z [2001] 2 AC 483. The defendant in that case was charged with rape. He had been prosecuted for that offence on four previous occasions, being convicted once. At his trial, the Crown proposed to call ""similar fact"" evidence from the four previous complainants in an attempt to negative the defendant's defence of consent or belief as to consent. The trial judge ruled, on the basis of the rule against double jeopardy, that the evidence from the three complainants of whose rape the defendant had been acquitted was inadmissible. The House of Lords reversed that decision. Lord Hutton delivered the leading speech. His Lordship reasoned that the evidence was not inadmissible merely because it showed or tended to show that the defendant was in fact guilty of previous offences of which he had been acquitted (at 504). Influential in Lord Hutton's reasoning was the fact that the evidence from the three complainants was not being used to show that the defendant was guilty of the offences for which he had been acquitted, but rather to prove, by similar facts, his guilt of the offence for which he was being tried (at 499). Lord Hutton held that in those circumstances, the principle of double jeopardy would not be infringed by the admission of the similar fact evidence. 

143The second case cited by Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Carroll is the Canadian Supreme Court decision of R v Arp [1998] 3 SCR 339, which also involved similar fact evidence. The appellant in that case had been convicted of two murders three years apart, charged on a single indictment. The killings bore a striking similarity to each other. The trial judge instructed the jury that they could use the similar fact evidence to reason that whoever killed one of the deceased must have killed the other. On the appeal, the appellant argued that it was wrong for the trial judge to instruct the jury in those terms. He drew an analogy with cases where the Canadian Supreme Court had excluded similar fact evidence that underlay a prior acquittal. On the strength of those precedents, the appellant submitted that because it was possible for the jury to convict the appellant on one murder count, but not the other, the jury's verdict was ""tainted"" to the extent that it relied on the similar fact evidence. Cory J, writing on behalf of the Court, rejected that argument. The Court pointed out at [77] that the Canadian decisions which prohibited the use of evidence underlying an acquittal in a later trial of the same accused did so on the basis of the Court's decision in R v Grdic [1985] 1 SCR 810, where Lamer J said at 825:

""There are not different kinds of acquittals and, on that point, I share the view that 'as a matter of fundamental policy in the administration of the criminal law it must be accepted by the Crown in a subsequent criminal proceeding that an acquittal is the equivalent to a finding of innocence' ... To reach behind the acquittal, to qualify it, is in effect to introduce the verdict of ""not proven"", which ... has never been ... part of our law.

However, this does not mean that, for the purpose of the application of the doctrine of res judicata, the Crown is estopped from re-litigating all or any of the issues raised in the first trial. But it does mean that any issue, the resolution of which had to be in favour of the accused as a prerequisite to the acquittal, is irrevocably deemed to have been found conclusively in favour of the accused.""

144It will later be necessary to address the point made in Grdic that a verdict of not guilty is to be treated in subsequent criminal proceedings as a finding of innocence. That proposition, if accepted, would have obvious implications for the applicant's case. For present purposes, however, it is relevant to note that the Arp Court held that the principle in Grdic did not apply to verdicts rendered by the same trier of fact where the charges are tried together in the same proceeding (at [79]).

145The third case to which Gleeson CJ and Hayne J referred in Carroll is the New Zealand decision of R v Degnan [2001] 1 NZLR 280, again a case involving similar fact evidence. The applicant in that case was charged with indecent assault on a male. The Crown sought to lead evidence from two other men that the applicant had subjected them to similar assaults. The applicant had been charged in relation to those alleged assaults. He was acquitted in one case and the other proceedings were stayed after two juries were unable to reach verdicts. The issue for the New Zealand Court of Appeal was whether similar fact evidence underlying a previous acquittal was inadmissible as a matter of law. The Court followed R v Z in holding that it was not (at [31]-[35]). The Court held that the proposed use of the similar fact evidence did not raise any question of double jeopardy. The applicant was entitled to the full benefit of the earlier acquittals, in the sense that he could never be tried again for the offences to which they related. But he did not have the added benefit of protection in future proceedings from relevant evidence that arose from events that were the subject of already concluded proceedings (at [33]).

146R v Z and Degnan suggest that the rule against double jeopardy does not operate where the way the prosecution seeks to prove its case incidentally has the effect of calling into question or proving the error of a previous acquittal. It would otherwise be a breach of the rule where that was the purpose of the prosecution. The applicant's case does not fall foul of the rule against double jeopardy, so understood. The Crown seeks to prove that the applicant killed his parents. It is correct that if proved the consequence must be that the Crown was mistaken in accepting the applicant's plea to the manslaughter of Christopher. However, fundamental to the acceptance of that plea was not a finding that Christopher had killed his parents, but rather that the Crown could not prove that he did not. Proof that the Crown accepted the applicant's plea on a false premise would not relevantly contradict the verdict of manslaughter, although of course it would suggest that the applicant was guilty of Christopher's murder in so far as it indicates that there was evidence to negative provocation.

147The Canadian decisions of Arp and Grdic suggest that an acquittal is an unequivocal finding of innocence and cannot be treated as a mere concession that the Crown could not make its case. However, this does not appear to be the position in Australia. In R v Darby [1982] HCA 32; (1982) 148 CLR 668 at 677, a majority of the High Court (Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ) approved the following observations made by Lord Salmon in Director of Public Prosecutions v Shannon [1975] AC 717 at 764:

""An accused is entitled to be acquitted unless the evidence satisfies the jury beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty. A verdict of not guilty may mean that the jury is certain that the accused is innocent, or it may mean that, although the evidence arouses considerable suspicion, it is insufficient to convince the jury of the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The verdict of not guilty is consistent with the jury having taken either view. The only effect of an acquittal, in law, is that the accused can never again be brought before a criminal court and tried for the same offence.""

148We note also the view of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Degnan, which said the following in relation to the Canadian decisions of Arp and Grdic (at [34]): 

""We find it difficult to endorse the approach taken in some of the Canadian cases that a verdict of not guilty is the equivalent of a declaration of innocence. That approach risks elevating perceived theory over the realities of criminal practice. In the vast majority of cases a jury, when returning a verdict of not guilty, cannot be taken as saying affirmatively they are satisfied the accused is innocent; what they are really saying is that they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused is guilty.""

149The Court of Appeal's reasoning in Degnan has even greater force where, as here, an acquittal on a charge is the result of a sentencing court's acceptance of a plea on a lesser charge rather than a jury verdict. For in that scenario, no trier of fact has made a determination as to the merits of the Crown case. Neither the sentencing court by acquitting the applicant of murder, nor the Crown by accepting a plea to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment for murder, can be taken to have affirmed the applicant's innocence of Christopher's murder. It follows that the trial judge did not err by failing to stay the proceedings or direct a verdict of acquittal. Accordingly, the first ground of appeal fails.

150There remains the question, central to the second ground of appeal, of what affording the applicant the ""full benefit"" of his acquittal entailed in the context of the trial. As McClellan CJ at CL recognised in the previous appeal, and as was inherent in the reasoning of Spigelman CJ (at [31]), the trial of the applicant for the murder of his parents could not take place without reference to the death of Christopher and the fact that the applicant admitted killing him. That required the trial judge to direct the jury in a manner which made plain that the applicant had admitted killing Christopher but had always denied killing his parents. Having been provided with the statement of agreed facts which was tendered at the trial, the jury were made aware of the history of the matter and the applicant's consistent response to the Crown's allegations. 

151In our opinion the trial judge's directions on these issues were appropriate save in one crucial respect. The trial judge correctly identified that the applicant's plea to manslaughter in 1995 was relevant to establishing the context of the alleged offences, the consistency of the applicant's account of the incident, and the reasons for delay in the laying of charges against the applicant for the murder of his parents. But if the plea to manslaughter was relevant to an assessment of the facts in issue, so too were the consequences that flowed from it, one of which was the fact of the applicant's acquittal of Christopher's murder. 

152Once it became apparent that the acquittal was relevant, the applicant became entitled to the ""full benefit"" of that acquittal: Garrett at 445 (Barwick CJ). Where evidence of an acquittal is admitted, it is not enough for a trial judge to instruct a jury, without further explanation, that a defendant is to be given the full benefit of his or her acquittal. The jury must be told what it means in the circumstances of the instant case to give the defendant the full benefit of the earlier acquittal: Washer v Western Australia [2007] HCA 48; (2007) 234 CLR 492 at [31] (Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ). In the context of the trial, that required the trial judge to inform the jury that the applicant's acquittal of murder constituted a formal acknowledgement by the sentencing court that the Crown could not, as at April 1995, negative the reasonable possibility that Christopher had killed Mr and Mrs Gilham, and that in doing so he provoked the applicant to kill him. That this was an assumption which underlay the acquittal is apparent from the agreed facts before the sentencing court, which read in part: 

""The accused has given an account of events to Police which in their simplest form are a feasible account of what may have happened. The investigation to date has been unable to refute that scenario, despite a thorough scientific analysis and evaluation of the scene and available evidence.""

153The ""feasible account"" to which the statement of agreed facts refers appears in the previous paragraph and reads as follows:

""The accused informed Police that he responded to a frantic intercom call from his mother after he was wakened from his dwelling, being a converted boatshed some 50-70 metres from the main house on the river line at the rear of the property. Upon entering the house the accused allegedly saw his brother Christopher standing beside their mother, who was lying on the floor, whom the accused presumed was deceased. As the accused approached his brother he (the accused) alleged his brother stated, words to the effect, 'I've killed Mum and dad', and with that saw a lit match in the brother's hand. As the accused drew nearer, his brother placed that match onto their mother's body which ignited immediately. The fire then spread rapidly to the main bedroom where the accused saw the presumed deceased of his father [sic] lying on the floor. With that, the accused stated that he responded and grabbed a knife, which was allegedly on the floor near to where his brother was standing, picked it up and chased his brother down a spiral staircase to a downstairs room where he fatally stabbed his brother a number of times ...""

154Of course, the weight to be given to the assumptions that underlay the acquittal was entirely a matter for the jury. However, the jury were unable to consider whether to attach any weight to the fact of the acquittal because the trial judge did not inform them of it. More than that, the following direction given by the trial judge denied the relevance of one of the assumptions embodied in that acquittal, namely that the Crown could not disprove the circumstance amounting to provocation:

""Whether the Crown was correct to concede that the accused should be sentenced for manslaughter of his brother is neither here, nor there. They are decisions made by individual persons for reasons best known to that particular person in the circumstance of the facts that that particular person had before him or her at that particular time.""

155The applicant was denied the full benefit of his acquittal of murder. The second ground of appeal must therefore succeed.

156However, the applicant was not denied the full benefit of his acquittal by reason of the manner in which the Crown Prosecutor conducted the trial. As the findings on Ground 1 have shown, the Crown was entitled to undermine the earlier acquittal solely as an incident of, or step along the way to, proving that the applicant murdered his parents. The Crown could not, and did not, mount a standalone argument that the applicant was criminally responsible for murdering Christopher. The Crown made that insinuation only to the extent necessary to prove that the applicant murdered his parents.

157We reject grounds one and three of the appeal but uphold ground two.

Ground 4: His Honour erred in permitting into evidence a fire demonstration conducted by the Crown's fire expert, Mr James Munday.

Ground 5: His Honour erred in allowing into evidence opinions drawn from fire demonstrations conducted by the Crown's fire expert, Mr James Munday.

Ground 17: The applicant seeks to rely upon new evidence that the fire is likely to have occurred in the manner described by the applicant and that the flames, far from being of low height in the manner described by Mr Munday, were such as to prevent the applicant from any attempt to assist his mother.

158The Crown called Mr Munday, who was the principal of a company which specialised in investigating fires. 

159He gave evidence of a series of experiments which he carried out, and filmed, the purpose of which was to assess the potential rate of progress of the fire. The Crown also relied upon the DVD of the fire experiments in an attempt to contradict the applicant's version that he was unable to assist his parents when he first came upon them. 

160The Crown Prosecutor argued in her final address to the jury, in rather forceful terms, that given the low height of the fire at the time it commenced, and its slow rate of spread, at least initially, the jury would not accept the applicant's evidence that he did not, or could not, go to his parents' assistance, and instead chased his brother down the stairs.

161When dealing with the evidence of the fire, the Crown Prosecutor said to the jury:

""There were many things which he could have done, and ... I suggest to you if it was your parents in danger of being burnt, you'd put it out with your bare feet, you'd do something. He expects you to accept ... that an innocent man would do nothing to put out that fire. It doesn't matter if it's 30 centimetres high. Well that just doesn't make sense, it doesn't add up ... that's what I have to say really about the fire.""

162There was no challenge to the expertise of Mr Munday to undertake the series of experiments, or to express a variety of opinions about the behaviour of fire. However, defence counsel objected to the DVD of the experiments being put before the jury. A voir dire examination took place. 

163In his evidence, and before the voir dire took place, Mr Munday was asked, without objection, to describe in terms of seconds and minutes the progress of any fire which would have developed upon application of an accelerant. He said:

""If there were mineral turpentine present, then the fire would develop relatively slowly at first and would gradually accelerate as the fire became larger. But certainly for the first 15, 20 seconds, maybe up to 30 seconds, the fire would remain relatively small and would gradually increase in size and then would increase more rapidly in size as the fire size grew.""

164Further, in the presence of the jury, when asked to give a further description of the fire where the accelerant being used was mineral turpentine, Mr Munday said:

""In the initial stages of igniting mineral turpentine on an absorbent material, the flames are likely to remain under 30cm high for the first 10 seconds. 

165From the voir dire examination, it became apparent that there were a number of variables, any one of which could affect the size and rate of spread of a fire, particularly in the initial interval of between 10 and 30 seconds. They include:

(a)the volume or quantity of accelerant used. There was no evidence at all which established the volume, or quantity of accelerant. The Crown's submissions to the jury do not suggest any particular volume or quantity;

(b)the floor area across which the accelerant had been spread, and the pattern of the spread. Mr Munday said that from the evidence he had seen, there was some accelerant in at least three discrete locations, but he was unable to say which was the ignition point of the fire. In particular, it is of importance to know whether there was a trail of accelerant between Mr and Mrs Gilham. There was no evidence that such a trail existed;

(c)whether the accelerant had been spread onto the bodies of either Mr or Mrs Gilham, and if so, whether it had soaked into any of the clothing they were wearing;

(d)the nature, extent and material which made up the clothing which Mr and Mrs Gilham were wearing at the time of the fire, and hence the extent of its flammability, and the locations where the fire would have burnt the bodies; and

(e)whether the fire was ignited on a horizontal or vertical surface, and the flammability of the particular material in which the fire was started.

Experiments

166The experiments were attempts by Mr Munday to simulate the behaviour of a fire in a variety of circumstances. As Mr Munday put it on the voir dire:

""What I tried to do was ... to formulate three hypotheses which would potentially explain the locations in which flammable liquid was identified, and also reflect the evidence given by other investigators.""

167The purpose of the experiments, he said, was to enable him to express an opinion about the speed at which, and the form in which, the fire spread. 

168Mr Munday accepted that the experiments did not:

a)replicate the carpet or underlay on the floor of the Gilham house because the nature and type of the carpet and underlay was unknown. In one experiment he used a nylon carpet and a polypropolene carpet in the others;

b)allow for the passage of oxygen under the carpet through the floorboards as in the Gilham house, because he conducted the experiments on a concrete floor;

c)accurately, or substantially, replicate the features of a body. In one experiment, PVC pipes were used to represent the legs of Mrs Gilham. In another experiment, pieces of timber were used. Nor did the experiments accurately replicate the clothing on the bodies. Mr Munday agreed that if there was accelerant-soaked clothing on the body, then the fire progression around the body would be far more rapid than if there were not;

d)replicate the temperature in the room at the time of the fire, which was unknown, whereas the ambient temperature in the cell where the experiments were conducted was 11.1 degrees. Mr Munday agreed that if the temperature was higher in the room when the fire occurred than in the experimental cell, then there would be a difference in the fire behaviour, although he thought that this was not significant; 

e)establish where the ignition point of the fire was, that is, he could not say where the fire started. Yet in the experiments, the fire is started in the immediate vicinity of the simulated body position; and

f)establish whether the fire was initiated on a vertical or horizontal surface which would impact on the rate of growth of the fire. He said that the flames would be bigger and the rate of spread of the fire greater if it was on a vertical surface initially. He did not attempt to replicate any vertical surface upon which a fire was initiated.

169In dealing with the objection to the DVD being admitted, the trial judge ultimately held:

""What I am minded to do is to allow this jury to have some idea of how the lighting of the substance: it's effectively up to the 10 to 15 [seconds] buildup.""

170Ultimately, having allowed the DVDs to be shown to the jury after an agreed editing process, the trial judge gave the following direction:

""But you still have to be very careful of experiments as they are called, and the reason is because it has been made apparent to you already that it was impossible to replicate the circumstances of this particular night, and you have heard that one of the problems is that nobody knows what the carpet was made of. As I understand it, nobody knows what the underlay of the carpet was made of. Nobody knows other matters that would possibly influence the way that the fire would progress. So what's been done here is an experiment, but a limited one, and it can only have limited assistance to you.

It seems to me that it is important to see how the fire progresses at least in the initial stage of the fire, and that is what we are talking about here, the initial growth of the fire until it starts on this exponential growth. But you should understand that it is not necessarily what would have happened on this particular night and certainly not necessarily what would have occurred to the accused or what the accused would have seen on this particular night and that is because we can't replicate all of the circumstances in which the fire took place. 

Further, there is another slight problem with the experiments ... it is simply the basis of the material upon which [Mr Munday] was acting - and that is, there is no attempt to replicate in any way the female body, and particularly the clothing on the female body, and it may be a very important factor as to whether this fire was commenced on the carpet or on the body ...

So just understand this is a very limited experiment, it gives you limited assistance. Don't put too much weight upon it as being an exact replica or even a very close replica of what had occurred on this particular night, it [is] simply to give you some understanding of how a fire progresses in these circumstances, and as I understand, the fire, as seen, doesn't change very much from what you've already been told about the spread of the fire, but rather than being told about it from various witnesses, it's perhaps better that you can see an example of it, as long as you understand the limited basis upon which you can use that evidence at the end of the day.""

171The applicant submitted that the content of the DVDs was irrelevant or alternatively, by reason of the application of s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995, that they ought not to have been admitted.

172Section 137 requires a court to weigh the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice to an accused. 

173The judge's directions based upon the evidence given by Mr Munday suggest that the experiments had very little, if any, probative value, in the absence of a sufficient correlation between what the evidence proved was likely to have occurred, and the experiments shown in the videos. However, as we have earlier noted, there was either insufficient evidence to prove a number of the variables upon which the experiments were based, or alternatively, the variables which were taken into account produced results which may or may not have replicated what actually occurred. 

174In those circumstances, the jury were left to do the best they could with a range of experiments which may or may not have coincided with the events that occurred.

175For these reasons, we conclude that these experiments had very little, if any, probative value. 

176But the prejudicial effect of these experiments was, in our assessment, very high. The Crown sought to demonstrate that the jury should reject the applicant's account that when he arrived at the scene, it was, in effect, not open for him to have done anything about the fire. After all, the prosecutor submitted to the jury, anyone would have taken steps, when confronted by a fire of low height and slow spread, to have put out the fire before doing anything else. 

177In support of that submission, the prosecutor relied on the visual impact of the videos. But they did not paint an accurate picture, and probably painted a most inaccurate picture supporting the Crown's submission. 

178In those circumstances, where there was a real risk that the jury were being presented with, and were being invited to act upon, an inaccurate picture of what occurred, there was a strong prejudicial effect to the accused. 

179The balance of these matters weighed heavily on the side of the prejudicial effect being significant and the probative value being little. The videos ought to have been excluded by the application of the provisions of s 137 of the Evidence Act.

180The next issue is whether the admission of this evidence caused a miscarriage of justice.

181In his summing up, the trial judge gave directions to the jury in these terms:

""In this case as the matter has ultimately been left to you, much of the problems or the disputes of the issues in relation to the fire evidence has disappeared. I will talk to you later about the relevance of that evidence, but what might have been complex, what might have been difficult evidence where it might have been necessary for you to review in detail the evidence of the witnesses in relation to the fire and the spread of fire and perhaps even try to determine which witness you particularly thought was persuasive when it came to the fire evidence, all of that seems to me, with great respect, to have disappeared. At the end of the day, so far as it seems to me, the fire evidence can be reduced to a very, very confined area. So much of the evidence on the fire can be disregarded.""

182His Honour did not return, in summing up, to discussing any of the evidence about the fire, its size or rate of spread. He did mention the evidence of Mr Munday, but only in a general way and in connection with assisting the jury with the usual instructions with respect to expert evidence. Nothing which he there said dealt with the detail of the fire evidence, the variables which may have contributed to the size of the fire, the reliability of the evidence, or its probative value. 

183In all of the circumstances, although the evidence ought not to have been admitted, we cannot be satisfied that by reason of its admission there was a miscarriage of justice. This is particularly so having regard to the fact that the evidence seems to have ultimately assumed a minor role in the addresses of counsel and the summing up of the judge. 

Ground 5: Admissibility of Mr Munday's opinion evidence

184Ground 5 deals with whether the opinions of Mr Munday on the fire, which he drew in part from the experiments he conducted and in part from his broader expertise, were admissible.

185In dealing with Ground 4, we have found that the evidence of the experiments which was tendered by the Crown ought not to have been admitted. But it does not necessarily follow that the whole of the expert opinion of Mr Munday is inadmissible. 

186An expert in formulating an opinion is entitled to draw upon a variety of sources, which may vary in their importance and the weight the expert gives them. For example, an expert was entitled at common law to give evidence of hearsay matters which went to demonstrate their expertise: Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; (2011) 243 CLR 588 at [69] (Heydon J). However, there is no doubt that where, in order to give an opinion in a particular case, an expert relies upon assumptions of fact as the basis of the opinion, it is necessary to prove, in admissible form, those facts or facts which are sufficiently similar, in order to render the opinion of value: Hawchar at [66] (Heydon J); Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; (1961)108 CLR 642 at 648-649; Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 58; (1985) 59 ALJR 844 at 846; R v Perry (1990) 49 A Crim R 243 at 249; R v Hilder (1997) 97 A Crim R 70 at 79.

187Mr Munday's expertise to give the opinion evidence which he gave was not challenged. He was adequately qualified. The general opinions which he expressed were within his area of expertise. They were relevant to the issues in the Crown case. 

188In so far as he based his opinion on facts about fire behaviour which he observed in the experiments and which were shown on the videos, our ruling that the videos were inadmissible would have the effect that any opinion based on that inadmissible material would itself be inadmissible. However, in so far as his opinion was based upon other assumed facts which were sufficiently proved in evidence, then it was admissible.

189No attempt was made at trial when objection was taken to Mr Munday's evidence to separate out that part of his opinion based solely on the videos of the experiments and to seek to have the balance admitted. Nor was a similar exercise undertaken on the hearing of the appeal. It is not a matter for this Court to undertake the exercise unaided by the parties.

190In those circumstances, we will proceed to consider this ground, as the parties' submissions did, upon the basis that Mr Munday's opinion was based upon the experiments which he conducted, the primary evidence of which was captured by the videos, and was to be proved by the tender of those videos. 

191On this basis, the opinion evidence of Mr Munday depended upon the admissibility of the videos of the experiments. In light of our ruling that the videos were inadmissible, we find that Mr Munday's opinion was similarly inadmissible. 

192However, for the same reasons expressed under the preceding ground, in light of the very limited use ultimately made of the opinion evidence, we are not satisfied that any miscarriage of justice has occurred. 

193This ground does not succeed.

Ground 17: New evidence about the behaviour of the fire

194The applicant sought to rely upon new evidence on the appeal from Dr Anthony Green on the topic of fire behaviour.

195We have already considered whether, at the trial, the DVDs of the experiments conducted by Mr Munday ought to have been admitted, and we concluded that they should not have been. 

196The evidence sought to be adduced on the appeal consisted of experiments undertaken to ""more accurately"" replicate the experiments that Mr Munday undertook.

197In light of the earlier discussion, and applying the principles set out at [545], it is only necessary to say that in respect of this ground of appeal:

(a) the material advanced by Dr Green was available at the time of the trial, and if it was to be relied upon, ought to have been called at that time;

(b) the material does not amount to fresh or new evidence of a kind that permits its admission on appeal; and

(c) the material principally deals with matters which ought not to have been admitted at the trial in any event.

198In those circumstances, we do not uphold the appeal on this ground. 

Ground 6: The trial judge erred by allowing evidence from Dr Culliford and Dr Cala regarding their expectations of how much blood should have been on the knife [given its use in the three stabbings]

Ground 7: The trial judge erred by allowing evidence from Dr Culliford regarding her expectation of how much blood the applicant was likely to have on him [from killing Christopher]

The significance of the evidence concerning both issues in the Crown case

199The Crown relied upon evidence that there was no blood (or no visible blood) on the knife, in combination with the fact there was too little blood on the applicant, as two of the fourteen circumstances proving the applicant's guilt. The Crown submitted that the absence of blood could only be explained by the applicant having washed himself to remove the blood of his parents (and to remove evidence of his fingerprints) before he placed the knife by the body of his brother to implicate him in their murder. 

The evidence of blood on the knife 

200The evidence of what was visible (or not visible) on the blade, or at the hilt or on the handle of the knife, came from two sources. The first, from those officers who attended the crime scene and saw the knife, and secondly, from a number of expert witnesses who were invited to consider that evidence, together with a photograph of the knife in situ lying next to the body of Christopher and a photocopy of the knife made during the post-mortem, and to offer an opinion as to whether the appearance of the knife corresponded with their expectations of the amount of blood that would likely be in residue on the knife after the infliction of more than 60 stab wounds. 

201Senior Constable Sands, the first police officer who attended the scene at about 4.50am, did not recall whether there was any blood on the knife when he forced entry to the downstairs area where Christopher was found. He said Christopher was wearing a shave coat which was wet or moist. Another police officer who attended at about that time said she saw spots of blood in the vicinity of Christopher's body, but there did not appear to be any blood on the knife. She did not remember any water being in the vicinity of the body. Her evidence was in conflict with the evidence of Sgt Ahern, the police officer originally in charge of the investigation. 

202His evidence was that the amount of water that was used to extinguish the fire would be likely to have affected the integrity of the crime scene, including the potential for any visible blood on the knife to have been removed given the physical proximity of Christopher's body to the knife and the water on the floor around his body. He said that by the time he arrived water was dripping onto Christopher's body and onto his shave coat. He said that he was not sure whether he saw water falling onto the knife although he said it fell close to where the knife was lying. He said he did not look carefully at the knife although he believed there would have been some water on the knife at that time. 

203Detective Rowan, a crime scene officer, gave evidence at the inquest. He was not called at trial. His evidence was read. He made notes at the scene including a description of the knife and a rough sketch of where it was located relative to Christopher's body. He made no note of visible blood on the knife. He said the knife appeared to be clean, which could have been due to the amount of water that had been cascading down onto the scene. He also gave evidence that once the tarpaulin that had been placed over Christopher's body was removed a blood stain on the shave coat had apparently run because of water dripping onto the body before it was covered. He agreed that if there had been sufficient water to wash blood off the knife then it should also have washed blood off Christopher's body. His evidence was that there was still a good deal of blood on the body. 

204Detective Senior Sergeant Horn, another crime scene officer, had a cursory look at the knife and did not see any blood on it. When Christopher's body was moved to allow Dr Lawrence to take his rectal temperature he was unable to say what happened to the knife. He gave evidence that he looked at the knife in situ but did not touch it. He did not notice a great deal of blood on it. He also gave evidence that he picked up the knife to examine the body and put it somewhere on the floor.

205The knife was eventually collected by police and wrapped in a rag before being submitted for fingerprint analysis. It had not at that time been analysed to determine whether there was blood on it. The following day the knife was produced by police during a walkthrough with the applicant, with a cloth around the handle. It was identified by the applicant. It was then returned to Sutherland Police Station and kept in Sgt Ahern's office. It was neither sealed as an exhibit nor entered into the exhibits register.

206A crime scene officer conveyed the knife in a paper bag for fingerprinting and then took it to Dr Lawrence. The knife was used by Dr Lawrence during the post-mortem, where a black and white photocopy of one side of the knife was made. 

207The knife was not subjected to a formal examination to detect the presence of blood. The fingerprint examiner treated the knife with superglue in a sealed container and stained it under a poly light. No print or partial print was recovered either from the blade or from the handle. He agreed it was very common to find no evidence of a fingerprint or palm print on a knife and that the chances of recovering fingerprints from a wet knife were much lower than from a dry knife. 

208He also gave evidence that there were no signs of blood on the knife. He said that any foreign stain on the blade or the handle would have shown up under the poly light in which case he would have referred the knife back to the physical evidence officer before proceeding to fume it with superglue. He said that while the superglue process would have destroyed any potential for grouping if blood were present, it would have shown up any blood as a slight stain, which would not have been destroyed in the examination, although its concentration would have been diminished. In cross-examination he agreed that if there had been blood visible on the knife he would have written ""a bloody blade"" in his notes. He made no note of that kind. He also agreed that he expected that any blood stain (or possible blood stain) would have been tested before he received the knife and that the particular task that he was asked to perform was not concerned with whether there was any blood on the knife. 

The evidence of blood on the applicant

209Evidence regarding where blood was seen on the body of the applicant came from those who saw him at the scene, including neighbours and ambulance officers, and Dr Jennings, who examined him after he was taken into custody.

210When the applicant arrived at the Warners' home he was wearing only boxer shorts. Mr and Mrs Warner agreed that it had been raining, that there was mist in the air, and that the ground was very damp. When he was sitting on the lounge Mr Warner said that he touched the applicant's hair, which was shiny but not wet. Mr and Mrs Warner both said he was cold to the touch but not wet. He was given a piece of clothing to wear but the applicant did not put it on; he just wrapped it around his hands. A blanket was put around him.

211Mr Warner saw blood on the applicant's feet. He could not say whether it was on one foot or both. He also saw blood on the little toe of his right foot and on the shin of his left leg, and blood in the quick of his fingernail. Mrs Warner gave evidence that it appeared to her as if there had been an attempt by the applicant to wash the blood off his feet and hands, as the staining on his lower leg was a pale pink, not a bright red. He was in the Warner's house for about ten minutes. He left the blanket behind. It was not seized by police.

212The applicant was outside the house when he was spoken to by fire brigade officers before the arrival of police and before he was taken into the ambulance. By this stage he had been given another blanket, which was wrapped around his shoulders.

213An ambulance officer noticed a ""spot of blood"" on the top of one of the applicant's feet. Another officer observed a small dab of blood on his right foot.

214A crime scene officer at Sutherland Police Station noted:

""I saw and photographed what appeared [sic] blood matter on his (1) inner right foot, swab A then (2) left shin swab B 
(3) right hand swab C (fingernail)""

215The same crime scene officer gave evidence at the inquest, which was read to the jury. He said that there appeared to be blood on the inside of the applicant's right foot, in one of his fingernails, and on the inside of his shin. This was the only blood he noticed after examining the applicant's entire body down to his boxer shorts.

216Dr Jennings examined the applicant at 12.05pm after he had participated in an ERISP. She noted a small amount of dried blood on the nail of the applicant's left index finger and a small amount of dried blood on the palm side of his right middle and index fingers overlying the middle bone. She also detected a small amount of dried blood on the nail bed around the edge of his right index finger and a small amount of dried blood on the arch of his right foot, towards the front of the foot. 

Evidence from experts concerning blood on the knife not the subject of challenge

217Sgt Ahern gave evidence that he had attended several multiple stabbings over the course of his career and had never seen a knife used in a stabbing without visible blood. There was no objection to this evidence.

218There was no objection to Sgt Reynolds, a crime scene officer, giving evidence of his experience as to the presence or absence of blood on a knife used in an assault or giving evidence that he had seen knives used in stabbing incidents, including of a person stabbed multiple times. Although he had no exposure to stab wounds inflicted on multiple victims in the one incident, he recalled an occasion where a knife had no visible blood on it after the infliction of a single stab wound. He described what crime scene officers call a ""fat effect"", which might explain why a knife used in a stabbing might be free of blood, in that the skin, being quite elastic, adheres to the knife blade and essentially cleans the blade as the knife is withdrawn from the body. He said clothing can produce the same effect. 

219He gave evidence that he was surprised that there was no visible blood on the knife considering that it had been used to inflict over 60 stab wounds, irrespective of whether the deceased were clothed or not. He concluded that something had happened to the knife blade after the stabbings to remove the blood. When asked about the likelihood of water contaminating the scene he did not think that was an adequate explanation. He said:

""... the rate that blood dries on a surface is a function of many variables, ambient temperature, wind speed, but it's always a function of the nature of the surface, porous, non-porous, rough, smooth, for example, and blood is very adhesive and persistent. If the blade has a reasonable amount of blood on it and 16 minutes later it was necessary to remove the blade (sic), my thoughts would be that it would have been washed in the sink, not just have water dribble on it.""

220There was no objection to Mr Raymond, a forensic expert, giving evidence of his expectation that there would be some blood residue on the knife used to inflict multiple stab wounds and the likely mechanism by which the blood staining on the applicant's right foot was transferred. He gave evidence that such photographs as were available from the crime scene were not very helpful in determining whether, and if so how much, blood was on the blade, the hilt or the handle. As to the likelihood of there being blood residue on a knife, he said that blood would run off a very smooth surface relatively easily unless the knife was very rusty, in which case residual blood would be a very thin smear. He said that in his experience the amount of blood typically found on a smooth knife was very little ""but it is there"". The knife in question did not appear to him to look particularly smooth and he was surprised not to see the appearance of blood. He accepted that may have been due to poor photographing of the knife. He said that oblique lighting will enable blood smeared on a blade to be viewed which would not be evident to the naked eye. He noted that it was very common to see blood on the handle of a knife because of the transfer of blood from the hand of the assailant. In this case the knife had a black handle so that blood would be difficult to see. When he was asked to offer an opinion as to whether a darkened colour at the serrated edge of the blade of the knife in the photograph was blood, he could not say one way or the other. He agreed that the mark was in a position where you might expect to see blood. In commenting upon the effect of water dribbling onto the knife, he said that blood not only clots but dries. He said a relatively thin smear would dry very quickly so that water that fell onto the smear would change the stain, probably making it difficult to see, but it would not eradicate it entirely unless the water had been running onto the blade for a period of time. 

The applicant's argument concerning Grounds 6 and 7 in summary

221Dr Culliford's evidence at the first trial was objected to on the basis that neither her training, study nor experience as a forensic physician qualified her to give evidence of her expectation that blood would be visible on a knife used to inflict multiple penetrating stab wounds, whether the blood consisted of a smearing of blood on the handle or on the blade, or was deposited at or near the hilt of the blade. It was also submitted that she was not qualified to give evidence that she would have expected more of Christopher's blood to be transferred to the applicant in the course of the stabbing for the same reason. Even if her evidence were admissible as opinion evidence, the applicant submitted, it ought to have been rejected in the exercise of discretion under s 137 of the Evidence Act.

222Objection was also taken to Dr Cala giving evidence as to his expectations concerning blood on the knife and blood on the applicant on the same basis. However, since he was not asked to offer an opinion about either of these matters in the second trial, it is unnecessary to determine whether or not the trial judge's ruling on the voir dire in the first trial permitting Dr Cala to give that evidence was in error. Dr Cala was asked by the Crown whether he expected that the wounds inflicted on each of the deceased would have bled profusely, differentiating between those wounds inflicted through clothing and those not covered by clothing. This evidence was not objected to. 

An additional basis for challenging the admissibility of Dr Culliford's evidence concerning the blood on the knife

223The trial judge was satisfied that Dr Culliford had specialised knowledge, based upon her training and experience as a forensic physician, to offer an opinion as to the likelihood of blood being in residue on the knife, and that firm directions would address any possibility of prejudice to the applicant by reason of the jury giving undue weight to the evidence. This was a ruling delivered in the course of the voir dire in the first trial which also inquired into the question of the admissibility of her evidence concerning similarity in the stab wounds. At that time the ruling was based upon the assumption that there would be evidence capable of establishing that there was no blood on the knife so as to satisfy the requirement that her opinion was relevant (see Dasreef at [30]-[32]). 

224Before Dr Culliford was called at the second trial, objection was taken to her giving opinion evidence on an additional ground. Defence counsel submitted that it had been shown by the evidence led at the first trial that there was no evidence, or no sufficient evidence, of the foundational factual premise upon which it was agreed that Dr Culliford's opinion concerning blood on the knife was based, namely that there was no blood (or visible blood) on it, and for that reason her opinion was irrelevant. It was not clear whether the objection was because her evidence failed to satisfy the preconditions to admissibility in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85], because of a failure to prove by admissible evidence the fact that there was no blood on the knife, or because her opinion failed to satisfy the test of relevance in s 55 of the Evidence Act, because the evidence about blood on the knife diminished the relevance of her opinion to the extent that it should not be admitted. (No further objection was taken to the admissibility of her evidence concerning the amount of blood she expected would be on the applicant. The applicant accepted that the ruling at the first trial applied to the second trial on that issue.) 

225Counsel reminded the trial judge of the warnings he had given to the jury in the summing up at the first trial concerning this aspect of the Crown case, which were given because of the state of the evidence as it then stood, in particular: the fact that the knife had been handled by police at the crime scene without ensuring that any blood that might have been on the knife was preserved; the fact that the knife was not tested for blood thereafter; the potential for water at the crime scene to have removed residual blood on the knife; and the fact that the knife was no longer available for forensic testing. 

226His Honour was satisfied that there was a sufficient factual foundation for the reception of Dr Culliford's evidence despite there being room for a legitimate attack on the reliability of the evidence upon which her opinion was based. He was satisfied that there was positive evidence, in particular from the fingerprint expert, that there was nothing to indicate the presence of any blood on the knife which, taken with the other evidence, was sufficient for the jury to consider Dr Culliford's evidence as part of the Crown's circumstantial case. He made it clear he would direct the jury accordingly, and even withdraw the issue from the jury's consideration if the evidence was further undermined.

227Before Dr Culliford was called by the Crown, the trial judge warned the jury of the potential for some aspects of her evidence concerning blood on the knife to be of little weight. He said: 

""The issue this witness is going to address, as I understand it, are two issues: Firstly, the absence or otherwise of blood on the knife. You know, of course, that there is an issue as to inspection and observation of the knife and whether anybody does know whether it had observable blood on it or not, and the possibility of the effect of water.

The second issue that this witness is going to give evidence about as an expert is about the blood that would be likely to be on a person who committed an act of violence with stabbing of another person. Again, it will depend upon the particular facts of this matter, and it is for you to decide what you make of this expert's opinion. 

Now, it may well be the case that, under further consideration, I will give you directions at the end of the day as to what weight you can give the expert opinion evidence in light of the facts before you. That remains to be seen as the evidence pans out in this matter and on hearing counsel's addresses to you. But just at the moment, don't put too much weight on expert evidence even though it can sound very dramatic from the witness box. Just accept at the end of the day you are going to have to assess the expert's opinion based upon the facts that you will find or are unable to find, and there are two major issues here, as I understand it: One, the presence or otherwise of blood on the knife, and two, the question of the amount of blood on the accused. They are two matters which are very much open to debate and open to a conflict of evidence. 

Just bear all of that in mind. We will hear expert evidence about blood splatter or blood resulting from various incidences such as stabbing. Keep in mind at the end of the day the expert is giving opinions and those opinions are based upon facts that you have to find and not the expert.""

228It was not suggested that the evidence at the end of the Crown case was in any different state from when counsel took the objection prior to Dr Culliford being called. The trial judge did not withdraw Dr Culliford's evidence concerning the absence of blood on the knife from the jury's consideration as he suggested he might. There was, however, no formal application that he do so. To the extent that the failure to do so is relied upon in support of Ground 6, which is not clear from the applicant's submissions, leave under rule 4 would be required. 

229It is not necessary to consider the question of leave as we are not persuaded that error has been demonstrated in admitting evidence of Dr Culliford's expectation that there would be blood in residue on the knife, whether on grounds of relevance or because her evidence failed to meet the criteria for admissibility under s 79 of the Evidence Act. 

230The trial judge did not distinguish between the sufficiency of her claim to specialised knowledge as a forensic physician to ground her opinion about blood on the knife and her opinion about blood on the applicant. He was satisfied that she was qualified to express an opinion about both issues. The applicant does not submit that she may have had specialised knowledge in one area and not the other.

Dr Culliford's evidence on the voir dire in the first trial 

231Dr Culliford based her opinion concerning the transfer of blood from Christopher to the applicant (and the blood from one or more of the three deceased to the knife) upon the knowledge of fundamental principles she acquired in forensic training undertaken as part of her Masters Degree and her training with police, as well as the application of that training in the course of her work over 20 years. (Dr Culliford's qualifications are set out in full at [278].)

232She said one fundamental or guiding principle was ""Locard's principle"", which assumes that if the perpetrator of a crime has entered a crime scene and has come into contact with a victim, there will inevitably be an exchange of material of some kind from person to person. She also relied upon her examination of three perpetrators of multiple stabbings and her observation that in two of the three cases there was blood on the hands of the perpetrator, one with blood on his clothing and another with a lot of blood on his body and on his hands. 

233She also gave evidence of a number of factors she had encountered in the course of her experience as a forensic physician affecting the transfer of blood to an assailant in the course of a stabbing. These were:

(a) the nature of the surface in contact with the blood. Skin is a rough surface such that blood (which is a sticky material) is likely to remain on the hand or be embedded in the nails of the assailant unless it is wiped or washed off;

(b) the amount of blood available to be transferred - the greater the number and type of wounds, the greater the amount of available blood;

(c) the area of contact between the victim and perpetrator - in particular, clothing worn by the victim may obstruct the transfer of blood;

(d) the length of time the contact occurs; 

(e) the number of contacts - a single stab wound is less likely to transfer blood than multiple contacts; and

(f) force of contact - the greater the force of contact (and depth of the wound) the more likely it is that blood will emerge from the wound.

234She accepted that there is no necessary correlation between the amount of blood dispersed during a violent event involving a knife and how the blood might be distributed, including the amount of blood likely to be found on the perpetrator. She maintained her view, however, that in the circumstances of this case, where she understood the applicant's hand had come into repeated contact with Christopher's naked chest (or near his naked chest) and/or his shave coat, through which the knife passed to inflict some of the wounds, she would have expected a transfer of Christopher's blood onto the applicant's hand. 

235The trial judge was satisfied that Dr Culliford's expectation that blood would be transferred from Christopher to the applicant as a result of the injuries he inflicted on his brother was a matter within her expertise, but that she should not be permitted to give evidence about blood spatter after her concession that she did not have specialised knowledge in that field. His Honour was satisfied that she had applied scientific principle, acquired in the course of her training and experience, and in the context of the various factors that might affect the application of that principle in this case, and in that way she was qualified to offer her opinion about the blood that she expected would be visible on the knife, and in greater quantities on the applicant as a result. His Honour went on to say:

""I have no doubt that Locard's principle is a matter of scientific principle. It is a matter, according to the witness, that she has studied and used in the course of her training and her experience. It seems to me that she is entitled to seek to apply that principle and affect the factors of that principle in a particular case and form a view that she might have expected as a result of applying the factors and the particular circumstances in relation to this particular case.

She explained in the voir dire how she came to the view she has. In my view, she could say no more than she expected more blood upon the accused by way of transfer to him by the stabbing of his brother. Again, if I am required to do so, I am quite happy to give such warnings or directions to the jury after this evidence is given in order that the jury do not misuse it in an inappropriate way. Again, it seems to me it is merely one of the circumstances which does not prove that the accused did either wash his hands or in some way seek to eradicate blood from him, it is merely one of the factors that goes into the general circumstances to be considered by the accused [sic], that so far as this witness is concerned, that she would have expected in the circumstances of this matter for there to be more blood upon the accused than was actually on his person.

...

Other than that, it seems to me that this evidence is relevant in that the witness is capable of giving evidence as a result of her expertise, that it has some weight and that its prejudice is not such that I should exclude it in light of the directions that I believe I can give in order to ensure that the jury do not give it more weight than what it deserves.""

236We can see no error in his Honour's findings that Dr Culliford was qualified to give her opinion concerning this question, or that the evidence was of sufficient probative value (as one of a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence) to guard against the possibility that the jury might give undue weight to the evidence. 

237Her evidence was thoroughly tested in cross-examination. In the summing up the trial judge identified the points of departure between Dr Culliford's evidence and that of Mr Raymond and Sgt Reynolds, the two experts qualified to give blood spatter evidence. His Honour also made specific and repeated reference to the multitude of variables that can impact on the amount of blood that might be spilt or exuded from the body of a victim of a stabbing incident and transferred to a perpetrator. We are satisfied that by identifying these issues, and the conflict in the evidence between the expert evidence called by the Crown, there was adequate insurance against the risk that the jury might misuse the evidence in the sense contemplated by s 137 of the Evidence Act.

238The trial judge also cautioned the jury against drawing any inference or conclusion that the applicant washed the knife based solely upon the fact that there was no visible blood on it, leaving it to the jury by other evidence in the Crown case to consider whether they were satisfied that the knife was washed. We note that in so doing he did not refer to Dr Culliford's evidence but to the evidence of the other experts to which no objection was taken:

""Let me say this... in relation to the visible blood on the knife. There are two problems in relation to this evidence that you would understand. The first is the lack of any testing or any scientific observation or examination of the knife. There is some evidence from which you may have been able to infer that there was no visible blood on that knife, and that simply comes from the evidence that people saw the knife and say they did not see any blood on it.

How reliable that is, is a matter for you, but you may think it is not very reliable in the circumstances of this particular case. Although I think there is some evidence, particularly from Sergeant Reynolds, that, all other things being equal, that he would have expected there to have been visible blood seen on the knife. He thought that some post-stabbing incident had occurred that removed any blood from that knife, if in fact there was no visible blood on that knife.

That brings me to the second point, and that is there may be a reason for there being no blood on that knife other than that the accused washed it, and that of course is the evidence of the water coming into the scene and falling into the vicinity of Chris and the knife at the time the fire was being extinguished. And, as I understand the scientific evidence, particularly from Sergeant Reynolds and I think Professor Raymond, it is not impossible that the falling of water during the course of putting out the fire did wipe any visible blood off the knife.

Now it may mean that there are still traces of blood on the knife that could have been shown up by the investigation, by proper examination and by proper testing, but as I understand, the Crown will correct me if I am wrong, Sergeant Reynolds accepted that one of the post-stabbing incidents that may have resulted in the lack of visible blood on that knife, contrary to his expectation, was the water coming down from the ceiling and impacting upon the knife and destroying any remnants of blood upon it. 

In that regard then you should be cautious about drawing any inference or conclusion based upon the fact that there was no visible blood on that knife or that there was no visible blood on that knife because the accused washed it. You may be able to make that inference from other factors, for example, if you were able to infer as the Crown said you would, that the accused washed himself, that may support a suggestion that he also washed the knife. You might think that that would be a matter of commonsense, but you cannot reason alone safely that simply because of the evidence about the lack of visible blood on that knife, that the accused must have washed it. You could not, in my view, come to a view even on a possibility that that was so. Again, that is an expression of opinion. It seems to me, however, to be one to accord with the evidence and it seems to me, with respect, that it would be irrational and illogical to conclude otherwise that the knife was probably washed by the accused simply because it had no visible blood on it in the circumstances of this particular evidence."" 

239We are not persuaded that Grounds 6 and 7 are made out.

Ground 8: The trial judge erred by allowing evidence from Dr Culliford, Dr Cala and Dr Lawrence regarding the similarity of the pattern of stab wounds.

Ground 18: The failure of the prosecutor to call Professor Cordner after the admission of the evidence of Dr Culliford, Dr Cala and Dr Lawrence regarding the similarity of the pattern of stab wounds, when viewed against the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. 

240Ground 8 challenges the admissibility of the evidence of Dr Culliford, Dr Cala and Dr Lawrence as to what they each claim was a discernible similarity in the grouping or pattern of wounds in all three deceased. This evidence was relied upon by the Crown to prove that the applicant had killed all three deceased and was therefore guilty of the murders of his parents. The applicant submitted that their evidence failed to meet the prerequisites for admission as opinion evidence in s 79 of the Evidence Act. The applicant also submitted that the evidence of all three experts ought to have been rejected in the exercise of the discretion under s 137 of the Evidence Act. 

241Ground 18 of the appeal concerns whether the Crown should have called Professor Cordner to give evidence on the question of similarity, and whether the failure to do so was productive of a miscarriage of justice. This ground of appeal became inextricably linked to the question of admissibility raised in Ground 8. 

242Over the Crown's objection we received Professor Cordner's report of December 2010, prepared at the request of the applicant's solicitors for the purposes of the appeal. In the report he is not only critical of opinions expressed by the Crown's experts, but identifies aspects of their evidence which he argues are both factually wrong and scientifically unsound. He also expressed the view that the Crown Prosecutor's arguments based upon that evidence were unfounded and misleading. 

243Professor Cordner was called by the defence on the voir dire convened in the course of the first trial to consider the admissibility of the evidence of Drs Cala and Culliford. The applicant submitted that the views Professor Cordner expressed at that time were the same views he expressed on the appeal, but the subject of a more detailed analysis in his recent report. 

244The applicant invited the Court to accept that were Professor Cordner called by the Crown at the trial his evidence would have been consistent with his evidence on the appeal and, if his evidence were accepted by the jury, it would have very significantly undermined the Crown case. Although the Crown objected to the tender of the report, and to the applicant calling Professor Cordner to give evidence because his evidence was neither fresh nor new, the report was not tendered as new or fresh evidence. Grounds 14 to 17, which are concerned with the reception of fresh or new evidence, do not include any claim that Professor Cordner's report is in that category. The only basis for receiving Professor Cordner's evidence was to determine whether his current views concerning the question whether there was a pattern or relevant similarity in the knife wounds sustained by all three deceased are consistent with the views he held at or prior to trial. If we are satisfied that they are, and we are satisfied that the Crown was aware he held those views, the question arises whether the Crown was obliged to call him at trial, or whether the assertion in correspondence with the applicant's solicitors prior to trial that he was ""plainly unreliable"" relieved the Crown of that obligation. 

245Given the extent of Professor Cordner's criticism of the accuracy of the opinions expressed by each of the Crown witnesses, the Court also received additional evidence from Dr Cala and Dr Lawrence, both in response to Professor Cordner's criticisms and by way of further comment from them on the question of similarity of the wounds. They each gave evidence and were cross-examined. The Crown did not tender a further report from Dr Culliford on the appeal and did not call her to give evidence. 

The applicant's argument concerning the admissibility of the evidence of similarity in summary

246The applicant submitted that the evidence of Dr Cala and Dr Culliford concerning the similarity of wounds was not admissible as their evidence failed to meet the test of admissibility for opinion evidence under s 79 of the Evidence Act. The applicant submitted that this was so even if Dr Lawrence, the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsies on each of the deceased in 1993, was entitled to give evidence that he observed a grouping of similar stab wounds on each of the deceased in 2000.

247The applicant further submitted that, even if admissible, their evidence ought to have been rejected in the exercise of discretion under s 137 of the Evidence Act, given the potential of the evidence from three Crown experts to overwhelm the jury's consideration of whether the Crown had proved the applicant killed his parents, where the probative value of the evidence used to assist in proof of that fact was slight. It was also submitted that there was a risk that the jury would adopt an inappropriate and unsafe process of reasoning to the conclusion that one perpetrator inflicted all the injuries from the mere appearance of similarity in the wounds that were inflicted. 

The significance of the evidence of similarity in the Crown case 

248In opening the Crown case to the jury the Crown Prosecutor relied upon what she described as a concentration of multiple stab wounds on the centre of the chest of each of the deceased, from which she suggested that it would be open to the jury to find that each of the deceased were stabbed in a ""very similar way"", thereby supporting the Crown case that the applicant had murdered his parents in relatively quick succession and then stabbed his brother. 

249Her closing address focused on what she described as the ""extraordinary similarity"" in the pattern of stab wounds. She submitted that the pattern was such that the wounds could not have been inflicted coincidentally, further supporting the Crown case that it was the applicant who inflicted the wounds on each of the deceased. In a document which the jury were given for the purposes of their deliberations, the similarity of the stab wounds, referable to the grouping and number of wounds on each of the deceased, was the first of fourteen separate circumstances relied upon by the Crown in proof of guilt.

250When the trial judge directed the jury as to what was meant by circumstantial evidence, and the way that they might approach an assessment of the various circumstances relied upon by the Crown in proof of guilt, he suggested that the amount of evidence called by the Crown bearing upon the similarity of the wounds, and the amount of time the Crown spent on the issue, might signify that it was a very significant part of the Crown case. The trial judge also added: ""... and you might think that it is [significant] ..."". He also went on to say that if the jury came to the view that they could not draw any conclusion from the evidence of similarity in the number and grouping of the wounds in light of the other circumstances in the case, or if they decided that the evidence did not assist them in determining whether the Crown had proved guilt and they disregarded that evidence altogether, that might make the Crown case a lot weaker than if another of the 14 listed circumstances were discarded by them. 

The evidence the Crown relied upon to prove relevant similarity

251The evidence from Dr Lawrence, Dr Culliford and Dr Cala concerning the issue of similarity was referable to the number of stab wounds on the body of each of the deceased, the grouping of the wounds on the chest and back areas, the configuration of the wounds, and the alignment of the wound tracks relative to the bodies of each of the deceased. 

252In different ways and with different emphases the experts each commented upon the similarity of the wounds referable to these features. In cross-examination, dissimilarities in the alignment of some of the wounds suffered by Mr Gilham and Mrs Gilham on the one hand and Christopher on the other were emphasised. Defence counsel also sought to neutralise the significance of the evidence of similarity by inviting each of the expert witnesses to concede that since it was common ground that the same knife had been used to inflict the wounds on each of the deceased, the shape of each wound would necessarily take the shape and dimensions of the blade and that the wound depths were also likely to be comparable for that reason. 

253Defence counsel also sought and obtained the concession, at least from Dr Culliford and Dr Lawrence, that the grouping of the wounds to the chest of each of the deceased was unremarkable given that the chest would be expected to be targeted by a person wielding a knife with an intention to kill. 

254The experts were not permitted to offer an opinion as to whether any of the features of similarity identified by them indicated or suggested that one or more than one person was involved in inflicting the injuries on each of the deceased. This was in accordance with the ruling given in the first trial that there was no field of specialised knowledge concerning the characteristics of stab wounds to render such an opinion admissible under s 79 of the Evidence Act. The trial judge also ruled at that time that none of the witnesses would be permitted to offer an opinion as to the degree of similarity between the grouped wounds, that being a matter exclusively for the jury to determine. There was no consideration given at that time, or during the subject trial, to whether the features of similarity relied upon by the Crown might provide a basis for the admission of the evidence as coincidence evidence under s 98 of the Evidence Act.

255One of the questions raised by Ground 8, although somewhat tangentially, is whether the trial miscarried because of the use to which the prosecutor put the evidence of similarity when she urged the jury to find that the degree of similarity in the pattern and grouping of the stab wounds, which she at various points described as ""extraordinary"", compelled the conclusion that there was only one perpetrator. (Ground 12 is concerned with other aspects of the Crown Prosecutor's address without specific reference to her repeated use of adjectives of this kind.) Those parts of her address are referred to at [319]-[324]. Although the trial judge did not permit Dr Culliford, or any other Crown witness, to give that evidence, and later directed the jury that there was no ""scientific basis"" to support an inference about the number of perpetrators from the pattern of the stab wounds, he did permit the Crown to lead evidence from both Dr Culliford and Dr Cala that they shared Dr Lawrence's views that the groups of wounds on each deceased were similar. 

How the issue of similarity emerged 

256It is important to trace how the evidence of similarity in the grouping or pattern of the stab wounds came to the attention of the prosecuting authorities. While that exercise will not be determinative of the question of admissibility, it does inform the question whether the Crown was obliged to call Professor Cordner as a witness. 

Dr Lawrence's findings on autopsy and the preparation of diagrams showing the location of the stab wounds

257Dr Lawrence performed the autopsies on each of the deceased in August 1993. The cause of death was reported as multiple stab wounds to the chest of each of the deceased. Extrapolating from the autopsy reports, Dr Lawrence gave evidence of the knife wounds on each deceased as follows: 

Mr Gilham
Mr Gilham sustained a total of 28 knife wounds - 27 stab wounds and one incised wound on the left jaw. Of the stab wounds 16 were grouped to the front of the chest, 5 to the back of the left shoulder and two to the back of the right underarm near the armpit. The balance were to the face, neck and left upper arm. One or more than one of five wounds to the back would have proved fatal penetrating the heart that way. 

The front of the body of the deceased was badly burnt and not all of the wounds to the chest were able to be tracked. Those that were distinguishable revealed an alignment from front to back, from left to right and downwards towards the feet. 

The track of the stab wounds to the back of the right underarm was from left to right and slightly upwards penetrating skeletal muscle.

Mrs Gilham
Mrs Gilham sustained a total of 17 knife wounds - 15 stab wounds and two incised wounds on the left forearm and the left hand, probably defensive type injuries. Of the 15 stab wounds, 13 were grouped on the back of the chest with the wound track from back to front and slightly downwards and with most wounds in a vertical alignment. A further single stab wound to the front of the chest passed through the left lung, the aorta and the right lung and there was a further single stab wound to the front of the neck. The wound to the chest, together with one or more wounds to the back, would have been fatal. 

Christopher Gilham
Christopher sustained a total of 17 stab wounds. There were 14 grouped wounds to the front of the chest and three to the back of the chest with a defensive type injury on the left hand and a superficial cut on the side of the face. Of the wounds to the back, two penetrated the skeletal muscle in the scapula (but not very deeply) while the third was close to the spine, penetrating the chest cavity and severing the lung and the blood vessels that run from the lung to the heart. The wounds to the chest were scattered across the central chest with the wound track from front to back and horizontally or slightly downwards in alignment. 

258During the autopsy the location of each of the stab wounds on each of the deceased, together with the length and depth of each of the wounds on the front and back of each of the deceased, was noted by Dr Lawrence on a pro forma anatomical drawing of a generic human figure. He did not make any observation of any similarity between the wounds on any of the deceased in the autopsy reports prepared in August 1993.

259For the purposes of the second inquest seven years later, Dr Lawrence prepared a side view of a different generic anatomical drawing of the upper body on which he marked arrows indicating the general direction from which the stab wounds to the chest and back were delivered to each of the deceased. It was at that time that he also prepared a transparent overlay of the same pro forma anatomical drawing he used in the autopsy, on which he traced the wounds from the post-mortem drawings for each deceased. This was to enable a comparison to be made between the relative location of the grouped stab wounds on the front of the chests of Mr Gilham and Christopher. To enable a comparison between those wounds and the wounds on Mrs Gilham's back, Dr Lawrence overlaid her transparency over the other two. It was this exercise which at the time excited Dr Lawrence's observation that the grouped stab wounds on each of the deceased appeared to him to be ""similar"", an observation which he volunteered to investigators. 

260The diagrams prepared by Dr Lawrence at the autopsy and for the purposes of the inquest were tendered in both trials without objection. At the point of the tender of the transparencies in the second trial the jury were invited by the trial judge to place the transparency showing the location of Mr Gilham's and Christopher's wounds over the top of each other and, after turning over the transparency relating to Mrs Gilham (so that the wounds entering the chest cavity from her back were shown as wounds to the front), to overlay that transparency over the other two. 

261The Crown's intention to rely on what was claimed to be a discernible similarity in the pattern of grouped stab wounds, in proof of its case that the applicant was the person who inflicted all the wounds, was flagged well in advance of the first trial. 

262The views of Dr Cala, Dr Oettle and Professor Cordner concerning that question were first solicited by investigating police in 1999 for the purposes of the second inquest in 2000. They each gave evidence at the inquest, as did Dr Lawrence.

263In the preparation of his report dated July 1999, Professor Cordner was invited to comment upon a number of areas reported upon by Dr Oettle, a forensic pathologist, who had by that time already provided his views to police about a number of matters considered by him to be of forensic significance. Commenting upon Dr Oettle's expressed view that ""the pattern of stab wounds in all these three people was very similar being concentrated in the area involving the heart and lungs"", Professor Cordner said:

""This is a true statement about stabbings in general. The vast bulk of homicidal stabbings involve the chest. The only similarity here is the number and the fact that they could all have been inflicted with the same knife. There is no specific peculiarity to tie the three together in my mind. Indeed, there are some differences. The mother had two incised wounds to the front of the neck. The brother had a superficial incised wound on the face. The father had an incised wound on the face and a stab wound on the neck. I do not think it is safe to conclude that the distribution and number of stabbed incised wounds in these three deaths are such as to indicate that the three deaths were by the one hand. I do not even think that it is a probable factor to be weighed in the balance - it is neutral in trying to conclude whether there was one or two murderers in this case. Conversely, one could say that as the wounds are consistent with being caused by the one knife, in this respect, the findings are consistent with Jeffrey's story. [This view became one of the bases of ""unreliability"" the Crown relied upon as justifying the decision not to call Professor Cordner at trial. It will be discussed later in this judgment]."" (Emphasis added)

264In a report also dated July 1999, Dr Cala took a different view to Professor Cordner. He said:

""The pattern of injury and indeed the causes of death in all three cases are extremely similar. The number of stabbings in two of the three victims are identical (17 times)...""

265He went on to say:

""...That these people should die in extraordinarily similar ways suggests to me the possibility that only one person was involved in the three deaths.""

266When Dr Cala gave evidence at the inquest he confirmed that this remained his view. When he was invited at the inquest to comment on Dr Lawrence's transparencies, he said:

""Q. Having seen that, prepared by Dr Lawrence, in relation to the similarity of the wounds to each of those, are you able to make any comment?
A. None really other than what I have said both in my report and what I have just stated, that they are remarkably similar and for two people to have been stabbed in such a violent way an identical number of times is remarkable, in my opinion.

Q. Now the two people relate to the mother and the son?
A. Yes.

Q. So that's remarkable, you say, in one respect?
A. Yes.

Q. The number of wounds. Also between the father and the son the positioning of stab wounds, do you also, having compared the transparency between each of them, do you make any comment about that?
A. There are many stab wounds on the front of the chest of both Stephen and Christopher Gilham, and fewer, although quite a number on the back of both Stephen and Christopher Gilham and in my opinion they are as I said, strikingly similar.

(Dr Cala's evidence at the inquest was tendered on the voir dire. Neither Dr Lawrence's nor Professor Cordner's evidence was tendered.)

267Dr Culliford's views were sought for the first time in June 2005 when the investigation into the deaths of the three deceased was under review. Her report of that date was doubtless included in the brief of evidence that was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in November 2005 in support of the ex officio indictment which was filed in February 2006. While it is reasonable to assume that Dr Cala's report and his evidence at the inquest, together with Dr Lawrence's post-mortem report and the materials prepared for the inquest, were also included in the brief of evidence, there is no evidence one way or the other as to whether Professor Cordner's report or his evidence at the inquest were brought to the Director's attention. 

268Dr Culliford was asked in June 2005 to review the forensic evidence and, in particular, to report upon whether the injuries sustained by the three deceased were likely to have been caused by one perpetrator rather than two. (The very issue that the trial judge ultimately determined was not a matter for expert opinion.) She was provided with copies of the post-mortem reports, photographs of the crime scene, and photographs of the post-mortem examination. The relevant extracts from Dr Culliford's statement dated June 2005 are as follows:

""iii. Number of wounds 
...

The fact that multiple stab wounds to the chest was chosen to murder all three victims would tend to favour one perpetrator being involved in all three assaults rather than two. However, stabbing to the chest is a common site for unlawful wounding and homicidal stabbing, but multiple stabbing is much less common.

...

iv. Position and grouping of wounds on the body 

The positions and grouping of the wounds showed significant similarities to each other. All three victims had both anterior and posterior wounds. It is possible that initial single stab wounds were made from a different position to disable the victim before the grouped stab wounds causing potentially more serious damage occurred in a different position. For instance, Christopher may have been stabbed in the back while being chased down the stairs to the games room but the main group of stab wounds occurred later when he was collapsed on the floor. 

...

4. Possible scenario in each assault

...

Doctors CALA, LAWRENCE and OETTLE (Coronial report, item 3, pp 3 and 4) all acknowledged the similarity of the wound patterns. [ It would appear she was not provided with Professor Cordner's report.] Dr CALA [sic Dr LAWRENCE] prepared an overlay for the coroner's court and illustrated the similar patterns. I agree with these opinions. The similarity of the grouped wounds was such that I cannot believe that the violent acts required to stab three people virtually the same number of times in such a similar manner could be perpetrated by two different people. The similarities must strongly suggest that there was a single perpetrator who inflicted those wounds."" (Emphasis added)

269Dr Culliford's report was served on the defence in advance of the trial. It would seem that Dr Cala's report dated July 1999 was also served and that Professor Cordner's report, together with his evidence at the inquest, was either served or disclosed. 

270The applicant's solicitors were notified by letter of the Crown's decision not to call Professor Cordner in January 2008 because he was, in the Crown's assessment, a witness who was ""plainly unreliable"". Extracts of the letter are set out at [395]. Although the letter was signed by the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions, we proceed on the assumption that the decision not to call Professor Cordner was made by the then Crown Prosecutor with or without the concurrence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

Dr Cala's evidence on the voir dire at the first trial

271Dr Cala's evidence was taken on the voir dire prior to Dr Oettle, Dr Culliford and Professor Cordner giving evidence on the voir dire concurrently later in the trial.

272At the commencement of the voir dire into the admissibility of Dr Cala's evidence, the prosecutor disclaimed any reliance on his view, reported in his July 1999 statement (extracted at [264]-[265] above) and repeated in his evidence before the Coroner, as to the likelihood of there being only one perpetrator because of similarity in the way the wounds were inflicted or their number. Despite this disclaimer, when the admissibility of Dr Culliford's evidence concerning the similarity in the pattern of wounds was raised, and the further voir dire was convened, which attracted a final ruling on the admissibility of the similarity evidence, the prosecutor claimed an entitlement to rely upon the expert opinion of Dr Culliford as going to this very issue. The reason why the Crown abandoned reliance on Dr Cala's conclusions but later pressed for admission of the same conclusion from Dr Culliford is not clear.

273Dr Cala's qualifications include a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery from the University of New South Wales (1982). After working in various public hospitals he commenced training in pathology in 1998 and took up the position of Forensic Pathology Registrar at the New South Wales Institute of Forensic Medicine at Glebe in 1994. In 1995 he worked at the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow as a forensic pathology fellow undertaking postgraduate studies. He returned to Australia in 1996 and was appointed a staff specialist at Glebe, where he remained until 2002.

274Dr Cala's evidence can be summarised as follows:

(a) After accessing the autopsy reports prepared by Dr Lawrence, including his descriptions of the type of wounds, the location of the wounds, the depths of the wounds and the angle of the wounds, and photographs taken during the post-mortem examinations, it was his view that the pattern of injuries on each of the three victims was ""very similar"". It is of some significance that this is the first reference in the evidence to there being a ""pattern of injuries"" - a concept Dr Cala used in his report dated July 1999.

(b) He identified the similarities in the pattern as including:

i. the fact that the majority of the injuries (and those that were relevant for the purposes of comparison) were to the upper chest region on the front of the body in the case of Christopher and Mr Gilham, and to the back of the body in the case of Mrs Gilham;

ii. the fact that the injuries were to vital organs including the heart and lungs and the vessels that radiate from them; and

iii. the depths of the wounds, in that they all penetrated into the body to a depth of at least 150mm.

(NB: For reasons which are not apparent, on the voir dire Dr Cala did not refer to the number of wounds inflicted on each of the deceased as a feature of similarity. Although he made specific reference to the number of wounds to each of the deceased exceeding ten in his evidence at the inquest, and although the Crown tendered his evidence of the inquest on the voir dire, neither counsel made any reference to it in submissions. By the time of the second trial the number of stab wounds featured prominently in Dr Cala's evidence, which was given considerable emphasis by the Crown Prosecutor in her closing address. In the context of considering Ground 18, and the evidence led on the appeal from Professor Cordner, the relevance (or irrelevance) of the number of stab wounds is discussed. Professor Cordner's evidence at the inquest was not tendered by the Crown or the defence on the voir dire and was not made available for the purposes of the appeal.)

(c) In cross-examination Dr Cala accepted that in concluding that the pattern of wounds is ""very similar in each of the deceased"" he disregarded features of the wounds which were dissimilar. He also conceded that he was only referring to similarities in the pattern of wounds to the upper torso, as there were significant differences in the wounds to other parts of the bodies of the deceased.

(d) He accepted there were dissimilarities in the angle of entry of the wounds. The wounds to the back of Mrs Gilham's body had been inflicted in a downward direction and the wounds to the front of the chests of Mr Gilham and Christopher were predominantly horizontal. The length or depth of the wound tracks were also variable, with only some of the wounds being of similar depth in the sense that they could be described as ""alike"".

(e) Dr Cala conceded that, irrespective of the strength of the person wielding the knife or the person's state of mind, if two people use the same sharp knife to fatally stab a person, he would expect the wounds to be similar.

Dr Lawrence's evidence at the first trial concerning the similarity in the grouping of stab wounds

275After leading evidence before the jury from Dr Lawrence concerning the location, grouping and alignment of the stab wounds he had marked on the transparencies, the Crown Prosecutor asked the following question without objection:

""Q. Doctor, what do you say about [the] comparison of the grouped stab wounds to these three victims.
A. I think they're similar.""

276Dr Lawrence was then asked whether he had been made aware of any other cases of multiple stabbings. Counsel for the applicant objected to that question, which was not answered. The further voir dire was then convened to resolve whether the Crown would be permitted to call evidence from Dr Culliford (and at that time Dr Oettle) confirming Dr Lawrence's opinion that the grouped stab wounds were similar. Dr Culliford gave evidence on the voir dire concurrently with Professor Cordner. Professor Cordner was called by the defence, no doubt as a consequence of the Crown's advice that they did not intend to call him as a witness because of his so-called ""unreliability"". (Dr Oettle also gave evidence for the Crown on the voir dire. However, because the Crown later abandoned any reliance upon his evidence, and because he was not called in either trial, his evidence will not be further referred to.) 

277The voir dire was also used to resolve the challenge to the admissibility of evidence from both witnesses in connection with blood on the knife and blood on the applicant, which are the subject of Grounds 6 and 7 of the appeal.

Dr Culliford's evidence on the voir dire at the first trial 

278Dr Culliford holds a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery with Honours and was made a member of the Royal College of Physicians of the United Kingdom in 1974 after postgraduate medical training. She holds a Masters Degree in Forensic Medicine from Monash University and has undertaken a Master of Science (Crime Scene) course at Griffith University (2002). She said she had been involved in forensic medicine as a forensic medical officer since 1987. She described her work as a forensic medical officer in a number of ways. It involved attendance at crime scenes and working with police and police scientists. She made it clear that she did not perform autopsies although, with her expertise in toxicology and injury interpretation, she worked in cooperation with the pathologist at post-mortems. She also attended to live victims of crime and persons accused of committing offences to obtain forensic samples for the purposes of a prosecution. As at the date of her statement in 2005 she was a senior forensic medical officer in the Clinical Forensic Medical Unit in Brisbane. At the time of giving her evidence on the voir dire in February 2008 she had retired due to ill health.

279She said her only previous experience of multiple stab wounds inflicted on a number of victims in the one incident was where there was no issue that all wounds had been inflicted by the same perpetrator. In one case a father had stabbed his children and his wife and in the other case a sibling had stabbed a brother and a parent. When asked about the degree of similarity in the stab wounds inflicted in those two cases as compared to the similarity in stab wounds sustained by the deceased in this case, she said that there was considerable variation in the appearance and spread of the stab wounds in both previous cases. In the first case this was due to the relative difference in the size of the father and the children, and in the second because the brother was not disabled very quickly. In effect, her exposure to these stabbing events did not provide any basis for comparison with the deaths of Mr and Mrs Gilham and Christopher. She was not cross-examined on this aspect of her evidence.

280Dr Culliford said that the close grouping of between 15 and 17 stab wounds centralised in one area on the upper body of each of the deceased showed ""an extraordinary degree of similarity"", which may lead to a conclusion as to the number of perpetrators. This was a departure from her statement (reproduced at [268]) where she expressed her view as to the likelihood of there being one perpetrator in categorical terms. Ultimately, however, she deferred to what she recognised as the superior academic and professional credentials of Professor Cordner and accepted that despite what she maintained was a ""marked degree of similarity in the grouping of the wounds"", in the absence of any body of research into stab wound patterns, care should be taken before drawing a conclusion as to the number of perpetrators involved in inflicting the injuries. She expressed reluctance in drawing that conclusion. As to the significance of a pattern in the appearance of the wounds, she said:

""Certainly I took this to a grand round up in Queensland of experts in the John Tom Centre. I took it to other experts to say that there was a lack of body of evidence to determine whether you could link patterns of stab wounds with one perpetrator.

Professor Cordner is absolutely correct that there is no body of evidence stating that you can necessarily link it, but we throughout, in forensic medicine, when you're talking about injury interpretation, talk persistently about patterns of injuries, and from determining patterns of injuries you draw conclusions. I had this rammed into me when I did my masters degree, and, certainly since, that patterns of injuries lead you to make conclusions.

There are patterns of injury here that have great similarity. There are differences, but there are some great similarities. I think we have to think why there are those similarities.

Although I agree with some of what my learned colleagues have been saying, I have to, even though Professor Cordner is a very experienced and very long-standing revered pathology professor, he would have a lot more experience in hands on, when it comes down to interpreting patterns, I have read extensively about research that has occurred in the States. The States seemed to have managed to collect an awful lot of data that we don't have here. They have started to look at patterns of injuries. There are no set databases, but there are more conclusions saying that there are certain patterns that can be attributed to the nature of what happened. Whether it can be drawn to conclusions we are trying to reach here, I do not know, and I believe that Professor Cordner is correct in having doubts, but I still believe that the similarities still have to be explained. I think there are more similarities than dissimilarities, and I think that needs to be explained.""

281She adhered to the view that the grouped wounds on the chests of Mr Gilham and Christopher, and the grouped wounds on Mrs Gilham's back, were ""remarkably similar"" or ""extraordinarily similar"" - similarities which to her mind outweighed the dissimilarities. When she was asked against what data or index she assessed the similarities as ""remarkable"" or ""extraordinary"", she said her conclusion derived from a comparison of each group of wounds to the other two:

""... What I have tried to do in my statement is try and nut out the injuries that occurred around the disabling process and the injuries that occurred while the victim was still alert and awake and able to defend themselves or try and defend themselves and then the grouped injuries that appeared to occur during a process when almost certainly the victim was disabled and perhaps unconscious or even dead, and it's those groupings at that time which are similar. The numbers are similar and the grouping over a small area is similar. But whether or not I would be prepared to draw a conclusion from that, as I have said, because there is no body of evidence, I think we have to take care with drawing a conclusion even though they are extremely similar.""

282When she was asked by defence counsel what methodology she used in concluding that the pattern or grouping of injuries was ""extraordinarily similar"" as between each deceased (other than by reading Dr Lawrence's autopsy reports and reviewing his diagrams), she said:

""DR CULLIFORD. Yes, and I drew up my own diagrams too, but yes, I looked at the information that I was given.

Q. You were in the same position as the jury are in now, isn't that right? Have you used any particular technique or enhancement procedures to help you reach the same conclusion?
A. I looked at the dimensions. The directions, the positions of the injuries and then logged it - I drew it up on paper myself to look at how these things were similar. For instance, in some of the groupings, they seemed to be in a similar direction, which implicates (sic) that they occurred at a similar time, that is, one after the other. As his Honour says, I am not drawing any specific conclusion as to the significance of that similarity. What I am saying is I have looked at all the descriptions in the pathology very carefully. I spent weeks over my initial deliberation over this to look at the similarity or otherwise of these injuries, and I felt that there were groupings that were similar. However, drawing a conclusion myself as to, especially since it is lacking a specific body of evidence to confirm this, I am not so sure that I, as a forensic clinician, can in fact draw a conclusion as to whether it was one or two perpetrators.""

Professor Cordner's evidence on the voir dire at the first trial

283At the time of giving evidence Professor Cordner was Director of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine and a Professor of Forensic Medicine at Monash University. He gave evidence by reference to statistical data that over the previous 20 years homicide by stabbing was the most common form of homicide in Australia and that the infliction of large numbers of stab wounds (14, 16, 19 stab wounds or more) is not uncommon. He confirmed that there was no literature or science comparing patterns of wounds other than references in the literature to signature injuries (the so-called ""Mark of Zorro"" injuries) or distinctive patterns of mutilation inflicted by mentally disturbed or psychotic offenders. He said that there was no database kept in Australia or overseas relating to patterns of wounds caused by knives. He went on to say:

""I am not aware of any work in the literature that has correlated the similarity of the number and distribution of stab wounds or injuries of any kind between multiple victims in one event and the number of possible assailants. 

...I do not believe there is an area of expertise that enables a person to say that injuries are similar as between numbers of victims to allow a conclusion that there may be one or more assailants.""

284The trial judge then said:

""...I don't care what this witness' opinion is on that matter [the conclusion as to the number of assailants] at the present time. I am simply asking whether [Dr Culliford] has sufficient expertise to say whether these injuries are similar full stop, nothing more. All I seem to be getting is something about the information or the learning or the expertise to draw some conclusion about that. That's a separate question. Are you suggesting that Dr Culliford cannot, as a matter of expertise, tell me that these injuries or these wounds are similar? Is that what you're saying, professor?

Professor Cordner. ...Leave aside what is done with the conclusion, then I think you can draw - you can say that particular injuries on one deceased are similar to particular injuries on another deceased.""

285Professor Cordner gave evidence that he did not regard it as significant that the heart and lungs of each of the deceased were penetrated by stab wounds. He preferred to focus on the fact that the wounds were delivered to the back of one of the deceased (Mrs Gilham) and to the front of the other two deceased as important in determining the position of the deceased relative to the assailant when they were killed. As it was common ground that the same knife was used to inflict all wounds, he was of the view that this would inevitably result in a predictable level of similarity in the wounds that were inflicted and that he would give ""no weight"" to their number or distribution as constituting a pattern. He also considered that the dissimilarities in the number and distribution of the wounds were significant.

The submissions on the voir dire 

286Defence counsel submitted that whilst it was Dr Lawrence's evidence that he saw what he described as ""a similarity"" in the grouped wounds sustained by each of the deceased when using the transparencies as overlays (a submission from which it must be assumed that there was no objection to Dr Lawrence giving evidence of what he observed), it did not follow that the Crown should be permitted to call evidence from Dr Culliford and Dr Cala that they agreed with Dr Lawrence's observation and to give their opinion as to the extent of the similarity.

287In the course of submissions defence counsel also made it clear that it was not the applicant's intention to cal",2012-06-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759565,R v Fadi Shamoun [2012] NSWSC 716,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION
1On 28 March 2012, following a trial which commenced on 7 February 2012, Fadi Shamoun (""the offender"") was found guilty by a jury of the following:

(1)that on 24 June 2007, at Castle Hill in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Richard Carruthers;

(2)that on 24 June 2007, at Castle Hill in the State of New South Wales, he did maliciously wound Phuong Carruthers.

2The offender was convicted of both counts on 28 March 2012 and the matter is now before me for sentence. The jury could not agree in relation to a number of counts against a co-offender with whom the offender stood trial.

3The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment (see Crimes Act 1900 s 19A). Pursuant to s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") a standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed for that offence. 

4Section 61(1) of the Sentencing Act mandates the imposition of a life sentence if I am satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. The Crown did not suggest that the present offence fell into this category, and I am satisfied that it does not. Accordingly, a life sentence is not warranted. 

5In determining the appropriate sentence, I am not required to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, nor am I required to proceed to an assessment of whether or not the offence is within the mid range of objective seriousness (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]). The relevant statutory provisions, and in particular ss.54B(2), 54B(3) and 21A of the Sentencing Act, require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified, and a judgment reached as to the appropriate sentence, having regard to all such factors (see Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]). 

6The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the 'non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness'. It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27]; [31]). 

7In the course of the sentence proceedings I received a Victim Impact Statement from each of the deceased's parents, as well as from his wife, his brother and his sister. Each statement was read to the court, and each set out the effect and impact of the deceased's death upon the members of his immediate family. Unsurprisingly, the members of the deceased's family were, and remain, shocked, distressed and grief stricken, not only by the fact of the deceased's death, but also by the circumstances in which it occurred. It is to be hoped that each of them has gained some assistance in coping with their grief by being given the opportunity to express their feelings to the court through their statements. That said, in light of the provisions of s 28(4)(b) of the Sentencing Act, it is not appropriate that I consider the contents of those statements in connection with the determination of the appropriate sentence (see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510).

8At the commencement of the sentence proceedings, the Crown made an application for an adjournment. Having heard argument on that issue, I refused the application and indicated that I would give reasons for my decision at the time of passing sentence. 

9Prior to the commencement of the trial, the Crown served a notice pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 seeking the admission, in its case against the offender at trial, of evidence concerning an incident at Kings Cross approximately two weeks after the murder of the deceased (""the Kings Cross incident""). The Crown's application was later expanded to include an application that the evidence be admitted pursuant to s. 98 of the Evidence Act. In a judgment delivered on 16 February 2012, I concluded that the evidence should not be admitted. 

10It is not necessary for me to canvass the facts of the Kings Cross incident in any detail. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to note that it is alleged by the Crown that the offender wounded a member of the public with a knife. It is further alleged that on that occasion he was in the company of a person to whom I shall refer, in accordance with orders I made at the commencement of the offender's trial, as David Saad (""Saad""). Saad was a principal witness for the Crown against the offender, having originally been charged with the deceased's murder, before being indemnified.

11The Crown Prosecutor informed me that the offender has now been indicted in the District Court in respect of the Kings Cross incident and that his trial is to commence in October 2012. He submitted that the sentence proceedings in the present matter should not be concluded until such time as that trial was completed because:

a.there were similarities between the two incidents;
b.in the event that the current sentence proceedings were finalised, and the offender was convicted of an offence arising out of the Kings Cross incident at his forthcoming trial, I would be precluded from taking into account ""very important material impacting on the protection of the community""; and 
c.a conviction in respect of the Kings Cross incident would, in particular, provide me with ""additional and important material as to the level of dangerousness of the offender"". 

12As to the first of those matters, I simply note that in my earlier judgment I determined (at [40]) that the only real similarity between the two incidents was that on the Crown case in respect of each, the offender had used a knife. 

13Mr Stratton SC who appeared for the offender opposed the Crown's application and submitted:

a.that the offender was entitled to know the outcome of the present matter at the earliest possible time, in circumstances where the trial had concluded some months ago; and

b.that whilst he accepted that an offender's past criminal history was a relevant consideration in relation to sentence, if the Crown's application was successful, and if the offender was convicted at his forthcoming trial, I would be asked to take into account, in sentencing him for the present offences, an aspect of his criminal history which arose after such offences were committed. This, he submitted, would give rise to a risk of the offender being exposed to what he described as a ""doubling effect"" in respect of the use of his criminal history. 

14Having heard the competing submissions, I concluded that, for a number of reasons, the Crown's application should be refused. 

15The offences of which the offender was found guilty by the jury occurred more than five years ago. The verdicts were returned three months ago. In my view, there was some merit in Mr Stratton's submission that the offender is entitled to know his position without any further delay. 

16In terms of the submission made by Mr Stratton as to the offender being exposed to a possible ""doubling effect"" in respect of the use of his criminal history I have had regard to the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v MAK; R v MSK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [50] - [61]. The fact that a conviction in respect of the Kings Cross incident would be a conviction in respect of an offence which took place after the commission of the present offences may still bear upon the question of an appropriate sentence. However, the fact is that at the present time, the offender has not been convicted of such an offence and for the reasons set out, I take the view that he is entitled to know the outcome of the present matters without any further delay. I should also say that although the offender's alleged actions in the Kings Cross incident would, if proved, be regarded as serious, they are of less gravity than his actions in murdering the deceased, and wounding the deceased's wife. 

17Finally, and bearing in mind the basis on which the Crown put its application, there is evidence before me which deals with the issues of the offender's level of dangerousness and his risk to the community. Dr Furst gave evidence in the sentence proceedings and it was clear from that evidence that in forming his opinions as to those issues, he had regard to the Kings Cross incident in any event.

18It was for these reasons that I took the view that the Crown's application should be refused, and that the matter should proceed.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDING
19For the purposes of determining an appropriate sentence, I am required to make findings of fact in relation to the circumstances of the offending. Any factual findings I make must be consistent with the jury's verdicts. In particular, I must accept such facts as are established by those verdicts, and I must not determine any factual issue in a way which is inconsistent with them (see R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374). The Crown bears the onus of satisfying me, beyond reasonable doubt, of any finding of fact against the offender. The offender bears the onus of proving factual matters in mitigation, on the balance of probabilities. 

20There are two particular factual issues which emerged in the course of hearing evidence and submissions on sentence. Leaving aside those issues, which are more fully dealt with later in this judgment, I find the circumstances of the offending to be as I have set out below. In reaching those findings it has been necessary, in order to put the offender's conduct in context, to make some brief references to the Crown case against the co-offender. However, I make no findings in respect of the co-offender's alleged conduct. 

21At the time of his death in June 2007 the deceased lived with his wife at Castle Hill. He operated a business known as ""Water Features Australia"" which specialised in the installation and maintenance of water features of various kinds, including fountains and ponds.

22It was not in dispute that the deceased had once worked for the co-offender, and that he had left his employment in acrimonious circumstances before setting up a business which was in some ways similar to, and thus partly in competition with, that conducted by the co-offender. The Crown case was that the co-offender, motivated by the circumstances in which his association with the deceased had previously ended, wanted the deceased harmed. The Crown alleged that the co-offender was introduced to Saad through two third parties, Andrew Maatouk (""Maatouk"") and Robert Wakim (""Wakim"") and that he (the co-offender) requested Saad to assist him in having the deceased harmed. The Crown alleged that, in turn, Saad had enlisted the assistance of the offender to help carry out the co-offender's request. 

23In the early hours of Sunday 24 June 2007, the offender travelled with Saad, in Saad's vehicle, to Castle Hill. The offender and Saad were the only two persons present in the vehicle at that time. 

24At about 3:50am, having arrived in the vicinity of the deceased's premises, the offender got out of Saad's vehicle. Saad remained in the driver's seat. The offender then approached the deceased's premises and entered them. He was on his own, and he forced entry through a rear door, breaking a lock and chain which were attached to it. He was in possession of a knife at the time. 

25The offender's attendance at, and entry into, the deceased's premises on the morning of 24 June 2007 had come about as a result of the circumstances I have previously described. It was not the Crown case that Saad had requested that the offender kill the deceased, nor was it suggested by the Crown that the original request of the co-offender to Saad was couched in that way. However, the evidence as to the precise terms of the request varied somewhat. There were references in the evidence to a request that the deceased be ""taught a lesson"", that he be ""bashed"", that he be ""scared"", and that he be ""hurt"". In the course of submissions the term ""rough up"" was also used. The evidence does not enable me to make a finding as to the precise terms of the request which was made. However, I find that such request was one that the deceased be injured in some serious and significant way. 

26Shortly after the offender entered the deceased's premises, the deceased and his wife awoke, having heard a noise inside the house. Whilst the house was still in darkness, the offender appeared at the door of the deceased's bedroom. He entered the bedroom and came to the side of the bed on which the deceased had been sleeping. The deceased's wife gave evidence, which I unreservedly accept, that the offender then began ""beating"" on the deceased's body and ""bashing"" him. The deceased's wife did not assert that the offender used a knife at that stage. However, I find that the offender's attack upon the deceased was unprovoked, and that the deceased was unarmed. The deceased's wife did not hear the offender say anything at the time. She agreed that the offender did not ask for money, and that nothing was taken from the premises. 

27The deceased's wife fled from the bedroom and out into the street. I am satisfied that in the course of doing so, she suffered a laceration to her right wrist, that being the injury relied upon by the Crown in respect of the count of malicious wounding of which the offender was also found guilty. Although she gave evidence about sustaining a fracture of the ankle as she fled the house, no aspect of that injury was relied upon by the Crown in support of the count of malicious wounding. 

28The evidence does not permit me to make any finding as to precisely how the deceased's wife sustained the injury to her wrist. She herself gave no evidence about the injury and a police officer who attended the scene could not recall it. The evidence was limited to that of an ambulance officer who recalled treating the injury at the scene. He gave no evidence of the precise nature or severity of the injury, other than to say that he had some recollection of there being blood. Accordingly, although the circumstances in which it was sustained were obviously traumatic, I find that the injury itself was relatively minor. There is no suggestion that it was inflicted with the knife of which the offender was in possession. 

29Following his attack upon the deceased, the offender fled the premises and ran back to Saad's vehicle. Saad had remained in the driver's seat. Saad and the offender drove away from the area. Saad's vehicle was subsequently photographed by speed cameras in the nearby vicinity, at a time which was generally consistent with the time at which the deceased was attacked. 

30Police and ambulance officers were called to the scene. The police found the deceased the lying on the floor of the bedroom. He had no signs of life at the time of their arrival, and this was confirmed a short time after by an ambulance officer. An examination of the inside of the premises revealed, amongst other things, a large amount of blood spatter on the walls, from which it was evident that a violent struggle had taken place between the offender and the deceased during the final moments of the deceased's life. I find that it was in the course of that struggle that the deceased sustained, as a result of the actions of the offender, a fatal wound some 13 cm deep, inflicted by the penetration of a knife through his back, which severed his pulmonary artery. The deceased's death resulted from the combination of a loss of blood and an associated collapse of his lung. 

31The fatal wound was not the only wound suffered by the deceased in the course of the struggle with the offender. Dr Langlois, a Forensic Pathologist who gave evidence at the trial, detected a fracture of the deceased's fifth rib although he was not able to determine precisely how that was caused, other than to say that it was the result of some blunt force. I do find, however, that such injury was sustained in the course of the struggle to which I previously referred. 

32There were other injuries sustained by the deceased in that struggle. Dr Langlois referred to some as being in the nature of a ""cutting injury"" (which he described as an injury which was greater in length than depth, and which was caused by a cutting or slashing type action) and others as being in the nature of a ""stabbing injury"" (which he described as an injury, the depth of which was greater than its length, and which was caused by a thrusting action). In addition to those injuries, grazes, bruising, abrasions and scratches were found upon the body of the deceased. 
33Saad gave evidence that prior to his attendance with the offender at the deceased's premises in the early hours of 24 June 2007, he had gone there on three previous occasions. He said that on the first occasion he was on his own, and that on the third occasion he was ""on his own probably"". 

34However, he gave evidence that on the second occasion on which he attended the deceased's premises prior to the murder the offender was with him, for the purpose of being able to identify the deceased's premises. He said that on this occasion, they were seated in his vehicle which was parked near the deceased's premises, and they left the area when another vehicle entered premises a short distance away. Two neighbours who returned to their home in their vehicle at approximately 10.30 pm on the night before the deceased's death each gave evidence of seeing a vehicle parked nearby when they arrived home. This leads me to conclude that it was Saad's vehicle that they observed on that evening. However, neither gave evidence of seeing two people in the vehicle at the time. Their evidence provides little or no support for Saad's assertion that the offender was present with him on that occasion. I am not satisfied that he was present at that time.

35In terms of the offence of murder the following are aggravating factors pursuant to the Sentencing Act: 

a. the offence involved the actual use of a weapon (s. 21A(2)(c));
b.it was committed in the home of the deceased (s. 21A(2)(eb));
c.it was part of a planned or organised criminal activity (s. 21A(2)(n)) in the sense that there was a plan to harm the deceased, albeit not a plan to murder him. 

36The commission of the offence of malicious wounding did not involve the use of a weapon, nor did it involve any degree of planning. However, it was committed in the home shared by the deceased's wife which is an aggravating factor pursuant to s. 21A(2)(eb).

37On any view, the deceased's murder resulted from an attack upon him which was unprovoked and violent, which involved the use of a weapon, and which was committed within his home following a forced entry by the offender who was in possession of a knife. Given the time of the day at which the offence was committed, the offender must have realised the likelihood that the deceased would be asleep when he entered the premises, that he would therefore be taken by surprise, and that he would be unarmed. Members of the community are entitled to expect that within the confines of their own home, they will be safe from such attacks, particularly when they are perpetrated by persons with whom they are not even remotely acquainted, and whose intention is to do them serious harm. 

FACTUAL ISSUES
38In the course of the submissions on sentence two principal factual issues emerged, namely: 

(1)whether the offender intended to kill the deceased, or whether he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm; and

(2)whether the offender murdered the deceased for financial reward. 

THE OFFENDER'S INTENTION
39The Crown case on the murder count was based upon an intention to kill the deceased, or alternatively an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. Even though the Crown did not allege that in enlisting the assistance of the offender Saad had requested that the deceased be killed, the Crown submitted that I would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that by the time the offender fatally stabbed the deceased, he had formed an intention to kill him. 

40In support of this submission, the Crown argued that it was evident from the jury's verdict that they had accepted the evidence that:

a.Saad and the offender had gone to Castle Hill in the early hours of 24 June 2007;
b.the offender had entered the deceased's premises;
c.he had entered those premises on his own; 
d.he was in possession of a knife which was later used to fatally attack the deceased; and
e.the deceased had sustained multiple injuries, including ""many stabs"". 

41In response, Mr Stratton submitted that:

a.on the Crown's own case, there was no request to kill the deceased, but a request to inflict grievous bodily harm;
b.the attack upon, and death of, the deceased occurred in darkness, following a struggle; and
c.the darkness was significant because it tended against a finding that there were direct and aimed blows by the offender, with a knife, in conditions of clear visibility.

42Mr Stratton conceded that there was evidence upon which I could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. He submitted that such a finding would be consistent with the jury's verdict in view of the alternative bases on which the Crown put the case to the jury. 

43In my view, the principal matters relied upon by the Crown in support of its submission that the offender formed an intention to kill are equally consistent with an intention on the part of the offender to inflict grievous bodily harm. The fact that the offender went to Castle Hill, that he entered the deceased's house, that he did so on his own and that he was in possession of a knife are not, particularly in view of the Crown case as to the terms of the original request by Saad, matters which specifically point to the offender having formed an intention to kill. 

44I have carefully considered the evidence of Dr Langlois. It is self evident that one particular injury sustained by the deceased was fatal. Others, whilst not fatal, were obviously serious, some more so than others. The injuries are certainly consistent with a struggle having taken place between the offender and the deceased. However, I am not satisfied that those injuries, either of themselves or in combination with the other matters relied upon by the Crown, establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offender formed an intention to kill the deceased. 

45Similarly, the fact that a violent struggle obviously took place is not something which, in my view, points specifically in favour of a conclusion that the offender had formed an intention to kill. This is particularly so when the struggle took place in darkness and where there is no evidence of, as Mr Stratton put it, ""aimed blows in conditions of visibility"". 

46Accordingly, I find that at the time of the murder, the offender did not intend to kill the deceased, but intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. 

Did the offender commit the murder for reward?
47According to Saad, the offender agreed to become involved when first approached, and said to Saad words to the effect ""give (him) a price and we'll do it"". Saad gave evidence that he subsequently gave a figure to Maatouk of what he (Saad) wanted to be paid. Saad initially gave evidence that he could not recall the exact amount he had stipulated, but that it ""probably would have been over 50"", a reference to a sum of $50,000.00. He subsequently gave evidence that Maatouk had reverted to him at some later stage and told him that he (Maatouk) would pay ""around 30 thousand"". When cross examined, Saad agreed that in the course of his statements to the police, and his evidence at a committal hearing, he had made no reference to a figure of $50,000.00, and that the first mention of this figure was in his evidence in chief at the trial.

48Saad also gave evidence that following the deceased's murder, he spoke with Maatouk about the question of payment and that two or three days after the murder he and Maatouk met at Milperra, at which time he was given a paper bag by Maatouk containing ""about 15 grand"". That, according to Saad, was the offender's share of the payment, which he said he delivered to the offender on the same day at a building site in Parramatta. Some of this evidence was not consistent with what Saad had previously said to others. In particular, he had told police that he received an amount of money two weeks after the deceased's murder (as opposed to 2 or 3 days), and that the amount given to him on that occasion was between $15,000.00 and $20,000.00. 

49Maatouk gave evidence that he had handed Saad an amount of $30,000.00 at Milperra, not in a paper bag but in a cardboard cylinder. When asked whether or not the amount of money could have been considerably less, and closer to a sum of $15,000.00, Maatouk firstly said he did not know and then said he was not sure. Wakim gave evidence that he had given the money to Maatouk and that the amount was in fact $40,000.00. 

50The offender's former employer gave evidence that he recalled an occasion between January and March of 2007 (some months prior to the murder) on which he saw Saad at a building site in Parramatta where the offender was working at the time. His evidence was that he did not see Saad hand the offender a package on that occasion. 

51The Crown accepted that the payment of money to the offender was not an element of the offence of murder, and was therefore not a finding which the jury must necessarily have reached in order to return the verdict of guilty. Nevertheless, the Crown submitted I should find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender committed the offence of murder for reward. Such a conclusion, the Crown submitted, was a matter of common sense. 

52The Crown also submitted that payment for the crime was an important part of the case against the offender, such that it would follow, in light of the jury's verdict, that the jury must have accepted Saad's evidence in relation to it. As to the inconsistencies in the evidence, the Crown went so far as to say that he was ""not suggesting for one minute"" that the evidence of Wakim and Maatouk on the subject of payment ""was satisfactory evidence"". As to that submission, I need only observe that evidence which is accepted by the Crown as being unsatisfactory is hardly a sound basis, even in part, upon which to reach a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. 

53The Crown did not urge that I should find that this was a contract killing in the sense of one person having agreed, for money, to kill another. He acknowledged that this was not established by the evidence, nor was it the Crown case. However, the Crown submitted that if I was to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did receive payment, the circumstances were not substantially removed from those of a contract killing. Offences of that kind, he submitted, had consistently been regarded as falling within the upper range of objective seriousness. 

54Mr Stratton submitted that the evidence did not support a finding that the offender acted for reward. He relied on the fact that Saad's evidence was contradicted not only by the evidence of other witnesses, but also by his own previous statements to police. He submitted that apart from Saad, there was no evidence of money being handed to the offender. He also pointed specifically to the fact there was no objective evidence, such as bank deposits or the offender otherwise being in possession of large amounts of cash, which might support the proposition that he was paid money. 
55Mr Stratton's submission was that the more likely scenario was that Saad had taken advantage of the offender's limited intelligence to have him do what he, Saad, was in fact being paid to do. He submitted that the fact that the original request was to ""rough up"", or hurt, the deceased, made it more likely that the offender was not expecting to be paid for it. Mr Stratton also submitted that the relevant ""hierarchy"" as between Saad and the offender, was such that Saad was responsible for directing matters. This, he submitted, further supported a finding that Saad took advantage of the offender. 

56The verdicts of the jury necessarily mean that despite the attack upon Saad's credit, his evidence as to the events of the early morning of 24 June 2007 was accepted. However, the Crown has acknowledged that the payment of money to the offender was not an element of the offence of murder. Accordingly, a finding that the offender was paid money was not a finding which was essential to the jury's verdict of guilty on that count. 

57Some aspects of Saad's evidence on the topic of money were vague and imprecise; other aspects were inconsistent with what he had told the police; yet other aspects were inconsistent with the evidence of other Crown witnesses. On the whole, I found Saad's evidence on the topic of payment of money to be most unsatisfactory. 

58The Crown's submission that I should find that the offender acted for reward because payment for the crime was an important part of the case against him must be assessed having regard to the conduct of the case as a whole. The Crown opened to the jury on the basis that the offender's motive was the payment of money. However, the Crown Prosecutor's final address to the jury, although it contained reference to the evidence as to payment, was bereft of any reference to the suggestion that the offender was motivated by money. That circumstance does not sit entirely comfortably with the submission that the issue of payment to the offender formed an important part of the Crown case. 

59Further, the fact that the jury obviously accepted important parts of Saad's evidence does not mean that they accepted his evidence in its entirety. Specifically, the fact that the jury concluded that the offender murdered the deceased does not lead to the conclusion that they also found that he was paid for so doing. Whilst I accept the Crown's submission that it is not open to a sentencing judge to make findings of fact contrary to the verdict of the jury, a conclusion that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was paid would not, in my view, be one which was inconsistent with the jury's verdict. 

60For these reasons, and whilst there is obviously considerable suspicion attaching to this issue, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender, in killing the deceased, did so for reward. However, I am equally not satisfied on balance, as Mr Stratton urged, that the more likely scenario was that the offender had been prevailed upon by Saad who, in effect, took advantage of the offender's limited intelligence. To reach such a conclusion would involve an impermissible degree of speculation. 

61Accordingly, the evidence simply does not enable me to make a specific finding in relation to this issue. 

THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES
62I turn then to consider the offender's subjective circumstances. The offender did not give evidence on sentence and the information as to his background which follows is extracted from the medical evidence, and in particular from the principal report of Dr Furst which was tendered in his case, and to which I have referred further below. 

63The offender is currently 29 years of age having being born on 25 February 1983. He is the third born child of his parents, and has three brothers and one sister. He was born in Iraq and fled to Jordan, and then Syria, with his family, before migrating as a refugee to Australia when he was 21 years of age. His father was forced to enter the Iraqi army and the offender recalls the army arriving at his house and ""grabbing his father"". He was upset by those events, as his father was away from the family for several years. 

64The offender left school when he was 10 or 11 years of age and appears to have had only limited education in Iraq. He did not attend school when he was living in Syria and worked as a plumber during that time. He worked in some capacity for a plumbing company after arriving in Australia. The history taken by Dr Furst from the offender was that he was unable to undertake an apprenticeship because of his poor literacy skills and the effects of a previous motorcycle accident. The offender also told Dr Furst that he had been unable to work after an accident in 2008, an event to which I have referred further below. 

65Mr Stratton tendered, without objection by the Crown, a reference from Reverend Narsai Youkhanis from the Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East. Reverend Youkhanis described the offender as being a helpful and faithful member of the Church community. He also described the offender's family as a well respected family in the Assyrian community, who played a substantial and positive role in the community's general affairs.

66The offender's criminal history is limited to a conviction in October 2006 by a Local Court for an offence of common assault for which he was fined. He therefore has no significant record of previous convictions which is a mitigating factor pursuant to s. 21A(3)(e) of the Sentencing Act. In addition, the fact that the injury caused by the offence of malicious wounding was not substantial (s. 21A(3)(a)), along with the fact that the commission of such offence was not part of a planned criminal activity (s. 21A(3)(b)) are mitigating factors in respect of that offence. 

67The offender has shown no remorse for his actions. 

68Much of the argument in respect of the offender's subjective case arose out of oral evidence given by Dr Richard Furst, along with the contents of three medical reports which were tendered in the offender's case, namely: 

(i)a report of Dr Bruce Westmore dated 16 January 2012;

(ii)a report of Dr Richard Furst dated 30 May 2012 and;

(iii)a further supplementary report of Dr Richard Furst dated 3 June 2012.

69Dr Westmore examined the offender on 16 January 2012, prior to the commencement of the trial, in order to determine the offender's fitness to plead. He obtained a history from the offender that he had suffered a head injury in a motorcycle accident, and another head injury when he had jumped from a balcony. At the time of his examination Dr Westmore had available to him a hospital discharge summary of 1 June 2008 which recorded that the offender had been diagnosed with a subdural haematoma following an earlier fall from a balcony, but that he was discharged on the same day as he presented. 

70Dr Westmore found the offender fit to plead. He also found that the offender was not suffering from a major depressive disorder, and that no psychotic symptoms were identified. He concluded that although the offender was of dull or compromised intelligence, he was not mentally retarded. He found that a previous head injury, following a fall, had left the offender with ""some traumatic brain damage"". However, he found no evidence that the offender suffered from a confusional state, and also found that the offender did not appear to be distracted or suffering major problems with attention and concentration

71Dr Furst, also a Forensic Psychiatrist, examined the offender following the jury's verdict. Dr Furst's initial report is dated 30 May 2012 and a supplementary report is dated 3 June 2012. 
72At the time of his examination of the offender Dr Furst (who had available to him the report of Dr Westmore) recorded a history, taken from the offender, that the offender was involved in a motorcycle accident in either 2005 or 2006, and that he was involved in a car accident in 2007. The history included the fact that the offender had jumped from a balcony in 2008 as a result of which he had memory problems, as well as a loss of taste and smell. Dr Furst understood that the offender had literacy problems before the accident in 2008. 

73Dr Furst concluded that the offender had evidence of cognitive impairment and reported that although he did not have results of formal neuropsychological testing available, the offender's presentation was in keeping with having a significant acquired brain injury. This, he said, had produced cognitive defects which were also significant. However, he found that the offender did not appear to be suffering from any major mental illness.

74Dr Furst's supplementary report of 3 June 2012 was the result of a request from the offender's solicitors that he address the issue of the offender's ""future dangerousness"". In this respect Dr Furst reported as follows:

""Some of his protective factors include that he does not currently present with features of a mental illness, he is no longer abusing alcohol and other drugs, he is incarcerated, and he has evidence of significant cognitive impairment, which will make it harder for him to plan and organise himself in the future. His cognitive impairments may also act as an additional protective factor, as it appears to have led to social avoidance, meaning he may be les (sic) likely to associate with pro-criminal peers in the future.

Dynamic factors that may improve over time are his attitudes, level of insight and impulsivity. His risk of future offending could also be reduced through engagement in a suitable program for his offending...Having regard to his psychiatric and social history, the offence in question, and his current mental state, I am of the opinion that his risk of future violent offending is moderate...He may well require additional support, structure and assistance when placed in the community which could lower the potential for future dangerousness.""

75In the course of his oral evidence, Dr Furst agreed that there appeared to be only one occasion on which the offender had suffered a head injury which had been treated, namely the occasion on which he had been treated at Liverpool Hospital. For the purposes of arriving at his conclusions, Dr Furst proceeded upon the assumption that this incident gave rise to the traumatic brain injury which he diagnosed. 

76Dr Furst also accepted that in order to determine the extent of any brain damage that might be suffered in such an incident, it was often the case that a neuropsychologist was engaged for the purposes of carrying out psychometric testing, but that this had not been done thus far in the case of the offender. He agreed that in order to obtain a more accurate assessment of the extent of any brain damage the offender would be required to undergo such testing. Importantly, Dr Furst also agreed that the fact the offender had been discharged on the same day as he presented to the hospital following the fall in 2008, as well as the fact that he required no intensive care treatment on that occasion, ""probably meant"" that the injury was not at the ""severe end of the spectrum"". 

77At the conclusion of the evidence, Mr Stratton was granted leave to provide a report of any neuropsychological testing in relation to the offender. No such evidence has been forthcoming, and I am therefore left to determine the issues surrounding the offender's medical condition on the basis of the evidence I have set out above.

78Mr Stratton submitted that I should conclude that the offender suffers from a traumatic brain injury. Although he did not suggest that such injury was directly relevant to the commission of the offences of which the offender was found guilty, Mr Stratton submitted that as a consequence of this injury considerations of general deterrence should be afforded less weight. As to that submission, I have had regard to the principles set out In R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 per Wood CJ at CL at 394; [253]. Mr Stratton further submitted that I should find special circumstances. 
79The Crown submitted that on the whole of the evidence, whilst it would be open to find that the offender had a brain injury, I should conclude that such injury was not of any real severity or significance. He submitted that it was important that notwithstanding the fact that Dr Westmore had diagnosed a brain injury, he had also concluded that all of the relevant criteria as to fitness to plead had been satisfied. The Crown also placed some reliance upon the concession of Dr Furst that the absence of neuropsychological testing necessarily affected the accuracy of the assessment of the extent of the offender's brain damage, as well as his concession as to the proper inferences to be drawn from the hospital discharge summary in relation to the severity of the offender's brain injury. The Crown submitted that in these circumstances, general deterrence remained a relevant consideration, and one deserving of weight. He also submitted that there was nothing which would properly constitute special circumstances.

80Given the opinions of Drs Westmore and Furst I am satisfied that the offender has a brain injury. Both specialists reached that conclusion. The real issue concerns the severity of that injury, that being an issue in respect of which the opinions of the specialists differed. Unfortunately, I do not have the benefit of any results of psychometric testing which Dr Furst agreed would be beneficial in determining such issue. 

81At the time of his examination in January of this year, Dr Westmore concluded (inter alia) that the offender did not appear to be distracted or suffering major problems with attention and concentration. Although he found that there was evidence of some traumatic brain damage, his observations as to the offender's presentation did not bespeak of a brain injury at the higher end of the scale. Consistent with these views, Dr Westmore concluded that the offender was fit to plead. Mr Stratton submitted that no inference could be drawn from that fact because the relevant criteria were applied at what he described as a ""low threshold"". I am unable to accept that submission. The fact is that less than six months ago, Dr Westmore was satisfied that the offender was able to (inter alia) understand the charge, plead to the charge, understand the nature of the proceedings, follow the course of those proceedings and understand the substantial effect of any evidence given against him (see generally R v Presser [1958] VR 45).

82Some months later Dr Furst concluded that the offender had difficulty (inter alia) maintaining attention during simple tasks. This, he concluded, was at least partly an indication of the offender having a significant acquired brain injury, which had produced similarly significant cognitive defects. Leaving aside the fact that these conclusions are at odds with Dr Westmore's opinion, I find it difficult to reconcile them with Dr Furst's concession in the course of cross examination that, based upon the contemporaneous medical evidence which is available, the injury sustained by the offender was not, as he himself put it, ""in the severe end of the spectrum"". 

83For all of these reasons, whilst I am satisfied that the offender suffers from a traumatic brain injury, I am not satisfied that its significance is as reported by Dr Furst. On the whole of the evidence, I find that the offender's brain injury is not in the severe end of the range. 

84Both Dr Westmore and Dr Furst concluded that the offender does not suffer from any mental illness. Further, on the basis of their opinions, there is no evidence that the offender suffers from any severe intellectual handicap. For the reasons I have previously expressed, I find that any cognitive deficit which has arisen as a consequence of the offender's brain injury is, commensurate with my earlier findings, not severe. For these reasons, I do not regard this as a case where considerations of general deterrence are totally outweighed by other factors. Although the offender's brain injury remains a matter to be taken into account in his subjective case on sentence, general deterrence remains a matter of importance. 

85The evidence of Dr Furst is that the offender poses a ""moderate"" risk to the community in terms of future offending. He suggested that such risk could be reduced by, amongst other things, the offender engaging in a ""suitable program"", and also by the improvement, over a period of time, in dynamic factors such as his attitudes, levels of insight, and impulsivity. Dr Furst expressed no clear view about the likelihood of such improvement and there is no evidence before me that the offender has undergone, or that he intends to undergo, any program(s) of the kind Dr Furst had in mind. Whether there will be any improvement in those dynamic factors to which Dr Furst referred is largely speculative. In these circumstances I am unable to reach any firm conclusion as to the offender's prospects of rehabilitation. 

86As to special circumstances, the authorities make it clear that circumstances which are not properly regarded as being ""special"" should not be elevated into that category (see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at 719; [68]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [20]). In order for special circumstances to be made out there must exist significant positive signs which show that, if the offender is allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, and not merely a possibility (see R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243 at [20]). On the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that this is the case and accordingly, I do not find special circumstances. The period in which the offender will be on parole will be significant in any event. 

THE TOTAL SENTENCE
87The Crown did not submit that the circumstances of the present offence of murder fell into the worst category. However, he submitted that the level of heinousness was nevertheless very substantial and that it called for a sentence which reflected that fact. He submitted that the necessity to ensure the protection of the community, along with general deterrence, were factors which loomed large. He pointed to the fact that the offence was committed in the early hours of the morning, in a suburban house, whilst the deceased was asleep. 

88Mr Stratton conceded that the offence of murder was obviously serious and I have dealt with his submissions in respect of various other matters which were in issue. 

89Although the submissions of the parties concentrated on the offence of murder, the Crown submitted that the offence of malicious wounding of deceased's wife was nevertheless a serious offence committed against a separate victim, who had also been asleep in the house, and who was injured as a result of the offender's attack. In these circumstances he submitted that there should be a degree of accumulation in respect of the sentence imposed for that offence. Mr Stratton expressly conceded that there should be some degree of accumulation, although he submitted it should be small. 

90As the offender is to be sentenced for more than one offence, I have had regard to the principles of totality (see Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610). In light of the submissions of the parties, I have concluded that there should be partial accumulation of the sentences imposed, to the extent of 3 months, to reflect those principles. The offender has been in custody since the date of his arrest on 4 March 2009 and the sentences I impose will be backdated to commence on that date.

91Fadi Shamoun I sentence you as follows:

(i) In respect of the offence of the murder of Richard Carruthers you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment commencing on 4 June 2009 and ending on 3 June 2029, with an additional term of 7 years imprisonment, commencing on 4 June 2029 and ending on 3 June 2036, a total term of 27 years imprisonment.

(ii) In respect of the offence of maliciously wounding Phuong Carruthers, you are sentenced to a non parole period of 9 months imprisonment, commencing on 4 June 2009 and ending on 3 March 2010, with an additional term of 3 months imprisonment, commencing on 4 March 2010 and ending on 3 June 2010, a total term of 12 months imprisonment. 

(iii) You will be obliged to serve a total non-parole period of 20 years and 3 months imprisonment, commencing on 4 June 2009 and ending on 3 September 2029. 

(iv) You will be eligible for release on parole on 4 September 2029 and your sentence will expire on 3 June 2036.

2759566,R v Aslett [2012] NSWSC 711,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The offender Douglas Aslett was indicted for the murder of Slobodan Simic at Cabramatta West on 2 August 2009. The Crown subsequently accepted his plea of guilty to manslaughter, entered in the Parramatta Local Court on 6 September 2011, in complete discharge of that indictment.

The offence

2The following findings of fact are drawn from an agreed statement of facts tendered by the Crown in the sentencing proceedings.

3James Aslett and his cousins, the offender and WA, were each charged with one count of murder in relation to the death of the deceased. They were to be tried separately. The offender and WA are brothers. At the time of the offence the brothers resided with their mother Kathy Aslett, her boyfriend and their younger sister in Cabramatta West. James Aslett lived nearby in Claymore and frequently visited his cousins at their home.

4Kathy Aslett's property backed onto a vacant block of land, which was itself situated adjacent to a T-intersection in Cabramatta West. The brothers used the vacant block as a shortcut to their home through a gap in the fence at the rear of their property.

5The deceased was in a relationship with Debra Jones. She lived approximately 200 metres west of the brothers' house.

6On the evening of Saturday 1 August 2009, someone set fire to a car that was parked upon the vacant block of land. WA owned that car. The brothers spoke to each other that evening about waiting until the following day and attacking the person who set fire to the car. The offender and James Aslett went to the vacant land the next day and spoke to a neighbour about who might have set fire to the car. During that conversation, the offender expressed his belief that the deceased or his associate had done so. While the offender and James Aslett were still standing on the land, the deceased rode up Sulman Road towards them on his bicycle.

7The offender and James Aslett became engaged in a verbal argument with the deceased in the course of which they yelled out threats to the deceased. As he turned to run away, they threw pieces of brick or rocks at him. These struck the deceased who started bleeding. He returned to his property to wash the blood off his arm. The offender and James Aslett returned to Kathy Aslett's property where they armed themselves respectively with a large black saw-toothed machete and a baseball bat. WA was there as well and he armed himself with a handgun. The offender and James Aslett then ran about 100 metres up the street towards the deceased's property. WA followed them.

8The deceased would appear to have heard yelling and emerged from his house onto the street. He took off his shirt and approached the offender and James Aslett. The deceased was unarmed. He encouraged the offender and the others to drop their weapons and fight him with their fists. The offender and James Aslett swung their weapons at the deceased repeatedly. The deceased was struck by the baseball bat. At some point a friend of the deceased armed himself with a machete and came to his aid. Neither the offender nor his companions was injured.

9WA fired a number of rounds in the direction of the deceased as he turned away. Upon hearing the first gunshot, James Aslett turned and saw WA and ran back towards the Aslett home. The offender also ran back in that direction. One of the shots fired by WA struck the deceased in the back.

10The offender and the others fled through the vacant block into Kathy Aslett's property. They discarded the baseball bat, the machete, a shirt worn by one of them, as well as the deceased's shirt and singlet, at the rear steps to the premises. They then left that property and sought refuge at a nearby property. WA disposed of the firearm in the garden of a nearby house. He fled from the area.

11Police were in attendance at the scene within minutes of the shooting. An ambulance also attended and took the deceased to hospital where he died shortly afterwards. The offender and James Aslett were arrested a few hours later. The offender exercised his right to silence. He was later charged with the murder of the deceased. He has remained in custody since that time.

Basis of plea of guilty to manslaughter

12The agreed statement of facts disclosed the following matters. The offender's plea of guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased was accepted by the Crown on the basis that the offender entered into a joint criminal enterprise with James Aslett and WA to threaten or use unlawful violence against the deceased while each was armed with a weapon. The offender contemplated the possibility that one of the others James Aslett or WA might do an unlawful and dangerous act toward the deceased carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. Notwithstanding his contemplation, the offender maintained his participation in the joint criminal enterprise to threaten or use unlawful violence against the deceased. During the joint criminal enterprise WA shot and killed the deceased, constituting at least an unlawful and dangerous act.

Sentencing for manslaughter

13In R v Van Xuan Nguyen [2005] NSWSC 600 at [21] - [24], Johnson J set out the relevant sentencing principles in the case of the crime of manslaughter. In setting out the paragraphs referred to, I respectfully adopt his Honour's summary:

""[21] The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: s 24 Crimes Act 1900. The offence of manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life, and as such it has long been recognised as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. In R v MacDonald (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, BC9501664), the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Hunt CJ at CL) said at page 8: 

'Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. This may involve a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. (See R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.) The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectations of that system.'

[22] In R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, BC9501665), Gleeson CJ (Grove and Ireland JJ agreeing) said at page 4: 

'It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.'

[23] The importance of denunciation in sentencing for manslaughter has been stressed: R v MacDonald, above, at page 9. Little assistance is to be gained by reference to sentencing statistics which encompass all forms of manslaughter, save so far as they disclose a broad range within which sentences have been passed since their compilation began: R v Mohamad Ali [2005] NSWSC 334 at paragraph 61. 

[24] A sentence for manslaughter must reflect the seriousness of unlawfully taking the life of another human being and it is not of great moment whether the killing is characterised as coming within any particular head of manslaughter. Rather, it is a question of what sentence is required to reflect the objective facts by way of retribution and denunciation, the subjective circumstances and, if necessary, deterrence: R v Walsh (2004) 142 A Crim R 140 at 149 (paragraph 40); R v Mohamad Ali, above, at paragraph 56.""

Subjective features

14The offender was born in Sydney in April 1990 and is now aged 22 years. His father is Turkish. His parents separated before his birth. His mother is from an indigenous background and she principally raised the offender in the context of the extended family. He lived his early years in Dubbo before moving to Homebush, Busby and Bonnyrigg. For the ten years prior to the commission of the offence, the offender resided with his mother in her home at Cabramatta West.

15The offender has two half siblings from different fathers. His younger brother WA is currently serving a sentence of detention in relation to the same incident. His younger half sister is aged about 12 or 13 and lives at home with her parents. The offender's stepfather has lived with his mother for the past 13 or 14 years. The offender has a good relationship with his stepfather and has recently resumed contact with his natural father who commenced visiting him in gaol after his arrest. The offender had only seen his father sporadically during his childhood. The offender is on good terms with his father's wife and his father has offered the offender accommodation as well as assistance in obtaining employment following his release.

16The offender has a partner who is aged 22 years. They have been together since the age of 18. They have a son who is nearly three years old. Prior to his incarceration, the offender lived with his partner, either in his grandmother's home or with his mother. His partner remains supportive and continues to visit the offender in gaol with their son.

17The offender attended numerous primary schools as his family moved around a lot during his childhood. He reads well and has basic skills in arithmetic and mathematics. He was, however, frequently suspended from school for fighting in grades 5 and 6. Sometimes he was provoked to fight but not always. The offender was expelled from Miller High School in Year 7 after only a few months at the school. He then went to Hoxton Park High School and was shortly thereafter expelled having been accused of selling drugs. He denies that accusation. He was thereafter transferred to Campbell House at Glenfield for children with behavioural problems. He completed Year 9 at that school. He continued to exhibit behavioural problems, including fighting. He completed Year 10 through TAFE but appears never to have been awarded his School Certificate.

18The following year the offender was referred to an Aboriginal training programme through the CFMEU at Lidcombe TAFE. It was a full time course involving carpentry, bricklaying, tiling, painting, decorating and scaffolding. He completed that course but was unable to secure employment. He has never been in paid employment at any time. He has applied to Centrelink but has had difficulty complying with the programmes. He spent time with his cousins and friends smoking cannabis and ""hanging around"". When his partner became pregnant he spent more time with her. He is looking forward to being a parent although he was arrested only shortly before his son's birth.

19Despite his behavioural problems, the offender was never referred for counselling until the Youth Drug Court sent him in 2007 to an anger management programme. He was out on bail at the time. He did not complete the course and was ultimately given 80 hours of community service.

20The offender acknowledges having had anger management issues since childhood. He describes himself as having had a hot temper and a short fuse. If people looked at him ""the wrong way"" he would interpret that as sinister and respond accordingly. He has always been in the company of ""a tough crowd"". He said his first assault charge was a result of someone staring at him, ""making him edgy"". He has calmed down somewhat in gaol and keeps to himself as much as possible. He has not been given psychological assistance in gaol and does not feel that he requires any specific counselling.

21The offender has smoked cannabis since the age of about 11 or 12 ""whenever he could find it"". Cannabis was effective in reducing his levels of stress. He began to drink alcohol at the age of 15 and drank in occasional binges with his friends. Alcohol was never problematic for him. He experimented with amphetamines and ecstasy when he was 18 as well as drinking occasionally. With the exception of cannabis, he gave up all drug use when his partner fell pregnant. He has refused cannabis in gaol and has submitted uniformly clean urine tests. He has been abstinent from all drugs in gaol without assistance.

22The offender has strong bonds of affection with his mother and her extended family. He had spent periods staying with his maternal grandmother when his mother ""could not handle him"". He was 7 or 8 the first time and about 13 or 14 the second time. He has had a stormy relationship with his brother WA, one of his co-accused.

Psychologist's pre-sentence report 

23The offender was referred to Anita Duffy, a psychologist who interviewed him at Long Bay MSPC on 20 February 2012. The offender told Ms Duffy ""the whole affair should not have happened"". He regarded it as a fight that got out of control. He said that he had offered to settle the dispute with the deceased in a fistfight, but the deceased's friends were also armed with knives and machetes.

24The offender reported being under considerable stress in the two years following his arrest when he faced a murder charge. He has felt depressed in gaol, but has managed to deal with his anxiety and stress without resort to drugs. The offender is hopeful of being reclassified and sent to Windsor or Oberon where he can participate in work related activities.

25Ms Duffy reported that the offender did not specifically express remorse or contrition over the offence to her, but did say frequently that he ""wished the whole thing had never happened"". The offender had no personal grudge against the deceased because he did not know him previously. He reacted angrily to the suspicion that the deceased or one of his friends had burnt his brother's car.

26Ms Duffy's conclusions included the following opinions:

""Douglas Aslett's presentation at our session together, the history he gave me and the results of objective personality assessment reveal a young man who has developed an acute sensitivity to ridicule, humiliation or other forms of criticism. He perceives the world as a dangerous place where he must be vigilant to threat or harm. He describes for example feeling ""edgy"" if someone looks at him in a way which he perceives as threatening. From a young age he has retaliated against such provocation through fighting, which led to expulsion, suspension and referral to a special school for children with behavioural difficulties.

Douglas was brought up in a family where at times there was chaos and instability. There were occasions when he and his siblings resided with extended family members such as his grandmother and his maternal aunt. There were other problems with the Aslett family such as that on at least one occasion one of his uncles held the children hostage and threatened their lives...

Thus Douglas has been exposed to violence during formative years in his youth, and from this may have learned to develop undue sensitivity to provocation or other threats in his environment. He also expresses extreme loyalty towards his family, his cousins, his brothers and friends...

Douglas' history and personality profile suggests a strong need for participation in programmes that enable him to deal more effectively with stress and triggers of anger. Stress management and anger management programmes would be appropriate for his needs, as well as such courses as Think First which enable him to consider the consequences and develop alternate courses of action.

His rehabilitation needs also include education and vocational training programmes, and preferably employment in a working gaol. It is considered that he would also benefit from close supervision by the Probation and Parole Service following his release to facilitate his reintegration in the community to ensure that he has appropriate accommodation, employment. He could benefit from participation in community based programmes to prevent relapse into drugs and reinforce strategies of anger and stress management. It is thought that indigenous programmes in particular may have more relevance to Douglas' needs.""

Findings concerning the offence

27Having regard to the evidence before me I make the following findings of fact that bear upon the objective seriousness of the offence. 

28First, there was no long-standing enmity or grievance that existed between the offender and the deceased. Any feelings that developed in the mind of the offender toward the deceased would appear to be those that arose in the limited circumstance that the offender was told and apparently accepted that the deceased had been responsible for burning his brother's car the previous evening. 

29Secondly, and shortly afterwards, there developed a heated exchange between the offender, his brother and his cousin and the deceased in the course of which rocks and bricks were thrown at the deceased. 

30Thirdly, the offender, his brother and his cousin retreated to their home to obtain weapons that included a machete, a baseball bat and a handgun. 

31Fourthly, the offender was the person armed with the machete but he did not use it to strike the deceased. 

32Fifthly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew that his brother WA was armed with a handgun and that the offender contemplated at least the possibility that WA might use it in the course of doing an unlawful and dangerous act towards the deceased. However, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knew it would be used in the course of the confrontation with the deceased. 

33Sixthly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender and at least his brother or his cousin had agreed that an act, involving at least a minor assault, would be perpetrated upon the deceased in the street and that the offender participated by being present, thereby aiding his brother and his cousin or one of them to commit the agreed act. 

34Seventhly, there was a degree of planning on the part of the offender to the extent that following the initial confrontation with the deceased, the offender retreated to his house to arm himself with a machete before returning to confront the deceased again. 

35Eighthly, there was no opportunity for the offender to intervene in any way that could have prevented WA from using the handgun to shoot the deceased. 

36Finally, following the shooting the offender, his brother and his cousin fled the scene.

Conclusions concerning objective seriousness of the offence

37There is no standard non-parole period for the offence of manslaughter. However, the objective seriousness of the offence continues to be a highly important consideration in the sentencing exercise. A close examination and a qualitative assessment of the level of objective seriousness of the offence should be encouraged. The objective seriousness of the offence is but one of the factors forming part of the sentencing exercise synthesis.

38Such an approach appears to me to be critical in the present case. There was a plan to confront the deceased. It consisted of two stages. The first was ill-considered and ill-formed. It was largely, if not entirely, spontaneous, impulsive and sparked by the simple and unfortunate arrival of the deceased upon his bike at a time when the offender and his cousin had formed, or were in the course of forming, a frail conclusion about the deceased's responsibility for the destruction of the car. The second stage was less spontaneous and more considered. It involved a temporary cessation of active hostility to acquire weapons further and better to conduct the assault. It necessarily involved a decision to continue with an attack upon the deceased when the attack had for practical purposes and appearances come to an end.

39The offender did not shoot the deceased. It is not suggested that any act on his part directly caused or contributed to his death. I consider that the offence lies somewhere just below the middle range of seriousness for the offence of manslaughter.

The plea of guilty

40The offender was originally charged with murder. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court on the first available opportunity following the Crown's offer to accept his plea to the lesser charge in full discharge of the indictment. There was agreement about the likely length of any trial. There was also a significant prospect that any jury would ultimately have been confronted with a multiplicity of witness accounts of what occurred, which varied in several respects. There was therefore a considerable saving to the Court and to the community in terms of resources and time. 

41It is appropriate in these circumstances that the offender should be given a discount of 25 percent for his early plea.

Contrition and remorse

42The offender did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings. He has neither written a letter nor prepared, with or without assistance, any document in which he sets out his feelings following the death of the deceased. He has told Ms Duffy that the whole thing got out of hand and should never have happened, but this is far from an expression of contrition or remorse.

43I indicated in the course of sentencing James Aslett, who gave evidence about his feelings following the death of the deceased, that an infelicity with language or difficulty speaking about sensitive emotional matters in a public setting such as a courtroom, should never be confused with a lack of remorse. The same cannot be said when an offender says nothing to me about the issue, so that I am left with only the second hand remarks of the offender passed on to a psychologist whose report is later tendered.

44I cannot be satisfied in this case that the offender has demonstrated any contrition, or retains any feelings of remorse for what he has done. This is because there is no satisfactory material before me upon the basis of which I would be entitled to draw such an inference or to form any such conclusion.

Special circumstances

45The offender's father and partner gave evidence before me. It seems probable that the offender will in the first instance live with his father upon his release and only gradually move to the point where he takes up a life with his partner and their child. I was impressed with her maturity to the extent that she recognised the inadvisability of immediately attempting to resume their relationship under the same roof before the offender has had some time to readjust to life in the community. The offender's historical difficulties with violence are unlikely to have been completely resolved before that occurs, and the availability of constant help to address this problem will in my view be necessary following his release. Despite the likelihood of assistance from his family, the offender will require a longer than usual period on parole for this purpose in my view. I find special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

Determination of sentence

46The circumstances that give rise to these proceedings are pathetic and unnecessary and were completely avoidable. The offender contributed significantly to the escalation of the terrible violence perpetrated against an innocent victim whose life was tragically and senselessly cut short. The whole incident was the result of a combination of ignorance and stupidity, fuelled by the combatants' inflated senses of self-importance and entitlement. The offender was no small contributor to that combination as well. There can never be any scope in a civilised society for the settling of scores, whether real or imagined, by dangerous and uncontrolled aggression. The consequences for all concerned have been uniformly painful and unsatisfactory.

47It will be apparent that the roles of the offender and his cousin James Aslett were relevantly indistinguishable, apart from the fact that James Aslett struck the deceased with his baseball bat whereas the offender did not strike the deceased with his machete. I also note that James Aslett gave evidence of his contrition and remorse, which I accepted, whereas the offender did no do so. Finally, the offender pleaded guilty in circumstances attracting a 25 percent discount, whereas James Aslett did not plead guilty until the first day of his trial for murder, attracting a discount of only 15 percent. In accordance with the principles of parity, I have attempted as far as possible, therefore, to sentence the offender to a similar term of imprisonment to that imposed by me upon James Aslett in as much as the notional starting point for each sentence is almost exactly the same. The difference between the head sentences and the non-parole periods for each man is the result of the application of differing discounts for their respective guilty pleas.

48I have read a victim impact statement written by the brother of the deceased. He spoke of his own reaction to the death, as well as that of the extended family. His mother in particular would appear to be labouring with the burden of grief in her senior years in a very disabling way. The death of the deceased is undoubtedly a terrible and unending fact of life for her and the rest of the family. Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of his family and friends who remember him. I am however mindful of the principles referred to in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, and I must conform to them.

49Taking into account all of the objective facts and all of the subjective circumstances, and other factors required to be taken into account under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I consider that the appropriate sentence in this case is one of imprisonment for 6 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 4 years. It is accepted that the commencement date for any sentence that I impose is 2 August 2009 and I propose to order that the sentence to be imposed will operate from that date. The sentence as proposed also has regard to my finding of special circumstances.

50Douglas Aslett, for the manslaughter of Slobodan Simic to which you have pleaded guilty you are sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 4 years, which will be taken to have commenced on 2 August 2009 and which will expire on 1 August 2013, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 2 August 2013 and expiring on 1 November 2015. The first day upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 2 August 2013.

2759567,Perez v R [2012] NSWCCA 167,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The application for leave to appeal against sentence in this matter was heard on 2 July 2012.  At the completion of the hearing, the Court made the following orders:(1) Leave to appeal granted.(2) Appeal dismissed.The Court reserved its reasons.
Sentence appealed from2The appellant was charged by the Director of Public Prosecutions with one offence, namely that on 3 February 2010 at Pitt Town, being in company with a co-offender, did rob Matthew Britton of a sum of $3,200, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  He entered a plea of guilty to the charge and was sentenced by English DCJ to imprisonment for four years, commencing on 2 September 2011, with a non-parole period of two years.  The non-parole period is due to expire on 1 September 2013.
3The plea was entered on 14 March 2011 and the hearing on sentence was held on 2 September 2011.  Having previously been on bail, the appellant was remanded in custody on the latter date, judgment being delivered on 16 September 2011.
4The notice of appeal, filed on 23 March 2012, contained two grounds, alleging that the sentencing judge:
(1) failed to assess, or adequately assess, the appellant's role in the offending and therefore failed to assess the seriousness of the offence; and
(2) erred in imposing a sentence that, when compared with the sentence imposed on his co-offender and giving due allowance for their differing roles and antecedents, gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.
5It may be noted, for the purpose of the second ground, that the co-offender, Reece Manihera, was sentenced at the same time as the appellant and received an identical sentence.
Factual background6On 10 January 2010 the victim and the co-offender attended a social gathering; they were known to each other prior to that time.  During the evening, the victim told the co-offender that his father was interested in buying a campervan.  Some minutes later, the co-offender told the victim that he knew of a campervan which a friend wished to sell.
7Over the next few days the victim discussed the possible purchase with his father and, on 2 February 2010, the victim sent the co-offender a text message asking for further details.  The co-offender responded saying the van was still for sale at a price of $3,000-$3,200.  Arrangements were made for the victim to inspect the van and the victim told the co-offender that he would bring the money in case he decided to buy it.  The money was provided to the victim by his father.
8At around 5pm on 3 February 2010 the co-offender arrived at the victim's home and the victim entered the front passenger seat of the car.  The co-offender then drove to a nearby service station where the appellant got in to the back seat of the vehicle, behind the victim.  The co-offender then drove to Pitt Town, where he asked the victim if he had brought the $3,200.  On receiving an affirmative answer, the co-offender brought the vehicle to a sudden halt, struck the victim in the face with a closed fist and snatched the money from his grasp.  He told him to get out of the car.
9At about the same time, the victim felt pain at the back of his right shoulder and turned to see the appellant holding a homemade ""taser"" device.
10The victim then opened the car door and fell out, but apparently stood by the car to plead for the return of his father's money.  The appellant then wound down his window and moved the ""taser"" device in the direction of the victim, which caused him to step further away from the vehicle.  The car drove off, the victim having left his bag, jacket and mobile phone in the vehicle.
11The matter was immediately reported to the police, who searched the co-offender's home and the vehicle later that evening.  The victim's bag and jacket were found in the vehicle but the mobile phone was not recovered.  Attempts to locate the appellant and the co-offender were unsuccessful.  However, the appellant presented himself at Windsor police station on 12 February 2010 and his co-offender presented himself four days later.  
Judgment on sentence12The factual background set out above was derived from a statement of facts tendered for the purposes of sentencing.  They were recounted by the judge, together with a summary of the pre-sentence reports in respect of the appellant and the co-offender.  Neither gave evidence.
13The personal circumstances of the appellant, as accepted by the sentencing judge, may be briefly stated.  At the time of the offence, the appellant was 21 years of age.  He had a record involving minor damage to a railway carriage which was of no consequence in respect of the present offending.  He had been suspended from school for smoking and fighting.  He admitted to the probation and parole officer in April 2011 that he spent approximately $200 a week on cannabis and gambled approximately $400 per month.  The sentencing judge noted that the probation and parole officer described the appellant, when interviewed, as displaying ""neither contrition nor victim empathy"" and as demonstrating ""a surprising lack of insight into the impact of abusing illicit substances and the link between his drug addiction and his criminal behaviour"".  She also noted, however, that a psychologist, to whom he had been referred by his solicitor, had taken a more positive view of his prospects.  The sentencing judge said in respect of both the appellant and the co-offender that each had ""good prospects for rehabilitation and are unlikely to re-offend"": Judgment, p 10.
14Her Honour noted, correctly, that guidance as to the appropriate range of sentencing for the offence was to be obtained from the judgment of this Court in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346.  That judgment required that in all but exceptional cases, a custodial sentence was required and a benchmark term of four to five years was considered appropriate.  Her Honour did not think that this was an exceptional case warranting other than a custodial sentence, a conclusion not challenged on appeal.  Her Honour summarised the circumstances of both offenders, whom she noted were relatively young, in the following terms (Judgment, p 9):
""There was, I find, a considerable degree of planning to entice the victim into their company on a false pretence and to ensure that he had a large sum of cash on him.  Actual violence was perpetrated upon him by both offenders, a punch to the face by Manihera and an electric shock administered by Perez.  He was taken by the two offenders in a vehicle and driven around before being assaulted and robbed and then left by the roadside.  No doubt a very frightening experience for him.  In addition to the loss of $3,200, he also had his phone taken.  ...  $3,200 is a significant sum of money compared to the relative small amounts considered in the guideline judgment.  The motivation of Mr Manihera was to prove his worth to his negative peers and the motivation of Mr Perez was purely financial gain.""
15On the basis that each had good prospects for rehabilitation and that each was facing his first time in gaol, there was a finding of special circumstances, resulting in a lengthier than normal period of eligibility for parole and supervised release.
Ground 1: role of appellant16Much was sought to be made by the appellant of the evidence that the whole event was planned by the co-offender, commencing with the conversation at the social gathering on 10 January.  The appellant submitted that, on the evidence, he had no involvement in the matter until the day of the offence and that he had no involvement in the offence itself until after the co-offender had assaulted the victim and taken his money.
17There are two difficulties with this approach.  First, it relies upon an inference that the co-offender was involved in planning the robbery from the initial social contact with the victim on 10 January.  However, there was no finding to that effect and the inference is implausible as the co-offender made no attempt to contact the victim thereafter, it being the victim who raised the matter again by contacting the co-offender the day before the offence.  Whether the plan to meet the following day to inspect the campervan involved a plan to ""rip off"" the victim, devised by the co-offender to which the appellant merely adhered the following day, is unclear.  The appellant did not so describe it to the probation and parole officer.  The officer noted in a report of 28 April 2011 (page 2):
""Mr Perez said that on the day of the offence he met the co-offender in the afternoon after work.  He said they smoked cannabis at his home and at the home of the co-offender prior to the incident.  He said the idea to undertake the offence was conceived at the co-offender's home.
The offender's account of the offence, to this Service, was not completely consistent with the Full Facts.  Mr Perez said that he and the co-accused had initially arranged to meet the victim with the intention of acquiring marijuana for the $3,200, not a campervan.  Mr Perez also said that the item he used to create an electric current was not a Taser but was electrodes attached to a camera.  He said that he had learned how to make and use the device whilst at school.
Mr Perez described his behaviour as 'pretty stupid' and that he made a 'big mistake'.  He said that he had never intended to obtain the marijuana and that $3,200 was not enough money to acquire the quantity of marijuana arranged to be supplied.""
18The critical issue for present purposes was the concession by Mr Perez to the parole officer that he was involved in planning the offence.  The suggestion that he only became involved after the attack by Mr Manihera ignores the fact that he was picked up by Mr Manihera after the victim, so that he sat in the back seat and had with him the homemade taser device, which he later used in apparent pursuit of the common purpose.  The appellant also described the co-offender as ""his best friend"" at the time.  There was no relevant error demonstrated by the sentencing judge in concluding that each was involved in the planning of the offence.
Ground 2: parity19The assumption underlying ground 2 was that there was such a marked disparity in the culpability of each that the imposition of equal sentences amounted to a disproportionate response calculated to erode confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice: see Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 610 (Mason J).
20Again, the factual premise underlying the appellant's submission was the supposed disparity in the roles played by the co-offender and the appellant.
21The submission ignores the fact that this was a common purpose offence carried out in company.  Although the contact between the victim and the pair was with the co-offender, who knew him better than the appellant did, collected the victim in his car, assaulted him and grabbed the money, it was the appellant who came armed with a weapon, which he used.  The failure to distinguish the culpability of the co-offender from that of the appellant demonstrated no error warranting intervention by this Court.  The imposition of identical sentences did not, therefore, constitute manifestly disproportionate sentencing, as contended.
Conclusion22For these reasons, the grounds of appeal were not made out and the appeal was properly rejected.
23HARRISON J:  I agree that the judgment of Basten JA accurately records the basis upon which the Court earlier indicated that the appeal should be dismissed.  I wish only to add the following short remarks.
24In the course of his submissions in this Court, counsel for the applicant sought to compare the things done by the applicant with those done by his co-accused, in an attempt to establish that the (arguably) smaller number of discrete acts performed by the applicant favoured him in an assessment of the role that he played in the commission of the offence.  That  type of analysis may sometimes, even often, be helpful in delineating the respective roles of numerous participants in a single criminal exercise.  I do not think it could ever be of much assistance in circumstances such as this case, where the applicant's participation included coming armed with a homemade taser device and using it with the apparent intention of overcoming or subduing the victim of the crime.
25BEECH-JONES J:  I agree with Basten JA.

		20 August 2012",2012-07-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759579,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Wililo and Anor [2012] NSWSC 713,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: By Summons filed on 9 February 2012, the Plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), seeks relief arising from the dismissal at the Downing Centre Local Court on 20 January 2012 of a charge of assault against the First Defendant, Kasian Wililo.

2The Plaintiff appeals under s.56(1)(c) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 alleging error of law on the part of the Magistrate, Magistrate O'Shane. In the alternative, the Plaintiff seeks prerogative relief if there is an impediment to the grant of relief under the statutory appeal.

3Given the alternative claim for prerogative relief contained in the Summons, the Local Court of New South Wales was joined as the Second Defendant. In accordance with usual practice, the Second Defendant has filed an appearance submitting to the orders of the Court, save as to costs. 

4At the hearing in this Court, Ms NJ Adams, Crown Advocate and Ms JE Davidson appeared for the Plaintiff. Mr CJG Smith of counsel appeared for the First Defendant. 

The Local Court Hearing

5The First Defendant was charged by Court Attendance Notice with an offence under s.61 Crimes Act 1900 that, on 25 August 2011 at Kings Cross, he did assault Christopher Martin.

6The First Defendant pleaded not guilty to this charge. The hearing of the matter came before Magistrate O'Shane at the Downing Centre Local Court on 20 January 2012. At that hearing, Sergeant Kahn appeared as prosecutor and Ms Edin, solicitor, appeared for the First Defendant. 

7At the commencement of the hearing, the prosecutor indicated that five witnesses would be called in the prosecution case - two ambulance officers and three police officers. In accordance with Local Court practice, the prosecution witness statements had been served on the defence prior to the hearing. In response to an enquiry from the Magistrate, Ms Edin indicated that consent was not given for any of the witness statements to be tendered.

8The prosecutor called two witnesses, Mr Martin and Constable Clint Hawes, although (as will be seen), the prosecutor sought to call further witnesses as well in the prosecution case. The Magistrate's approach to this issue gives rise to a ground of appeal to this Court.

9The learned Magistrate did not deliver a judgment which summarised the evidence adduced at the hearing. Indeed, a further ground of appeal is that her Honour erred in law in not providing adequate reasons for her determination to dismiss the proceedings. A consequence of this approach is that there is no part of her Honour's reasons which may be utilised at this point to summarise the evidence adduced at the hearing. 

10What follows (at [11]-[22]) is a summary which, in my view, adequately and accurately describes the course of events at the hearing up to the point where the evidence ended, and her Honour engaged in a dialogue with the prosecutor before dismissing the charge.

11The complainant, Christopher Martin, gave evidence in chief to the following effect:

(a)He was working as a paramedic at Paddington Ambulance Station on the morning of 25 August 2011, when at approximately 6.00 am, he was called (together with Ambulance Officer Karen Jacobs) to ""an assault in Kings Cross, outside the McDonalds on Darlinghurst Road"". 

(b)There appeared to be two patients on the scene. He assessed one patient, who declined ambulance services. Mr Martin then assessed a second patient, who was between 185 cm and 190 cm tall and had dark skin and dreadlocks. This patient, the First Defendant, said ""he had been punched in the head, but couldn't recall how or why. He's then said that his jaw was hurting"". Mr Martin began an assessment on this patient, who requested that an ambulance transport him to hospital.

(c)The patient said to Mr Martin ""My jaw hurts, my jaw fucking hurts. Are you a professional? Take me to hospital. Are you a professional?"". He kept repeating ""Are you a professional?"" and appeared quite agitated.

(d)Mr Martin continued assessing the patient, asking him whether he had been knocked out or knocked to the ground and palpating his neck area. There did not appear to him to be any injuries, but the patient was complaining of some pain to his jaw. Mr Martin noted that ""He was able to talk freely with an open mouth, but he was still complaining of pain to his jaw"".

(e)The patient wanted to go to hospital, so Mr Martin put him in the back of the ambulance, ""in what we call the airway seat, which is just behind the drive[r]. Put on his seatbelt, I've given him an icepack, and then I've begun looking over him further, so doing another assessment, and also a blood pressure, and some other things, and continued on with my questioning"".

(f)The patient produced his driver's licence showing his name to be Kasian Wililo. Mr Martin's partner, Karen Jacobs, started driving the ambulance towards the hospital. Mr Martin continued to treat the First Defendant as the ambulance was driving along. The treatment consisted of ""[j]ust further questioning, everything that I'd done by that stage had - it appeared to me as if there wasn't too much more that we could do to him apart from transport him to hospital. From there we've - as we were driving along all he kept saying was 'Are you a professional, are you a fucking professional, do something for me. My head hurts, my jaw hurts, do something for me'"". Mr Martin replied ""Yes I'm a professional"".

(g) As the ambulance proceeded, the First Defendant became more agitated and ""more restless, more swearing, more repeating of questioning and everything else, a little bit louder in his talk as well and then he's leaned forward and spat on the floor of the ambulance"". The First Defendant spat on the floor directly in front of the airway seat.

(h) Mr Martin then said ""Don't fucking do that, this is an ambulance you filthy pig"". The First Defendant said ""'My jaw hurts, are you a professional' and he ""Kept ranting and repeating himself about that and then he said 'I don't care' and he started becoming more and more agitated. I've then instructed Karen to pull over the car. ... I've then instructed him to get out of the car, he wouldn't get out of the ambulance. He then started to get out of the ambulance, realised where we were and what [sic] proceeded to go back into the ambulance and asked us to take him back to where his friend was with the police"".

(i) At that time, the ambulance was stopped just south of the roundabout on Ward Avenue at Kings Cross Road. The First Defendant got back into the ambulance, into the seat he had been sitting in. Mr Martin and Ms Jacobs stood on the passenger side, leaving the sliding door open and standing about two to three metres away from the vehicle.

(j) The First Defendant ""was getting really really loud and shouting"". Mr Martin could not recall what he was saying but ""there was some swear words"". The First Defendant then ""threw the ice pack that I gave him and it struck me in the side of the head"".

(k) The First Defendant then picked up a patient health care record book that was in the back of the ambulance. ""He's picked that up, he's begun yelling more frantically, he's thrown it outside the car as my partner Karen was on the radio walking again two to three metres away from the car and it struck her in the right ankle and nearly knocked her off her feet. He's then began swinging his arms around in the back of the vehicle, hitting various objects"".

(I) After saying something along the lines of ""I haven't been in a fight tonight, maybe I should get out and fight you"", the First Defendant got out of the ambulance, came towards Mr Martin, who was standing two to three metres from the vehicle and ""shaped up in an aggressive manner"".

(m) The First Defendant took one or two steps after exiting the ambulance, by which point he was ""right in front"" of Mr Martin. He ""sort of lifted his fists up in front of his face"" then ""swung his right fist and it struck me on the left hand side of the face ... sort of the temple region ... just to the side of the eye"" (a photograph which was later admitted in evidence depicted such an injury).

(n) Mr Martin and the First Defendant began to ""scuffle"" together. The two men were ""wrestling and swinging punches at each other, I was trying to defend myself and I'm not sure how long that went on for"". Mr Martin was not sure how many punches he threw but said ""it would have been at least half a dozen each ...it was very very frantic"". The First Defendant was using both hands and Mr Martin ""was trying to defend with my left and trying to fight with my right"". In the background, Mr Martin ""sort of heard in my peripheral"" Ms Jacobs on the radio asking for urgent police assistance.

(o) The two men broke away from the scuffle. Out of the corner of his eye, Mr Martin saw ""a reasonably tall gentleman running towards the patient, wearing shorts and thongs and a T-shirt and I said 'Leave it, the police will be here in a minute' and he's like I am an off duty officer, get down on the ground'"" (this was Constable Hawes, who gave evidence at the hearing).

(p) The off-duty officer started to hold the First Defendant and he and Mr Martin detained the First Defendant on the ground until police arrived.

(q) Mr Martin sustained ""a little bit of bruising and swelling to the left side of my eye"" and ""a bit of pain and swelling to my right thumb"" (a further photograph admitted in evidence depicted the hand injury).

12In cross-examination by Ms Edin, Mr Martin gave the following additional evidence:

(a)He agreed that the First Defendant appeared to be in pain.

(b)He gave the First Defendant an icepack for the pain and offered him Panadol, but the First Defendant did not accept the Panadol.

(c)He could not recall whether the First Defendant had blood coming out of his mouth, but denied that the First Defendant spat blood on the floor of the ambulance.

(d) He felt ""abused"" and ""didn't feel safe in the back of the ambulance with him"" and he felt ""threatened for myself and for my safety"". The First Defendant was ""aggressive and agitated but he didn't threaten me"".

(e)He intended to leave the First Defendant on the side of the road. He determined the First Defendant to have a ""GCS of 15 which is a full alertness"".

(f)He tried to assist the First Defendant out of the ambulance physically.

(g)There was a ""struggle"" when the First Defendant refused to get out of the ambulance.

(h)He accepted the accuracy of his statement to police on the day of the incident that ""He connected with one so I tried to defend myself and punched him back above the left eye"".

(i)He denied the suggestions that the First Defendant was ""just swinging his arms around actually trying to prevent you from pulling him out of the ambulance"" and that his (Mr Martin's) face was injured as he was trying to pull the First Defendant forcefully out of the ambulance.

13There was no re-examination. Her Honour then questioned Mr Martin as to how well he knew the Kings Cross area and the apparent reason the First Defendant spat on the floor, including the following questions and answers:

""Q. Is the Court to understand that he actually spat on the floor apropos nothing?
A. Yes.

Q. Okay, and it was at that point that you called him a 'filthy pig'?
A. Yes.

Q. Would the Court be correct in inferring, Mr Martin, that you don't like blacks?
A. No.

Q. Are you sure about that? 
A. I'm positive.""


14The prosecutor then indicated that he wished to call Karen Jacobs as the next witness. The following exchange occurred:

""Her Honour: What's she going to tell the Court.

Prosecutor: She's the second ambulance officer.

Her Honour: I understand that I'm asking you what is she going to tell the court.

Prosecutor: What she saw.

Her Honour: So is it going to be substantially different than what I've heard already.

Edin: No your Honour.

Prosecutor: No your Honour.

Her Honour: Well there's no point in calling her unless you particularly want to cross-examine her about some specific aspect of her evidence.

Edin: No I don't - not many questions your Honour.

Prosecutor: If I can tender her statement then your Honour.

Her Honour: No point, I'm saying to you if it doesn't take the matter any further there is no point in receiving her evidence.""

15The Prosecutor next called Constable Hawes, who gave evidence in chief as follows:

(a)He had just finished work on 25 August 2011, and was driving along Ward Avenue in his personal vehicle, when he saw an ambulance parked on the side of the road at the intersection with Kings Cross Road, with its hazard lights on.

(b)He slowed down to go around the ambulance and, as he approached from behind, he saw a male ambulance officer being assaulted. Constable Hawes said ""As I slowed down and looked I saw the accused throwing, just throwing punches at the ambulance officer, he hit him twice that I saw. And I stopped the car, ran out of the vehicle and as I ran towards I saw the ambulance officer put his hands up to defend his head or to cover his head, and I saw the accused punch him another couple of times"".

(c)He saw two punches ""connect' with the ambulance officer, and he then got out of his car.

(d)He did not see the ambulance officer throw any punches. He saw the officer trying to protect his head.

(e)He had ""probably taken my eyes off them for five seconds"" while he stopped the car and emerged from the vehicle.

(f)The First Defendant was still swinging at the ambulance officer when Constable Hawes approached - ""I ran from my car and I grabbed the accused by the arm and put him on the ground. Leg sweeped him on the ground. When he got on the ground he started throwing, like thrashing around and whatever, ... wouldn't let me hold him down so me and the ambulance officer grabbed him and I put my weight on him to stop him, put him in a wrist lock to try and stop him from throwing his body around. Continued to do that and so me and the ambulance officer just sat and waited for him. Waited, waiting for police. I told him that I was a off duty police officer, that he was under arrest for assault. I didn't have a mobile phone on me so I couldn't call the police so I asked the female ambulance officer to make sure that she had called the police which she said that she had done"".

16Under cross-examination, Constable Hawes gave the following further evidence:

(a)He had completed a 12-hour shift and was feeling excited to be off work on the morning of 25 August 2011 because it was his first day of annual leave.

(b)He ""didn't see the ambulance officer throwing any punches. I only saw the accused"".

(c)He did not make any enquiries about whether the First Defendant was injured when he approached, at which time the First Defendant was still throwing punches at the ambulance officer - ""a guy's throwing punches, I didn't ask questions ... he was still very aggressive, he was still throwing punches at the ambulance officer. I wasn't going to stand there and figure out what was happening"".

17At the completion of the evidence of Constable Hawes, the prosecutor indicated to her Honour that he wished to call Ms Jacobs to tender some photographs. Ms Edin consented to their tender. Her Honour allowed the tender of two photographs (colour photographs of Mr Martin's face and hand which had previously been marked for identification and shown to Mr Martin). 

18Her Honour again said ""I don't want to hear from Ms Jacobs. She's not going to take the matter any further"".

19The prosecutor indicated that he wished to tender another photograph, not marked for identification, showing the spit on the ground inside the ambulance vehicle. The following exchange ensued:

""Her Honour: I don't think there's any contest about the fact that he spat in the ambulance van.

Prosecutor: However there were questions about blood being in the mouth, the spit on the photo doesn't show any blood.

Her Honour: Show me the photos. Just hold them up. Sorry, are they in colour?

Prosecutor: Yes it is, that's the spit.

Her Honour: That looks like black and white to me Sergeant.

Prosecutor: It is a colour photo your Honour, it is a good photo. ...

Her Honour: It looks like black and white to me.

Edin: It doesn't matter whether it was blood or not.

Her Honour: It's not to the point.

Prosecutor: Tender them your Honour.

Her Honour: I'm saying to you it's not to the point Sergeant, because it doesn't actually take the matters anywhere. Do you not understand that?

Prosecutor: I understand that.

Her Honour: I understand that your Honour.

Prosecutor: I understand that your Honour.

Her Honour: Thank you Sergeant. Let's focus on the elements in the offence, that's what you really have to focus on. There is no contest that the present accused spat in the ambulance van. Doesn't matter whether there was blood in it or not. Okay? It's not to the point.""

20The prosecutor then sought to call Senior Constable Jacqueline Largo, the officer in charge, who had attended the scene after police were called. The following discussion ensued:

""PROSECUTOR: I call Senior Constable Largo.

HER HONOUR: Is this the person who arrives on the scene after the present accused was-

PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour, she's the officer in charge.

HER HONOUR: -then swept to the ground and sat on?

PROSECUTOR: Yes, one of those two officers.

HER HONOUR: And what is she going to tell the Court?

PROSECUTOR: That she attended the scene, arrested the accused and conveyed the accused to the hospital.

HER HONOUR: And what does that tell us about any allegation of assault on Mr Martin?

PROSECUTOR: It doesn't.

HER HONOUR: No it doesn't, that's correct, so there's no point in calling her.

PROSECUTOR: Unless my friend wants to cross-examine her.

HER HONOUR: About what? Do you wish to cross-examine this officer, ma'am?

EDIN: No your Honour. But just in relation to the statement, I mean there are a number of things in there that my client is alleged to have said, which is neither here nor there.

HER HONOUR: No, because it's after the event.

HER HONOUR: And so anything allegedly said by him after the event, unless he makes some grand admission, is not to the point.

EDIN: That's correct, that would be my submission in relation to the tendering of the statement.

HER HONOUR: Thank you, yes. So what else do you have Sergeant?

PROSECUTOR: The two OIC who attended the scene later, it's the same your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Well it doesn't take the matter any further.""

21At this point, the Magistrate moved immediately to a discussion with the prosecutor. Her Honour did not confirm that the prosecutor had closed his case nor did the prosecutor state that he had done so. 

22No submission was made by the solicitor for the First Defendant. Indeed, Ms Edin was not called upon again by the Magistrate and did not participate in the hearing after the submission concerning the tender of the statement of Senior Constable Largo referred to at [20] above.

23Having regard to the grounds of appeal, and to allow an understanding as to what transpired at the hearing after evidence had been adduced, it is appropriate to set out the complete dialogue between her Honour and the prosecutor culminating in the dismissal of the charge:

HER HONOUR: The point is there's an incident long before - may not be terribly long before, but certainly before Constable Hawes arrived and saw something that he assumed to be something. But anyway, at this stage, given what I've heard from Mr Martin himself, particularly what occurred in the ambulance van, how do you say you can sustain this prosecution against this witness - or this accused?

PROSECUTOR: The Prosecution relies on the evidence given by Mr Martin who said he was assaulted outside the van, that the initial punch was, according to his evidence the initial punch was thrown by the defendant and as a result of that he raised his hand and punched back.

HER HONOUR: Can we go back a step. I think what Mr Martin told us was that the accused was ordered to get out of the van.

PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour.

HER HONOUR: 'Filthy pig', on account of having spat on the floor of the ambulance van, we've got that.

PROSECUTOR: Not just that, but--

HER HONOUR: No, no, I want you to stay with me Sergeant because we're going through the evidence. We need to get this evidence clear. Mr Martin demands that the present accused get out of the ambulance van, 'filthy pig' after the accused had spat on the floor of the ambulance van. Correct?

PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HER HONOUR: That was his evidence.

PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HER HONOUR: He was cross-examined about that aspect of his evidence. He was asked whether the accused had been in any way aggressive or violent towards him. Mr Martin quite clearly and distinctly denied that that was the situation. Is that clear that was his evidence?

PROSECUTOR: Yes. 

HER HONOUR: He was specifically asked about the spitting. He was asked whether the accused had spat at him and he said 'no'. Nevertheless, he demanded that the accused get out of the - 'pig' - out of the ambulance van and at the same time he called his derogatory name. Is that clear? 

PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HER HONOUR: The next piece of evidence we have is that the accused refused to do so. He kept saying 'Are you professionals, my jaw is hurting'. Yes, he might have said 'My fucking jaw is hurting' -but I hardly think that that's anything of any moment for anyone, including Mr Martin - and demands to be taken to hospital. Correct?

PROSECUTOR: Mm, mm. 

HER HONOUR: That's the evidence, correct?

PROSECUTOR: That is the evidence.

HER HONOUR: Okay. So, then Martin attempts to drag him out of the van and - correct?

PROSECUTOR: He didn't say he attempts to take him out of the vehicle, he merely says he assisted him getting out of the vehicle.

HER HONOUR: I'm sorry, he is attempting to drag him out of the van because as he quite clearly told the Court and I'm relying on Mr Martin's evidence, I'm not there, remember, but don't get some different - don't formulate in your own mind something that he didn't say. What he said was the accused was refusing to get out of the van. And if Martin says he assisted him to get out of the van and the accused doesn't want to get out of the van, Sergeant, let's be fair dinkum. You're a police officer, I'm just a lawyer. Let's be fair dinkum, he was attempting to drag him out of the van. And then a struggle ensued. Correct? That was the evidence, Sergeant, you accept that? That was the evidence, Sergeant.

PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Frankly Sergeant, I don't think you've got a case.

PROSECUTOR: Because--

HER HONOUR: Because, who initiated this physical interaction? Mr Martin did. And on his own evidence no good cause. You will remember that the Bench addressed some questions to him after the Bench had heard his evidence-in-chief and the cross-examination. He demanded of the accused the accused get out of the ambulance van, on his evidence, after the accused, according to him, spat on the floor of the van. There is no dispute about the accused spitting on the floor of the van. It doesn't matter whether there was blood in it or not, the accused spat on the floor of the van, no contest about that. But nothing in that situation, according to Martin himself, which was aggressive towards him or violent towards him in any way. To the contrary, the accused kept saying to him, 'My fucking jaw hurts, take me to hospital.' That was Martin's evidence. So then, after the accused spits on the floor of the van he says, 'Get out of my ambulance, filthy pig' - 'I don't want you in my van' was what he actually said. And then, because the accused doesn't want to get out of the van Martin drags him out. You do not have a case, Sergeant.

The information is dismissed.""

Grounds of Appeal

24The Plaintiff's primary claim for relief is by way of appeal under s.56(1)(c) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. That provision confines a prosecutor seeking to challenge an order of acquittal in summary criminal proceedings to a ground that involves a question of law alone. An appeal is not available on a ground of appeal that involves a question of fact or a mixed question of fact and law: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402 at 411-412 [58]-[62].

25The Plaintiff relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a)Ground 1 - Her Honour failed to accord procedural fairness to the prosecution by not permitting the prosecutor to call the witnesses Karen Jacobs and Senior Constable Largo or to tender a photograph (the spit photograph).

(b)Ground 2 - Her Honour failed to inform herself of the substance of evidence before rejecting the tender of a photograph (the spit photograph), by rejecting its tender without properly viewing it.

(c)Ground 3 - Her Honour dismissed the matter before the prosecutor had formally closed the prosecution case.

(d)Ground 4 - Her Honour dismissed the matter in circumstances where there was a failure to properly consider whether there was a prima facie case.

(e)Ground 5 - Her Honour did not provide adequate reasons for her determination to dismiss the proceedings.

26The alternative claim for prerogative relief relies upon the same grounds in the event that, for some reason, statutory appellate relief was not available to the Plaintiff in the circumstances of the case.

Assault under s.61 Crimes Act 1900

27Before turning to consider the Plaintiff's claim for relief, it is useful to refer to some basic concepts relevant to a charge of assault. 

28An offence of assault under s.61 Crimes Act 1900 is punishable by imprisonment for two years when tried on indictment or, if tried summarily, imprisonment for 12 months or a fine of 20 penalty units or both.

29The legal ingredients of the crime of assault (sometimes described as common assault) were considered in McIntyre v R [2009] NSWCCA 305; 198 A Crim R 549, where it was said at 558 [40]-[42]:

""[40] What is an assault? The traditional common law distinction between assault and battery has largely fallen away for the purpose of application of the modern law of assault. The distinction between assault and battery noted that an assault is an act which causes another person to apprehend the infliction of immediate unlawful force on his or her person, and a battery is the actual infliction of unlawful force on another person: R v Knight (1988) 35 A Crim R 314 at 316-317. Where the assault takes the form of a battery, what is required is an intentional touching of the victim without that person's consent and without lawful excuse: Fitzgerald v Kennard (1995) 38 NSWLR 184 at 192 and 200.

[41] A practical distinction is sometimes drawn between a physical assault (or battery assault) and psychic assault (or apprehended unlawful force assault): Fitzgerald v Kennard at 200-201; Mikhael v Conroy (Finlay J, 6 December 1990, unreported, BC9002962 at p 8-15); Lake Macquarie City Council v Morris (2005) 63 NSWLR 263 at 273-274 [48]-[49].

[42] It is not an element of the crime of assault that injury be caused to the victim. Any touching of another person, however slight, may amount to a physical assault. It has been said that the law cannot draw the line between different degrees of violence, and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it: Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB (Marion's Case) [1991]-[1992] 175 CLR 218 at 233 and 265-266; Collins v Wilcock [1984] 1 WLR 1172 at 1177.""

30A series of related events during an incident may give rise to a single offence of assault, even where each act may be capable itself of constituting a separate offence of assault: Mikhael v Conroy (Finlay J, 6 December 1990, BC9002962 at pages 13-14); Lake Macquarie City Council v Morris [2005] NSWSC 387; 63 NSWLR 263 at 273-274 [48]-[49]; Colquhoun v Magistrate Guy [2010] NSWSC 235 at [45]. 

31It was accepted before me that the charge of assault here focused upon the alleged blow by the First Defendant to Mr Martin's face, whilst both men were outside the ambulance, with that blow leaving marks depicted in a photograph which was admitted into evidence in the Local Court (the incident referred to at [11](m) above). However, the evidence of events before and after that particular event were relevant to an understanding of what occurred between the First Defendant and Mr Martin, and to allow a proper determination of the charge. 

32There was no reference whatsoever in the Local Court to the concept of self defence, let alone the provisions contained in ss.418, 419 and 422 Crimes Act 1900. 

33It was submitted in writing for the First Defendant that the basis of dismissal of the charge lay in the application of principles of self defence to the circumstances of this case. As will be apparent from the dialogue between the prosecutor and the Bench set out above, which contains what are said to be the reasons of the Magistrate, these provisions and this principle were not referred to at the hearing. At no point did Ms Edin advance such a submission or, indeed, any submission at all as to why the charge ought be dismissed. 

34At the hearing before me, Mr Smith did not press the submission that this Court should conclude that self defence played any part in the dismissal of the charge. Accordingly, there is no need to consider how self defence could possibly arise here, or to address the requirements of ss.418, 419 and 422 Crimes Act 1900 and the principles in decisions such as R v Katarzynski [2002] NSWSC 613, Douglas v R [2005] NSWCCA 419 and Colosimo v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2006] NSWCCA 293 at [19], as to the ways in which self defence may be raised in a criminal trial.
 
The Conduct of a Criminal Trial by a Judge of Magistrate Sitting Alone

35Before moving to consider the precise grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to set out some general principles applicable to the conduct of a criminal trial for a summary offence before a Magistrate sitting in the Local Court of New South Wales. These principles emerge from an examination of relevant statutory provisions, together with general principles surrounding the conduct of a criminal trial. The resolution of this appeal will involve an assessment whether the Magistrate complied with these legal principles, and the consequences of any departure from them.

36As both the prosecutor and the First Defendant appeared on the date fixed for hearing, the duty of the Magistrate was to proceed to hear and determine the matter: s.192(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

37As the First Defendant had pleaded not guilty to the charge, s.194 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 applied:

""194 Procedure if offence not admitted

(1) If the accused person pleads not guilty or fails or refuses to make a plea or the court does not accept the accused person's guilty plea, the court must proceed to hear and determine the matter.

(2) The court must hear the prosecutor, any witnesses and other evidence of the prosecutor and must hear the accused person and any witnesses and other evidence of the accused person.""

38Section 195 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides for the manner in which evidence is taken:

""195 How evidence is taken

(1) A prosecutor may give evidence and may examine and cross-examine the witnesses giving evidence for the prosecution or the accused person, respectively.

(2) An accused person may make full answer and defence. An accused person may give evidence and may examine and cross-examine the witnesses giving evidence for the accused person or the prosecution, respectively.

(3) If the accused person gives any evidence or examines any witness as to any matter other than as to the witness's general character, the prosecutor may call and examine witnesses in reply.""

39At the conclusion of the evidence, a Magistrate must comply with s.202 Criminal Procedure Act 1986:

""202 Determination by court

(1) The court must determine summary proceedings after hearing the accused person, prosecutor, witnesses and evidence in accordance with this Act.

(2) The court may determine the matter by convicting the accused person or making an order as to the accused person, or by dismissing the matter.

(3) In the case of a matter heard in the absence of the accused person, the court may adjourn the proceedings to enable the accused person to appear or be brought before the court for sentencing.""


40Of course, the progress of a hearing will depend upon the issues arising for determination during the trial, including the question as to whether, as a matter of law, there is no prima facie case at the close of the prosecution case. This involves application of well-recognised principles: Director of Prosecutions v Elskaf [2012] NSWSC 21 at [47]. If there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the tribunal of fact in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left for decision by the tribunal of fact. A verdict of not guilty may be entered at the conclusion of the prosecution case only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty: Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 212, 214-215. The principle remains the same whether application is made for an acquittal at the end of the prosecution case where trial is proceeding before Judge and jury, or where trial is proceeding before a Judge or Magistrate sitting alone. 

41The duty of a trial Judge, whether sitting with a jury or sitting alone, has been repeatedly stated and is well understood. In Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; 206 CLR 161, Gleeson CJ said at 173 [19]:

""Fifthly, in a common law system the adversarial procedure is bound up with notions of judicial independence and impartiality. A criminal trial is conducted before a judge (sitting with or without a jury) who has taken no part in the investigation of the offence, or in the decision to prosecute the offender, or in the framing of the charge, or in the selection of the witnesses to be called on either side of the case, and whose capacity to intervene in the conduct of the trial is limited. One of the objects of a system which leaves it to the parties to define the issues, and to select the evidence and arguments upon which they will rely, is to preserve the neutrality of the decision-making tribunal. Courts are hesitant to compromise features of the adversarial system which have implications fundamental to the administration of justice.""

42A criminal trial is not an inquisition. It is for the parties to act as protagonists in the trial with the judge to ""take no part in that contest, having his [or her] own role to perform in ensuring the propriety and fairness of the trial and in instructing the jury in the relevant law"": Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 at 517 (Barwick CJ). 

43These principles have been stated repeatedly in decisions such as Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Burns [2010] NSWCA 265; 207 A Crim R 362 at 369 [28].

44In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Yeo [2008] NSWSC 953; 188 A Crim R 82, the Court said at 95-96 [58]:

""Criminal proceedings are conducted as adversarial litigation: Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614 at 618-619 [9]. The role of the presiding Judge is to hold the balance between the contending parties without himself or herself taking part in their disputation. The Judge does not exercise an inquisitorial role in which he or she seeks to remedy the deficiencies in the case of either side, nor is part of the function of a Judge to don the mantle of prosecution or defence counsel: Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 682. The fundamental task of a Judge is to ensure a fair trial: R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [76]; Robinson v R (2006) 162 A Crim R 88 at [138]-[140]. Although these observations were made concerning the role of the Judge in a jury criminal trial, I consider that they are equally applicable to Magistrates hearing and determining criminal proceedings in the Local Court, whether defended hearings or sentence proceedings following a plea of guilty.""

45If the defence objects to the prosecution calling a particular witness or witnesses or adducing certain evidence from a witness or objects to the tender of physical evidence, then the Judge or Magistrate should ascertain the basis of the objection for the purpose of ruling whether the evidence ought be allowed. If necessary and appropriate for the purpose of ruling on the objection, evidence may be given on the voir dire even if proceedings are without a jury: s.189 Evidence Act 1995; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Zhang [2007] NSWSC 308; 48 MVR 78 at [107]-[112].

46The Evidence Act 1995 applies in an adversarial context. It is the parties who define the issues at trial, select the witnesses, and choose the evidence that they will lead, and to which they will take objection: Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1 at 9 [20] (Gleeson CJ and Hayne J).

47There is no obligation on a trial judge to reject evidence under s.137 Evidence Act 1995 to which no objection has been taken: R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317 at 651-653 [23]-[30]. This reflects the role of the judge in adversarial proceedings. A statutory exception to this general principle is s.41 Evidence Act 1995 which requires a judge to reject an improper question whether or not objection has been taken: R v FDP at 652 [28]-[30] (concerning s.275A Criminal Procedure Act 1986 which is now to be found in s.41 Evidence Act 1995).

48A prosecutor at a criminal trial (including a police prosecutor) is under a duty to lead the whole of the evidence to which the accused is required to make answer: Dhanhoa v The Queen at 9 [20]. The duty of the prosecutor with respect to the calling of witnesses is well known: R v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 450; 47 NSWLR 450 at 457-462 [39]-[56].

49There has been increased recognition of the appropriateness of case-management powers being vested in trial Judges to reduce delays in proceedings and to promote efficient and fair criminal trials. Sections 134-149F Criminal Procedure Act 1986 contain provisions intended to reduce delays in proceedings on indictment before the Supreme and District Courts. Sections 247A-247Y Criminal Procedure Act 1986 contain case-management provisions applicable to proceedings before the Supreme Court or the Land and Environment Court in their summary jurisdictions, which are intended to reduce delays in summary proceedings before those Courts.

50There is no equivalent statutory regime in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 applicable to summary hearings in the Local Court. However, for some years, there have been procedures for service of prosecution witness statements to the defence in advance of the hearing, with the intention of assisting the efficient, speedy and fair determination of a summary hearing: Director of Public Prosecutions v West [2000] NSWCA 103; 48 NSWLR 647 at 654-655 [22]-[23]. Provision is now made by way of a Practice Note issued by the Chief Magistrate for case management of criminal proceedings in the Local Court: ss.26(2)(a) and 27 Local Court Act 2007; Local Court Practice Note Crim 1 (issued 24 April 2012), in particular at clauses 5.2, 5.7. Although this Practice Note was issued after the hearing relevant to this case, it reflects the practice (and its rationale) which has been in place for some time.

51The role of the Judge in a contemporary criminal trial does not require that the Judge sit ""as inscrutable as the Sphinx"" until the time comes for judgment to be given: Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48; 201 CLR 488 at 493 [13]. The rules governing the conduct of a criminal trial are ""not frozen in time"" with regard to be had to the demands of contemporary criminal litigation: cf Johnson v Johnson at 493 [13].

52However, the necessity for the trial Judge to ensure that a fair trial takes place remains as a bedrock rule, with the Court's obligation to ensure procedural fairness extending to the prosecutor as well as the defence: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v O'Conner [2006] NSWSC 458; 181 A Crim R 294 at 318 [80]; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Chaouk [2010] NSWSC 1418 at [48]-[52].

53The Court of Criminal Appeal has acknowledged that, in appropriate circumstances, a Judge sitting in a trial without a jury, will be entitled, within reasonable limits, to explore issues of fact with both prosecution and defence witnesses and that this may reflect the contemporary desire for efficient and effective use of court time, whilst at the same time ensuring that a fair trial takes place: FB v R [2011] NSWCCA 217 at [84]-[110]; R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442 at 468-473, 477-478.

54Where a Magistrate determines to dismiss a charge, whether on the ground of no prima facie case or because, on all the evidence, the Magistrate is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused person, then there is an obligation for the Magistrate to give reasons for that decision. Likewise, if the Magistrate determines to find the accused person guilty of the offence.

55The provision of reasons for a decision is, amongst other things, an expression of the open justice principle. The centrality, to the judicial function, of a public explanation of reasons for final decisions has long been recognised: Wainohu v State of New South Wales [2011] HCA 24; 243 CLR 181 at 213-215 [54]-[58].

56There is no provision applicable to Magistrates such as s.133 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which applies to trial by Judge alone on indictment. Nevertheless, it is part of the Magistrate's duty to state the facts found and the legal principles applied to those facts, for the purpose of reaching a verdict: Donges v Ratcliffe [1975] 1 NSWLR 501 at 507. In Moloney v Collins [2011] NSWSC 628, the Court said at [63]-[65] (in the context of a civil hearing in the Local Court):

""63Failure to give reasons as required by law may itself disclose error of law: Pettitt v Dunkley [1971] 1 NSWLR 376; Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 278-279. However, the extent and content of the reasons required will depend upon the particular case and the issues under consideration. 

64The duty does not require the trial Judge to spell out in minute detail every step in the reasoning process or refer to every single piece of evidence. It is sufficient if the reasons adequately reveal the basis of the decision, expressing the specific findings that are critical to the determination of the proceedings: Stoker v Adecco Gemvale Constructions Pty Limited [2004] NSWCA 449 at 41. It is essential to expose the reasoning on a point critical to the contest between the parties: Pollard v RRR Corporation Pty Limited [2009] NSWCA 110 at [58].

65Appropriate allowance should be made for the pressures under which Magistrates are placed by the volume of cases coming before them: Director of Public Prosecutions v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402 at 407-408 [15]-[18]."" 

57Judges of this Court have emphasised repeatedly the obligation upon a Magistrate to give reasons for a decision in criminal proceedings in discharge of the Magistrate's judicial duties, whilst keeping in mind the practical reality of delivery of ex tempore reasons in a busy court: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited at 407-408 [15]-[19]; Munro v ACP [2012] NSWSC 100 at [21]-[23]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Sukhera [2012] NSWSC 311 at [16]-[17] and Director of Public Prosecutions v Langford [2012] NSWSC 310 at [33].
 
58In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited, I observed at 408 [18]-[19]:

""18One of the conventional functions of the requirement to give reasons is that a statement of reasons may be necessary to enable a party to exercise a right of appeal or such other rights as the party may have to contest the decision: Pettitt v Dunkley (1971) 1 NSWLR 376, 387, 388; Donges v Ratcliffe (1975) 1 NSWLR 501 at 507; Housing Commission of NSW v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Limited (1983) 3 NSWLR 378 at 386. The defendant and the prosecutor have a statutory right of appeal to this Court under the Appeal and Review Act arising from the determination of criminal proceedings in the Local Court. 

19It is not satisfactory that an appeal court is left to undertake an analysis of exchanges between the bench and counsel during submissions in an attempt to ascertain a magistrate's reasons for determination: R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at paragraph 11; R v Thompson (2005) 156 A Crim R 467 at 474-5 (paragraph 32). The provision of concise reasons as required by law will avoid this circumstance occurring. It is necessary that magistrates keep in mind the obligation to provide reasons when determining summary proceedings under s.202 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.""

59It is helpful to mention the rationale underlying the judicial function and the duty to give reasons.

60In a paper entitled ""The Role of a Judge in a Representative Democracy"" (2008) 9 The Judicial Review 19, the Hon AM Gleeson AC identified constraints upon judicial authority by reference to precedent, the adversarial process and the duty to give reasons. With respect to precedent, his Honour said at 26:

""A court that does not respect precedent undermines its own authority, for it will produce nothing by which its successors will regard themselves as bound. Judicial disregard for precedent is self-destructive.""




61His Honour touched upon the significance of giving reasons at 31:

""The best evidence of what judges consider their role to be is the way in which they seek to justify their decisions. Reasons for judicial decisions are directed at an audience which includes other judges, the legal profession, the parties to litigation, and the public. The kinds of argument advanced in support of such reasons reflect the judicial perception of the judicial function, and the judicial understanding of the public perception of that function.""

62The Hon AM Gleeson AC returned to the function of reasons in a later paper, entitled ""The Judicial Method: Essentials and Inessentials"" (2010) 9 The Judicial Review 377 at 384:

""The third essential is giving reasons for a decision. Reasons serve a number of purposes. They promote good decision-making by requiring a decision-maker to explain and justify an outcome. They inform a losing party of the reason for failure. They allow an appellate court to identify possible error and correct possible injustice. They inform the public of the way judicial power is exercised. The adequacy of a statement of reasons for a decision is judged by reference to these purposes.""

63The former Chief Justice touched upon another important principle at 387:

""It is a corollary of the rule of law that, in the administration of civil or criminal justice, the outcome of a case should depend as little as reasonably possible upon the random factor of the identity of the judicial decision maker.""

64Apart from the traditional reasons underpinning the requirement for reasons to be given for judicial decisions, Meagher JA identified in Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 at 442 a further benefit from the requirement:

""The requirement to provide reasons can operate prophylactically on the judicial mind, guarding against the birth of an unconsidered or impulsive decision. It enhances judicial accountability.""

65In a similar vein, it has been observed that, as a general rule, people who know that their decisions are open to scrutiny, and who are obliged to explain them, are more likely to make reasonable decisions: AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at 470 [89]; Wainohu v State of New South Wales at 214-215 [56]. 

66It is now appropriate to turn to the grounds of appeal to measure what happened in this case against these principles.

Ground 1 - Failure to Accord Procedural Fairness to the Prosecution by Not Permitting the Prosecutor to Call Witnesses or to Tender a Photograph

Submissions of the Parties

67Ms Adams submitted that her Honour had failed to comply with the obligation to accord procedural fairness by not allowing the prosecutor to call Ms Jacobs and Senior Constable Jacqueline Largo to give evidence and to allow the tender of the photograph depicting spit on the floor of the ambulance. 

68Reliance was placed upon a number of decisions, including Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Elskaf, Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald [2004] NSWSC 182 and Slade v Gea [2001] NSWSC 38 in support of the submission that the Magistrate erred in this respect.

69With respect to the evidence of Ms Jacobs, Ms Adams submitted that there was a strong basis to suggest that her testimony was likely to be relevant as it concerned her observations and actions in a period in and around the ambulance when the alleged assault occurred.

70Ms Adams submitted that Senior Constable Largo's statement contained more than just statements made by the First Defendant and that the Magistrate ought not to have effectively prevented the prosecutor from calling her as a witness.

71It was submitted for the Plaintiff that the Magistrate had denied the prosecution the opportunity to present its case, exceeding the proper functions of a presiding judicial officer in defended criminal proceedings, when she summarily declined to permit the prosecutor to call Ms Jacobs and by peremptorily closing off the calling of Senior Constable Largo.

72With respect to the tender of the photograph, Ms Adams submitted that the prosecutor sought to tender it and that it appeared to be capable of bearing upon an issue in the proceedings, namely whether the First Defendant's spitting was gratuitous or, in some way, associated with some medical problem.

73Mr Smith accepted that the Magistrate was under a duty to act fairly and to accord procedural fairness to both parties to the proceedings. With respect to the evidence of Ms Jacobs, Mr Smith submitted that the Magistrate did not fail to allow the prosecutor to call her or, alternatively, even if the Magistrate did prevent the prosecutor from calling Ms Jacobs as a witness, the failure did not constitute a denial of procedural fairness.

74It was submitted for the First Defendant that the prosecutor had agreed that the evidence of Ms Jacobs was not substantially different from the evidence of Mr Martin, so that it was open to the Magistrate to conclude that it would not advance the prosecution case. Mr Smith sought to distinguish Director of Public Prosecutions v Elskaf and Slade v Gea. He submitted that the present case was one where there was an implied concession that the evidence of Ms Jacobs would not advance the case of the party seeking to call it.

75With respect to the evidence of Senior Constable Largo, it was submitted that the nature of her evidence was made sufficiently clear so that the Magistrate was in a position to properly rule upon its admissibility: Minh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 86 FCR 304 at 314-315. It was submitted that the prosecutor had effectively conceded that the evidence of Senior Constable Largo would not advance the prosecution case.

76With respect to the tender of the photograph, Mr Smith submitted that no denial of procedural fairness had occurred in the circumstances of this case as it was clear that defence counsel before the Magistrate had stated that no reliance was to be placed upon the spit having blood in it in the determination of the case.

77In these various ways, the First Defendant submitted that no denial of procedural fairness had occurred in this case. 

Decision

78The starting point involves recognition of the function of a Judge presiding in criminal proceedings, as referred to earlier in this judgment. This function has been emphasised and re-emphasised in decisions of this Court in proceedings on appeal from the Magistrate in this case: Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald; Director of Public Prosecutions v Yeo; Director of Public Prosecutions v Elskaf. The relevant principles are clear and their application ought give rise to no difficulty.

79There was no identification by defence counsel at the outset of the hearing or at any other time in the hearing (apart from what could be inferred from cross-examination of the two witnesses called) as to what the issues were said to be in the proceedings. This is not intended as a criticism of the lawyer appearing for the First Defendant in the Local Court. However, it assists an understanding of what actually occurred in the Local Court, where the Magistrate sought to effectively control the hearing with a rush to judgment, without any submission being made on behalf of the defence concerning the issues in the case, the appropriate course which the Court should take and with the Court exercising its judicial functions in accordance with law in that context.

80It must be said that the prosecutor's intention to call Ms Jacobs, who was clearly capable of giving relevant evidence in the proceedings, and Senior Constable Largo, the officer in charge of the case who was able to give evidence of what the First Defendant said, was entirely understandable. These were witnesses of a class commonly called to give evidence in defended criminal proceedings. This was certainly not a case of undue repetition from witnesses on issues not in dispute (such as surveillance witnesses). It is noteworthy that the First Defendant's lawyer in the Local Court indicated an objection to the tender of the statements of the various witnesses and a desire to cross-examine the witnesses if called. 

81In my view, Ms Jacobs was able to give relevant evidence in the proceedings. The prosecutor did not withdraw the tender of her evidence. With respect, it was not for the Magistrate to take over the control of the prosecution by demanding from the prosecutor a justification as to why Ms Jacobs ought be allowed to be called in the prosecution case. At the commencement of the Local Court hearing, Ms Edin objected to the tender of the witness statement of Ms Jacobs. However, there was no defence submission that Ms Jacobs would give no relevant evidence.

82Even if it be the case that Ms Jacobs had not witnessed directly the precise stage of the incident at which the first blow was struck, it is clear that she had been involved in the initial attendance upon the First Defendant and his placement in the ambulance, together with subsequent events which involved (without challenge in cross-examination) the First Defendant throwing the patient health care record and hitting Ms Jacobs on the leg, with Ms Jacobs thereafter calling the police for assistance. All of this, without more, demonstrates the ability of Ms Jacobs to give evidence relevant to the proceedings. She was, in reality, a type of eyewitness present in the ambulance when events occurred between the First Defendant and Mr Martin. In my view, the prosecutor was bound to call Ms Jacobs to give evidence and her Honour was bound to allow the prosecutor to do so.

83However, there is a further and particular vice which arises from the basis upon which the Magistrate ultimately (and apparently) came to determine the matter. If, as appears to be the case, her Honour rejected Mr Martin as a witness of truth in areas that, in the mind of the Magistrate, were relevant to the determination of the case, then Ms Jacobs was capable of giving evidence on a range of issues which may have served to corroborate the account given by Mr Martin. 

84I do not accept the submissions on behalf of the First Defendant that, in some way, the prosecutor had acquiesced in the view that Ms Jacobs could not give relevant evidence in the proceedings. The prosecutor should not have been placed in the position he was by the Magistrate. In circumstances where there was no objection from the defence to Ms Jacobs giving evidence (as to which the Magistrate would be called upon to rule), compliance with ss.194 and 195 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and general principles concerning the conduct of a criminal trial, required the Magistrate to allow the prosecutor to call Ms Jacobs to give evidence in the prosecution case. The Plaintiff has established that it was a denial of procedural fairness (and an error of law) to prevent this happening.

85The position with respect to Senior Constable Largo is a little different. She was not an eyewitness to the incident and came to the scene only after the intervention of Constables Hawes. However, as the officer in charge of the case, Senior Constable Largo had spoken to the First Defendant and was in a position to give evidence of observations at the scene, together with the process of arrest and charging of the First Defendant. On the face of it, all of this evidence would appear to be relevant. If it was not controversial, the statement of Senior Constable Largo could be tendered, although defence counsel in the Local Court objected to this course. I do not accept that a fair reading of what occurred in the Local Court involved an acceptance by the prosecutor that Senior Constable Largo could give no relevant evidence at the hearing.

86Once again, I accept the submission of the Plaintiff that the Magistrate has denied procedural fairness to the prosecutor in the Local Court (and erred in law) by preventing the calling of this evidence, although its significance to the prosecution case may be somewhat less to that of Ms Jacobs.

87The tender of the photograph depicting the inside of the ambulance attracted some discussion with the Magistrate concerning the nature of the photograph, and whether it was colour or black and white. It is clear that the photograph is a colour photograph, as a close examination of the photograph would have readily demonstrated. 

88The photograph was capable of bearing on a fact in issue in the proceedings: s.55 Evidence Act 1995. The fact that defence counsel in the Local Court did not wish to advance an argument by reference to the absence of blood in the spit on the floor of the ambulance was not a reason for rejecting out of hand the tender of the photograph. There had been cross-examination of Mr Martin on this issue. The photograph represented a form of contemporaneous evidence on an issue about which the prosecutor wished to advance a submission to the Magistrate. 

89Although this aspect is of lesser importance to the Magistrate's prevention of the calling of Ms Jacobs, it is, in the circumstances of the case, not insignificant. I am persuaded as well that the approach of the Magistrate as to the use of the photograph discloses denial of procedural fairness.

90In reaching these conclusions concerning the first ground of appeal, I have kept in mind the desirability of appropriate case management of a hearing by the presiding Magistrate. However, what happened here did not involve appropriate case management. The actions of the Magistrate deprived the prosecution of a fair trial of the charge against the First Defendant.
 
Ground 2 - Failure to Inform Herself of the Substance of the Evidence Before Rejecting the Tender of the Spit Photograph

Submissions of the Parties

91Ms Adams submitted that when a court is required to rule on an objection to the admissibility of evidence, it must first inform itself of the nature of the evidence: Director of Public Prosecutions v CAD [2003] NSWSC 196 at [42].

92It was submitted for the Plaintiff that the Magistrate's rejection of the tender of the photograph, without adequately informing herself about it, disclosed error.

93Mr Smith submitted that it was sufficient that the Magistrate invited the prosecutor to hold up the photograph, with the concession by defence counsel below that it did not matter whether or not there was blood in the spit or not. In these circumstances, it was submitted that error had not been established in the approach taken by the Magistrate to this aspect.

Decision

94This ground is associated with the third aspect of the first ground of appeal concerning the Magistrate's approach to the tender of the photograph depicting spit on the floor of the ambulance.

95I have already expressed my view that the circumstances surrounding the tender of this photograph, and its rejection, constitutes a form of denial of procedural fairness. This is sufficient to give rise to an error of law for the purpose of s.56(1)(c) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. 

96It is not necessary to rule separately on the second ground of appeal in these circumstances.

Ground 3 - Dismissing the Matter Before the Prosecutor had Formally Closed the Prosecution Case

Submissions of the Parties

97Ms Adams relied upon the statement of Sully J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald at [23]-[24] that a Magistrate is obliged to establish clearly whether the prosecutor had in fact closed his case and that this step is no mere formality. 

98It was submitted that the failure of the Magistrate to take this step was erroneous, with what followed involving a rushed process where the Magistrate did not state the decision that was being made other than the fact that the charge was being dismissed. Ms Adams submitted that this was a breach of the requirement of procedural fairness in the same way as has occurred in Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald.

99Mr Smith submitted that it was clear enough that the prosecutor had closed his case as there was no further witness to be called. In this way, it was clear that the submissions that were being made were occurring in the context of the prosecution case being closed. 

100Accordingly, it was submitted that the ground of appeal had not been made out.

Decision

101Sully J observed in Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald that the closure of the prosecution case is no formality. I agree with that statement. 

102The statement that the prosecution has closed its case provides the temporal context for a submission (if any) that there is no prima facie case. The failure of the Magistrate in this case to draw that line in the procedural sand was followed here by an immediate debate, without any defence application, between the Magistrate and the prosecutor concerning the charge. There was no identification of the elements of the offence, nor any articulation of the legal principles which may bear upon the determination of the proceedings, let alone any coherent findings of fact. Instead, there was a brief exchange followed by the dismissal of the charge.

103In my view, what happened in this case fortifies a conclusion that error of law has been demonstrated in the ways contended in the fourth and fifth grounds. 

104It is not necessary to say more concerning this separate ground of appeal.

Ground 4 - Dismissing the Matter in Circumstances Where the Magistrate Failed to Properly Consider Whether There Was a Prima Facie Case

Submissions of the Parties

105Ms Adams submitted that the Magistrate failed to apply the appropriate test on the question whether a prima facie had been established. Counsel submitted that it is difficult to identify the reasoning process by which her Honour concluded that there was apparently no prima facie case and that the charge ought be dismissed. Ms Adams submitted that, as best as it can be discerned from the transcript, the basis for her Honour's dismissal of the charge appears to be as follows:

(a)Mr Martin ""was attempting to drag [the First Defendant] out of the van. And then a struggle ensued"";

(b)Mr Martin ""initiated this physical interaction ... on his own evidence [for] no good cause"";

(c)there was ""nothing in that situation, according to Mr Martin himself, which was aggressive towards him or violent towards him in any way"";

(d)""and then, because the accused doesn't want to get out of the van Martin drags him out"".

106Ms Adams submitted that these remarks indicated that her Honour failed to apply the correct test for determining whether a prima facie case had been made out. Even if Mr Martin ""dragged"" the First Defendant out of the ambulance (which was not conceded), it was not clear why this would mean that there was no evidence which, if accepted, could amount to proof that the First Defendant assaulted Mr Martin. 

107It was submitted that there was nothing in the transcript to indicate any legal justification for the First Defendant punching Mr Martin once he was outside the ambulance. If her Honour took the view that the First Defendant was acting in self defence, it was submitted that not only was this contrary to the evidence before the Local Court, but her Honour erred in dismissing the charge on that basis.

108Ms Adams submitted that, instead of taking all of the prosecution evidence at its highest and strongest when considering whether the First Defendant could lawfully be convicted of assault, her Honour failed to consider, or reject, the prosecution evidence that the First Defendant initiated the contact with Mr Martin outside the ambulance, which formed the basis for the charge. It was submitted that this evidence consisted of Mr Martin's testimony that the First Defendant started swinging punches at him and the evidence of Constable Hawes that the First Defendant was throwing punches at Mr Martin, but that he did not see Mr Martin reciprocate. 

109Ms Adams submitted that it appears that her Honour either failed to consider, or rejected, all of the other prosecution evidence concerning the First Defendant's aggression, including:

(a)Mr Martin's repeated statements in evidence-in-chief and cross-examination that the First Defendant was behaving ""aggressively"" inside and outside the ambulance, that he did not feel safe in the back of the ambulance with the First Defendant and that he felt ""abused"" and ""threatened"";

(b)Mr Martin's evidence that the First Defendant threw an icepack which hit him on the head, and a patient health care record book which hit Ms Jacobs on the leg;

(c)Mr Martin's evidence that the First Defendant said something along the lines of ""I haven't been in a fight tonight, maybe I should get out and fight you""; and

(d)Constable Hawes' evidence-in-chief, and in cross-examination, that the First Defendant was ""aggressive"" and throwing punches at Mr Martin.

110The Plaintiff submitted that her Honour's comment during the exchange with the prosecutor - ""Let's be fair dinkum"" about Mr Martin's evidence - strongly suggested that she did not accept parts of his evidence. Ms Adams submitted that the Magistrate misstated Mr Martin's evidence when she said that he ""quite clearly and distinctly denied"" that the First Defendant ""had been in anyway aggressive or violent towards him"". In cross-examination, Mr Martin conceded that the First Defendant did not threaten or spit at him, but that there was no reasonable basis for her Honour to conclude that Mr Martin ""clearly and distinctly denied"" that the First Defendant had been aggressive towards him.

111Ms Adams submitted that her Honour had committed the error identified by Howie J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Lee [2006] NSWSC 270 at [32], and by Garling J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Elskaf at [52], by confusing two entirely separate questions. The first question is a question of law - whether there was evidence which, if accepted, could amount to proof of the offence. The second question is one of fact, arising only if there is a prima facie case, whether her Honour judged the evidence given to be reliable and acceptable, such that she could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence could be made out. The Plaintiff submitted that a failure to address these separate questions in a precise and legally correct way was itself sufficient to warrant the grant of relief: Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald at [30].

112The Plaintiff submitted that her Honour's ""Let's be fair dinkum"" and ""no good cause"" comments suggested that she erroneously mixed her assessment of the weight, credibility or reliability of Mr Martin's evidence with her determination of the prima facie case issue, with the phrases used dealing with the reliability of the evidence and its acceptability not being the equivalent of the applicable legal test: Director of Public Prosecutions v Elskaf at [53]. 

113Ms Adams submitted that this is not a case where the evidence of Mr Martin could be reasonably regarded as being inherently incredible such that it could be excluded on the question of law as to a prima facie case. If that was the view which her Honour took, the Plaintiff submitted that there was no reasonable or proper basis for it on the evidence before the Local Court.

114The Plaintiff submitted that it was the evidence of Mr Martin in cross-examination that, as the First Defendant ""started to get out of the ambulance"", he ""had him by the arm ... underneath the arm"", that this was ""like I do with most people out of the ambulance"", that it was as if the First Defendant was himself ""trying to get out"" of the ambulance, that Mr Martin ""gently pulled him towards me"" and that, when the First Defendant got back into the ambulance, Mr Martin let him go. Mr Martin at no stage agreed with the repeated suggestion put by Ms Edin that he tried to pull or haul the First Defendant out of the ambulance, although he agreed that there was a struggle after the First Defendant refused to get out of the ambulance. It was never put to Mr Martin that he had dragged the First Defendant.

115The Plaintiff submitted that there is nothing inherently incredible about the evidence of Mr Martin, nor was it manifestly self-contradictory. Rather, it was submitted that this was consistent with Mr Martin's other evidence in cross-examination that he did not want the First Defendant in the ambulance because he felt unsafe, and that he asked Ms Jacobs to request police attendance.

116Ms Adams submitted that it is important to bear in mind that the assault charge related to punching Mr Martin in the face which, on Mr Martin's evidence, unshaken during cross-examination and supported by Constable Hawes, took place outside the ambulance. Even if, contrary to the Plaintiff's submission, her Honour could have properly excluded Mr Martin's evidence about assisting the First Defendant to exit the ambulance from her prima facie case determination on the basis that it was inherently incredible, there remained evidence before her Honour capable of making out each element of assault, not only on the basis of Mr Martin's evidence, but also the evidence of Constable Hawes.

117Mr Smith submitted that the better interpretation of what her Honour did was that she dismissed the charge on the basis that the prosecution had not proved the assault beyond reasonable doubt, applying the principles in May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; 92 CLR 654 at 657-658.

118Mr Smith accepted that, if the Magistrate found no prima facie case, there would be error of law as there was a prima facie case of assault. However, he submitted that the Magistrate did not dismiss the charge on this basis. Although the Magistrate did not expressly follow the steps as set out by Garling J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Elskaf at [47], the nature of the charge and the evidence adduced in support of it was uncomplicated. It was submitted that the Magistrate's reasons for dismissing the charge were apparent from her exchange with the prosecutor, with those reasons relating to non-acceptance of the evidence of Mr Martin.

119Mr Smith submitted that, whilst accepting that her Honour failed to expressly address the determination of whether the evidence established a prima facie case, the evidence adduced in the prosecution case was such as to cause her Honour to entertain a reasonable doubt and dismiss the charge. 

Decision

120Once again, it is necessary to keep in mind that her Honour was presiding at a criminal trial. The principles to be applied with respect to the determination of a prima facie case, and if such a case was established, the decision whether the charge had been proved beyond reasonable doubt involved two separate and legally different steps. So much is well known and has been emphasised on more than one occasion in appeals to this Court from decisions of her Honour, including Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald, Director of Public Prosecutions v Lee and Director of Public Prosecutions v Elskaf.

121I am satisfied that error of law has been demonstrated in this case in accordance with this ground of appeal.

122Her Honour's rushed decision-making process meant that no assistance was sought from defence counsel appearing in the Local Court, nor did her Honour state what stage of the trial had been reached. As Sully J observed in Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald, these steps are no idle formality. They form an important part of the judicial process at a criminal trial without a jury, where the judicial officer (as the judge of the law), first determines whether a prima facie case exists and then (as judge of the facts), determines by reference to all the evidence, having heard counsel for the prosecutor and the defence, whether the guilt of the accused person has been established beyond reasonable doubt.

123If a prima facie case is established, the accused person has an opportunity to give evidence or to call witnesses, or to submit that the Court should not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused person. To rush from one stage to the next, without informing the accused person of the stage that has been reached in the trial, runs the risk of doing an injustice to the defence.

124The confused and confusing process which occurred at this hearing, in my view, bespeaks error of law on the part of the Magistrate. In circumstances where her Honour did not indicate that a prima facie case existed and that the Court was moving on to the second step in May v O'Sullivan, I will construe what occurred in the Local Court as involving a decision by her Honour to dismiss the charge upon the basis that there was no prima facie case.

125It is apparent that her Honour failed to apply the correct legal test as to prima facie case. Error of law has been demonstrated in accordance with this ground of appeal

Ground 5 - Failure to Provide Adequate Reasons for Dismissal

Submissions of the Parties

126Ms Adams submitted that, making all due allowance for the ex tempore nature of her Honour's remarks, there had been a failure to adequately explain the findings made and the reasons for arriving at those findings. There was no explanation of the legal principles being applied or the findings of fact to which those legal principles were to be applied.

127Mr Smith emphasised the ex tempore nature of the Magistrate's decision and the flexibility expressed in decisions of various courts when an appeal court examines ex tempore reasons for judgment.

128Whist acknowledging that the Magistrate did not separately state her reasons for dismissing the charge, Mr Smith submitted that her Honour's essential reasoning process can be identified from the exchange between her Honour and the prosecutor. Counsel sought to distinguish what had been said in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited at 408, concerning the unsatisfactory nature of reasons for judgment being found in an analysis of exchanges between the Bench and counsel during submissions. It was submitted that that case, which involved multiple charges, was to be distinguished from this case which involved a single and straightforward charge.

129Mr Smith submitted that the Magistrate's reasons may be found in the exchanges with the prosecutor indicating the following findings were made:

(a)Mr Martin denied that the First Defendant was aggressive or violent towards him;

(b)the First Defendant was in pain and demanded to be taken to a hospital;

(c)the First Defendant spat on the floor of the ambulance, but not at Mr Martin;

(d)Mr Martin called the First Defendant a ""filthy pig"" and demanded that he get out of the ambulance;

(e)in view of Mr Martin's evidence that the First Defendant refused to get out of the ambulance, her Honour's rejection of the evidence that he ""assisted"" the First Defendant out of the ambulance was reasonable, with her Honour finding instead that Mr Martin dragged the First Defendant out, thereby initiating the physical altercation.

130Mr Smith submitted that each of the five findings referred to in the preceding paragraph were articulated by her Honour during the exchange with the prosecutor and that, in view of the fact that the charge in this case was common assault, and given the relatively simple nature of the issues raised, her Honour's analysis of Mr Martin's evidence, and her concerns about it, disclosed the essential reasoning upon which her decision was made. 

131Finally, Mr Smith submitted that, in some instances, the simplicity of the context of the case or the state of the evidence may be such that a mere statement of a judicial officer's conclusion will sufficiently indicate the basis of the decision: Sun Alliance Insurance Limited v Massoud [1989] VR 8 at 19. 

Decision

132In approaching this ground of appeal, I have made full allowance for the demands on a busy Local Court, and the nature and limitations of an ex tempore decision delivered immediately after a hearing. However, the law requires a minimum standard in this respect and that standard was not achieved in this case.

133The difficulties referred to in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited, where reasons are sought to be found in an exchange between counsel and the Bench, are well illustrated in this case. The observations made in that judgment did not depend upon the number of charges or the complexity of the issues.

134The exchange between the Magistrate and the prosecutor in this case:

(a)failed to indicate whether the Magistrate was considering the question of a prima facie case, or the separate and later question of whether, as a question of fact, the charge had been proved;

(b)failed to make any (or any coherent) findings of fact at all;

(c)failed to set out any legal principles including the elements of the offence charged, or to apply those principles to the facts of this case.

135As the First Defendant does not contend that her Honour should be taken to have dismissed the charge by reference to self defence, I do not add this deficiency to the list. However, if self defence did play any part in the Magistrate's thinking, the position is worse given the absence of any reference to it in submissions or the Magistrate's reasons.

136To my mind, this is a clear and vivid example of error of law where a judicial officer has failed to give reasons as required by law. The reasons given are so defective that this Court is not in a position to divine the legal and factual basis upon which the Magistrate dismissed this charge. 

137With the greatest of respect, what happened in this case appears to exemplify the ""unconsidered or impulsive decision"" referred to by Meagher JA in Beale v Government Insurance Office (NSW), the avoidance of which forms part of the rationale for the obligation of a judicial officer to give reasons for a decision at the conclusion of a trial.

138I am satisfied that this ground of appeal has been made out.

The Appropriate Relief

Submissions of the Parties

139Ms Adams submitted that the Plaintiff was entitled to succeed on the statutory appeal and that it was not necessary to rely upon the alternative claim for prerogative relief, although if that point had been reached, it was submitted that such relief would have been appropriate.

140It was submitted for the Plaintiff that there was no discretion to decline to remit the matter to the Local Court if error of law was established: Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald. In any event, if there was a discretion, the Plaintiff submitted that there was no basis for this Court to decline to remit the matter to the Local Court.

141The Plaintiff sought an order setting aside the order of dismissal and an order remitting the matter to the Local Court to be dealt with by a different Magistrate. It was submitted that such an order had been made in a number of decisions of this Court, including decisions on appeal from her Honour, and that it was appropriate in the circumstances of this case.

142Mr Smith submitted that, in the event that error was established, the Court should exercise discretion pursuant to s.59(2) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and decline to remit the matter to the Local Court for hearing: Director of Public Prosecutions v Chresta [2005] NSWSC 233; 152 A Crim R 379. It was submitted that her Honour had the advantage of hearing and seeing the prosecution witnesses and had formed an adverse view with respect to the evidence of Mr Martin. The evidence of Constable Hawes did not touch upon the commencement of the physical altercation and thus, it was submitted, did not assist the prosecution.

143It was submitted, as well, that any likely penalty that may be imposed, if the offence was found proved, was not such as to warrant the remittal of the matter for rehearing.

144It was submitted for the First Defendant that the Court should decline to grant the relief sought in these circumstances.

Decision

145I am satisfied that the Plaintiff has established error of law in a number of respects on the part of the Magistrate in this case. The appropriate course in these circumstances is to remit the matter to the Local Court to enable that Court, as the trial court, to hear and determine the matter according to law. Such an approach is consistent with the proper relationship between the Supreme Court and the Local Court in statutory appeals with respect to criminal matters: Lake Macquarie City Council v Morris at 277 [65]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Belani [2005] NSWSC 1013; 64 NSWLR 319 at 333 [68].

146It is not necessary to resolve the question whether there is discretion to decline to remit the matter to the Local Court, as no basis has been demonstrated for the exercise of any available discretion.

147In any event, I do not accept the submission of the First Defendant that reliance can be placed upon the apparent views of the Magistrate in this case in determining not to remit the matter to the Local Court. In my view, the process demonstrated at this criminal trial is so tainted by denial of procedural fairness and error of law that whatever view was formed by the Magistrate should be placed entirely to one side.

148To the extent that it may be relevant, I observe that the assault charged in this case, if proved, is not a minor one. If the offence is found proved, an available aggravating factor on sentence would be that the victim, as a paramedic engaged in duties as an ambulance officer, was a health worker or other public official exercising public or community functions, and the offence arose because of the victim's occupation: s.21A(2)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

149In the circumstances of this case, I am entirely satisfied that the appropriate order to be made is that the matter should be remitted to the Local Court to be heard by a Magistrate other than Magistrate O'Shane. Such an order has been made in the past in a number of decisions on appeal from her Honour: Director of Public Prosecutions v Lee; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Neamati [2007] NSWSC 746; Director of Public Prosecutions v Yeo; Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions v Acevedo [2009] NSWSC 653 at [62]. 

150In light of what has happened in this case, I regret to say that there could be no confidence that a hearing on the merits, conducted according to law, would occur if the matter was remitted to Magistrate O'Shane.

A Recurring Pattern of Error and the Importance of Compliance with the Doctrine of Precedent

151Before concluding this judgment, I am bound to make a number of observations concerning this appeal.

152Judges exercising an appellate jurisdiction should choose their words carefully in giving judgment on appeal, keeping in mind that all judicial officers are human and can fall into error. This point was emphasised by the Hon Keith Mason AC (the former President of the Court of Appeal) in a paper entitled ""Throwing Stones: Cost/Benefit Analysis of Judges Being Offensive to Each Other"" (2008) 82 ALJ 260. However, the following observation was made at 262:

""I see nothing wrong with an appellate court noting that a significant error has occurred repeatedly in successive decisions by an identified judge who has ignored previous appellate reversals.""

153His Honour returned to this aspect at 264:

""Scenarios that call for a strong, but not necessarily offensive, response include repeated infractions of established principles of judicial method, disregard of binding authority, and mistakes involving well-known legal principles. Even here, caution is strongly advised. Errors may be the product of the way the case below was conducted. Slips and omissions in the language of reasons of busy judges do not always betoken substantive errors.""

154The fact that there have been a significant number of successful appeals from decisions of the Magistrate presiding in this case is not, of itself, such as to warrant specific comment. Where, however, the errors found in cases are repeated over and over again, it is appropriate to note the pattern. 

155In Director of Public Prosecutions v Elskaf, Garling J said at [69]-[72]:

""[69] The first is that it is difficult to understand how the Magistrate has fallen into errors of the kind which I have found, since this judgment is not the first occasion upon which the proper procedure has been described, and the correct procedure pointed out to the Magistrate by this court.

[70] Her Honour has had the correct process drawn to her attention in a number of decisions of this court, on appeal from her determinations in summary proceedings. These include:

(a) DPP v Wunderwald [2004] NSWSC 182 (Sully J);
(b) DPP v Lee [2006] NSWSC 270 (Howie J);
(c) DPP (Cth) v Neamati [2007] NSWSC 746 (Howie J);
(d) Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions v Acevedo [2009] NSWSC 653 (Davies J).

[71] If I may say, with respect, the judgment of Sully J in Wunderwald sets out in a model of clarity, the Magistrate's obligations when considering whether a prima facie case had been established. His Honour's judgment was not followed in this case, but rather seems to have been entirely ignored.

[72] In light of this history of decisions by this court, and the failures identified in this case, I can have no confidence that Magistrate O'Shane would, if the matter was returned to her to complete, undertake the further hearing of it in accordance with the law.""

156To the decisions referred to by Garling J should be added the judgment in Director of Public Prosecutions v Yeo. 

157It is a fundamental principle of the law that, where the Supreme Court decides a point of law on an appeal from a Magistrate, that decision is binding on all inferior courts in the State, with judges of a court inferior in the hierarchy not being at liberty to regard themselves as not bound by the decision of the higher court. After stating this principle in Fleming v White [1981] 2 NSWLR 719 at 725-726, Street CJ (Hope JA and Nagle CJ at CL agreeing) said at 726B-C:

""To countenance any departure from this disciplined order would involve not only the erosion of the integrated nature of a hierarchical court structure but also the introduction of a wholly inadmissible element of uncertainty in the administration of the law. Submission to higher authority is the proper portion of all judges and judicial officers from the magistrate up to a judge of an ultimate appellate court when sitting alone.""

158I have mentioned earlier in this judgment the rationale for the doctrine of precedent and the need for compliance with it in support of the rule of law and the administration of justice.

159The recurring errors into which the Magistrate has fallen demonstrate repeated breaches of the requirement of a judicial officer to preside at a criminal trial conducted according to law, with a fair opportunity to the parties to present their cases. 

160Although the errors of the Magistrate identified in the various decisions to which I have referred have arisen in different factual contexts, there is a pattern of fundamental error in the discharge of judicial duties. 

161The doctrine of precedent operates to remind judicial officers of the legally correct processes to be followed, with an expectation that a judicial officer whose decision has been overturned, will not repeat the error which has given rise to appellate intervention. Regrettably, that doctrine does not appear to have achieved its purpose in the case of decisions of the Magistrate to which reference has been made. 

Costs

162The Plaintiff seeks an order for costs against the First Defendant, but submits as well that it would be appropriate to grant him a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951, with the Plaintiff not seeking to enforce any costs order beyond the level of any amount covered by such a certificate. 

163In the event that this point was reached in the proceedings, Mr Smith sought the grant of a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951.

164As I have mentioned, the Second Defendant has filed an appearance submitting to all orders save as to costs. No costs order is sought against the Second Defendant.

Orders

165I am well satisfied that the Plaintiff has demonstrated an entitlement to relief by way of the statutory appeal under ss.56 and 59 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. It is not necessary to address the alternative claim for prerogative relief in these circumstances, although had there been an impediment to the grant of statutory appellate relief, I would have granted the Plaintiff prerogative relief in this case.

166I make the following orders:

(a)the appeal is allowed;

(b)I set aside the order of Magistrate O'Shane made at the Downing Central Local Court on 20 January 2012 dismissing the charge against the First Defendant of assault under s.61 Crimes Act 1900;

(c)the matter is remitted to the Local Court to be heard before a different Magistrate conformably with this judgment;

(d)the First Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff's costs;

(e)the First Defendant is granted a certificate under s.6 Suitors' Fund Act 1951.

2759581,Kahl v R [2012] NSWCCA 136,"Judgment


	
	McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm an offence against s 35(2) of the Crimes Act. He seeks orders that the conviction be quashed and further that a verdict of acquittal be entered.
	
	
	In the course of the summing up the trial judge discussed with the jury the element of recklessness in the offence. His Honour directed the jury that the Crown must prove that the accused realised that his punch might cause ""some form of bodily injury."" Two days after the verdict this Court delivered judgment in Blackwell v R (2011) NSWCCA 93 in which it unanimously held that to prove the element of recklessness in s 35(2) the Crown must prove that the accused realised that his actions might cause ""grievous bodily harm"" or ""really serious injury.""
	
	
	The respondent acknowledges that having regard to the decision in Blackwell the direction given by the trial judge was erroneous. Accordingly, the issues which must be considered by this Court are whether the proviso should be applied, as the Crown contends, or the court should enter a verdict of acquittal as the appellant contends.
	
	
	The trial was held with a jury. The Crown called 21 witnesses and tendered a recording of a police interview with the appellant. The appellant did not call any evidence.
	
	
	The charge arose out of an incident in the early hours of New Year's Day 2010 in Dorrigo. The complainant was in company with his friend Jay West and his girl friend Emily Henness. He parked his car in Cudgery Street around 2 am. Subsequently, Mr West drove the complainant's car to get cigarettes and in the course of doing so did some burn outs in and around Cudgery Street. On his return Dylan Hutchinson complained about Mr West's driving and punched him. Subsequently the complainant drove away from the area with Ms Henness and Mr West as passengers. As they left a bottle was thrown at the complainant's car. The complainant then stopped and quickly turned the car around skidding the wheels in the process. He got out of the car and yelled ""who threw the bottle."" The complainant was then approached by a number of persons including Dylan Hutchinson and the appellant. Soon after, the appellant struck the complainant with a single punch to his face. The blow caused the complainant to fall backwards and hit his head on the roadway. There was no dispute at the trial that he suffered grievous bodily harm as a result of that fall.
	
	
	At his trial the appellant framed his defence around self-defence. In the alternative he said that the punch was an instinctive blow delivered without any intent. In his police interview he said that he went to break the complainant and Mr Hutchinson apart but the complainant pushed him and he punched him. He said ""Yea we went around the back and that's where I hit old mate after he pushed, wasn't to hurt him, you know. It was just a bit of, a bit of a shock and self defence sort of thing."" When he was asked to describe his actual swing he said ""it wasn't like, you know, line him up and want to kill him or tear his head off. It was like a quick snap sort of thing ... just a matter of reflex and then holy shit, you know, he split his head open.""
	
	
	The defence counsel submitted to the jury that the punch was delivered without contemplation that it might cause the complainant bodily injury. lt was further submitted that the punch was not very hard as there was no evidence of any abrasion or injury to the complainant's face or the appellant's hands or knuckles.
	
	
	In my opinion the appeal must be upheld and the conviction quashed. Whether or not in inflicting the blow upon the complainant the appellant acted recklessly realising that he might cause ""grievous bodily harm"" or ""really serious injury"" was not considered by the jury. I am not persuaded that the evidence at the trial justified a conclusion that the appellant was nevertheless guilty of the offence as charged. Whether the Crown will be able to discharge its burden in relation to the defence depends upon the view which a jury may take of the evidence of various witnesses and the inferences which can be drawn from the circumstances in which the offence occurred.
	
	
	With respect to the appellant's submission that a verdict of acquittal should be entered I am also of the view that this court cannot accept that submission. As I understand the evidence presented to the appellant's trial it would be open to a jury to conclude that in delivering a punch to the complainant's jaw with sufficient force to knock him over the appellant may have realised that his actions might cause the relevant degree of harm. As with the application of the proviso the appropriate conclusion to this question will depend upon the view which the jury takes of the evidence of various witnesses.
	
	
	Accordingly in my judgment the following orders should be made:
	


1. Appeal upheld.

2. The conviction for the offence contrary to s 35(2) Crimes Act is quashed.

3. Order that there be a new trial.


	
	GARLING J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

		29 November 2016",2012-07-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759586,Banovec v R [2012] NSWCCA 137,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  In October-November 2009 Mr Oliver Banovec (the applicant) stood trial on five counts of fraudulent omission to account, contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of perjury, contrary to s 327(1) of the Crimes Act.  A jury returned verdicts of guilty on each count.  On 19 February 2010 he entered pleas to two further counts, being a further count of perjury and a count involving the destruction or damage of a book, contrary to s 67(1) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth).  He was sentenced on all matters on 23 April 2010 by the District Court (Ainslie-Wallace DCJ).
2An application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence was filed some 19 months later, on 1 December 2011.  With respect to the appeal against the convictions, the applicant required leave because the grounds did not involve ""a question of law alone"": Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1)(a).  As to the convictions, I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben JA and with his reasons.  In respect of the appeal against the sentences, I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal for the reasons set out below.
Proposed appeal against sentences3The only ground in the application for leave to appeal relating to the sentences asserted that the sentencing judge ""did not have before her the facts relating to the disadvantage that non Australian citizens have in relation to harsher prison conditions"".  In what can best be described as a skeletal written submission in support of this ground, counsel cryptically referred to ""the unknown harsher prison conditions at the time of sentence"".  In an affidavit sworn on 4 February 2012 and filed in this Court on 21 February 2012, the applicant referred to information he had obtained, both from officers in the Department of Corrective Services and by way of advice from Mr Will Hutchins, Senior Solicitor, Prisoners Legal Service at Legal Aid NSW, the latter contained in a letter dated 23 June 2011.  Mr Hutchins referred to the fact that the applicant was a permanent resident and was married to an Australian citizen, but was himself a citizen of Austria.  He noted that the responsible Minister under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) had power to cancel a visa if the applicant were unable to satisfy the Minister that he passed the character test: s 501(2).  
4A person does not pass the character test if he or she has ""a substantial criminal record"": s 501(6).  Mr Hutchins noted that the cancellation power existed if the person were sentenced ""to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more"": s 501(7)(c).  That was true and applied in the case of the applicant, whose sentences included a sentence of two years six months.  Although not referred to in the letter, an alternative basis for finding a substantial criminal record was that the applicant had been sentenced to two or more terms of imprisonment where the total of those terms is two years or more: s 501(7)(d).  The applicant's sentences totalled seven years.  
5The letter referred to the likely attitude of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (referred to as ""DIAC"") and of the Department of Corrective Services.  Relevantly the letter stated:
""You are of 'interest to DIAC' because you are liable to visa cancellation due to your gaol sentences.  It is my understanding that DIAC do not consider cases until the inmate is within 18 months of their parole eligibility date.  In your case, this will be from 11/3/2013.  
Although Corrective Services says that in these circumstances, progression to C3 will be considered on its merits, this will only happen if DIAC has made a decision that the person will not be deported.""
6The applicant's complaint is that, despite enjoying a C1 minimum security classification, he will not be housed in a minimum security facility and able to perform work off the grounds of the correctional centre, until DIAC has determined not to deport him.  Although he was advised that such a decision would be made ""within 12 months of my earliest possible release date"", he inferred that he would spend 80% of his time in custody in a maximum security facility, without the opportunity to participate in the works release program.
7Although that information is supplied in an inadmissible form, I did not understand the Director to object to its tender on that basis.  Rather, the objection was based on the fact that such information was readily available at the time of sentencing and, if it had not been presented to the sentencing judge at that time, no error was established and accordingly there was no occasion for this Court to re-sentence the applicant, to which exercise the further evidence might be relevant.
8The source of the material speaks to its accuracy.  Further, it is consistent with departmental practice of both the immigration and custodial authorities, as explained to this Court in other cases.  The Director did not suggest that it was inaccurate.
9That conclusion is double-edged for the applicant.  On the one hand, it permits the Court to accept the evidence, despite the form in which it was presented; on the other hand, it demonstrates that such information was readily available from the date of conviction, when it became apparent that the applicant was facing a term of imprisonment which would, almost inevitably, attract the consideration of the immigration authorities.
Hardship in imprisonment10Implicit in the applicant's submissions is the proposition that an offender who is likely to serve his or her sentence in conditions which are significantly harsher than those applicable to the general prison population is entitled to some reduction in sentence on that account.  Such conditions of imprisonment are not to be treated as a ""mitigating factor"" and do not appear in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"").  However, the need to take account of the effect of particular hardship has long been recognised.  In R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243, a case concerned with the consequences of providing assistance to the prosecution, Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ stated at 255:
""[The judge] will have to take into account any threat to the prisoner's safety and both the conditions under which he will have to serve his sentence in order to avoid reprisals and the steps which will need to be taken to protect him once he is released.  Evidence should normally be led as to the existence and extent of such a threat, but to a large degree the judge is entitled to rely upon his own awareness of the severe hardships of protective custody in gaol.  If there is any particular facility provided for the prisoner beyond the normal protection system, the judge should be given that information.  It should not normally be a matter about which formal evidence is needed or about which there should be any real dispute.  If there is any specific loss to the prisoner as a consequence of the conditions of his incarceration, it obviously should be raised expressly.  In the present case, for example, it is asserted that the applicant has been denied the benefit of camp remissions.  Just for what period before his release a prisoner with a thirteen year minimum term would have enjoyed the advantages of being sent to a camp is anything but clear, but such a loss of remissions (if applicable) is the sort of matter which should be raised expressly.""
11This passage in Cartwright has been referred to as authority for the proposition that ""every year in protective custody is equivalent to a significantly longer loss of liberty under the ordinary conditions of prison"": Kirby J in AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46; 198 CLR 111 at [105].  Other factors which may give rise to hardship in custody, including disabilities (physical or mental and as a consequence of disease, genetic factors or age) and lack of facility in English, have been taken into account.  As noted by Street CJ, delivering the judgment of this Court (which included Nagle CJ at CL and Lee J), in R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 at 353:
""It is obvious that imprisonment will always impose physical and emotional hardships and deprivation upon the person imprisoned.  But there can be cases where that hardship and deprivation would be particularly aggravated by matters subjective to the prisoner and this is a proper consideration to be taken into account by a sentencing judge.  For example in a case to which we have been referred, R v Todd [1976] Qd R 21, the effect of imprisonment upon a blind man was held to be relevant and material in determining the length of his sentence.""
12In Bekink v R [1999] WASCA 160; 107 A Crim R 415, Ipp J considered the effect of a ""lock down"" on prisoners at Casuarina Prison in Western Australia, following a Christmas Day riot.  He noted the offender had been confined to cell ""under conditions not significantly different from those applicable to prisoners who have committed offences in prison, and for a far longer period, even though - while in prison - he has done nothing wrong"": at [6].  
13The need for a variety of circumstances of hardship to be taken into account in sentencing has been recognised in all jurisdictions in Australia; a selection of the available authorities was collected by Steytler P in Houghton v Western Australia [2006] WASCA 143; 32 WAR 260; 163 A Crim R 226 at [23]-[38].  Houghton was itself a case in which the claim of exceptional hardship was made by a foreign national facing the possibility of visa revocation and deportation and who was hence unlikely to obtain low security classifications towards the end of his sentence.  After reviewing the relevant departmental policies, Steytler P concluded at [45]:
""It seems, from all of this, to be probable that the prospect of the appellant's deportation, not known by the sentencing Judge, has resulted in the loss, or at least a diminution in, the prospect that the appellant would otherwise have achieved a minimum security rating and be accorded home leave privileges.  It seems also to be probable (unless it can be determined that the Minister will not exercise his discretion to cancel the appellant's visa) that the prospect of deportation will result in the appellant's ineligibility for a re-entry release order that might, otherwise, have been made.  However, even if it be assumed (without deciding) that these consequences give rise to a hardship of the kind that should be taken into account in considering whether the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the appellant is appropriate (and it needs to be borne in mind, in this respect, that home leave and re-entry release orders are privileges, and not rights, that are granted or refused in accordance with the rules and policies of the Department of Corrective Services), I would not alter the sentence imposed upon the appellant.""
14Murray AJA agreed with Steytler P.  Roberts-Smith JA also agreed subject to the qualification that he was not prepared to assume that the potential consequences of possible deportation gave rise to ""a hardship of the kind which should be taken into account in considering whether the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon [the appellant] is appropriate"": at [50].
15Different approaches to the question of hardship may well reflect the circumstances revealed in particular cases and an assessment of the particular effects of department policies and practices in different jurisdictions.  However, the underlying principle that some allowance should be made in sentencing for specific hardship not faced by the general prison population is beyond dispute.
Changes in circumstances16A particular issue will arise where the circumstances of additional hardship arose after sentencing and were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of sentencing.  Such circumstances may include the incurring of a disability or diagnosis of an illness during the course of the sentence, or, as in Bekink, a change in the circumstances of imprisonment as a result of an unpredictable event.
17There are two broad approaches which have been adopted in such circumstances.  The first, and more generally accepted, is to leave any amelioration of the sentence to the discretion of the Executive.  However, since the abolition of remissions, the mechanisms by which the Executive can take such steps are greatly restricted.  Secondly, there may be a difference in approach depending upon whether the new information has become available whilst an appeal was pending, as opposed to it arising after the appropriate appeal period has expired.
18It is not necessary to resolve these differing approaches in the present case, because the likelihood that the applicant would face a longer period in a higher security institution because of his visa status was readily foreseeable following his convictions.  The evidence he now seeks to rely upon was not ""fresh"" in the sense that the relevant statutory scheme in the Migration Act and the polices and practices of the Department of Corrective Services and the immigration authorities were not known at the time of sentencing.  The question in this case is thus whether the applicant should be entitled to reopen his sentences in order to invite this Court to take into account a factor not relied upon before the sentencing judge, although it could, and arguably should, have been raised at that stage.  
Reopening sentencing exercise - nature of appeal19The nature of an appeal to this Court has been the subject of consideration in a number of cases over the years, despite which a degree of uncertainty persists.  The Court has been described as a ""court of error"": see, for example, Simpson J in JM v R [2008] NSWCCA 254 (McClellan CJ at CL and Nettle AJA agreeing) at [25], and the authorities referred to there.  However, it is not entirely clear what consequences flow from this label.  It may be accepted that the Court, on a sentencing appeal, does not engage in a de novo exercise of original jurisdiction.  On the other hand, an appeal court which conducts an appeal ""by way of rehearing"" makes orders on the basis of the law as it stands at the time of the appeal and on the facts established at that time: see Einfeld v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 at [50].  A court which has the power to receive further or fresh evidence is generally treated as conducting an appeal by way of rehearing.  That this Court will receive ""fresh"" evidence, in the conventional sense of evidence that was not available at trial and could not with reasonable diligence have been obtained at that time, was affirmed in R v Lanham [1970] 2 NSWR 217 at 218 (Mason and Manning JJA and Isaacs J).  
20However, at least at the level of general principle, the Court has stated that it will not receive evidence of events post-dating the sentence under appeal: R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177 at 178 (Street CJ, Moffitt P and Lee J agreeing), though the particular order of the Court was a refusal of an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal.  As Simpson J noted in JM v R, at [26], the distinction between events or circumstances that happened or arose after the sentencing and those which pre-dated or existed at the time of the sentencing, is not always a bright line.  The example of a medical condition which later deteriorates was given.  Similarly, there are other events which may be foreseeable at the time of sentencing, but do not materialise until after the sentence is imposed.  The present case may be seen to fit within this last category.
21The statutory conferral of jurisdiction on this Court, in respect of an appeal against sentence, is to be found in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act which provides:
""6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases
...
(3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.""
22Whilst the exercise of that jurisdiction is subject to the constraints identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505, the requirement that ""some error has been made in exercising the discretion"" does not identify the basis upon which error may be perceived.  Section 6(3) does not permit the imposition of inflexible rules in that respect.  The preferable course is to identify broad principles governing the exercise of the discretion, while allowing for the possibility of exceptional cases where it is appropriate for the court to intervene.  One factor to be taken into account is the statutory context, as it exists from time to time, which may permit intervention to correct sentencing error otherwise than by appeal: see, for example, Sentencing Procedure Act, s 43; Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), Pt 7 Review of convictions and sentences.
23A different approach is traditionally taken with respect to evidence of post-conviction events where the evidence is tendered, not for the purpose of demonstrating a basis for intervention by this Court, but for the consideration of the Court in the event that it intervenes on other grounds and embarks upon a re-sentencing of the offender.  It should also be noted that this Court should not necessarily take an inflexible view in respect of material which was before the sentencing judge, but in circumstances where its significance was not fully appreciated and it was not relied upon by the offender: AB v The Queen, where different analyses were applied by the majority (Gummow and Callinan JJ at [55] and Kirby J at [92]-[96]) and the minority (McHugh J at [20]-[21] and Hayne J at [127]-[130]).
24In the present case, the matter now sought to be relied upon was not raised before the trial judge.  No explanation was provided as to why it was not raised.  As indicated above, the circumstances upon which reliance could have been placed were readily available for consideration by the applicant (who was legally represented by counsel).  The point was not one of speculation as to future possibilities; it merely involved an assessment of the likelihood of a particular event, based on known policies and practices and extant statutory provisions.
25While there should be a grant of leave to permit the applicant to raise these issues, the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that the evidence now sought to be relied upon is not fresh evidence.  On the basis that the Court may have some broader power to admit such evidence, the circumstances of the present case did not demonstrate that this was a case in which intervention was warranted to correct an omission on the part of the sentencing judge to consider a matter which may well have been relevant to the exercise of her discretion, but which was not raised before her.
26HOEBEN JA:Offences and sentenceOn 23 November 2009 after a trial lasting 19 days, the appellant was found guilty of five counts of fraudulently omitting to account for money contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900 (the fraud counts) and one count of perjury, by making a false statement in an affidavit, contrary to s 327(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the false affidavit count).
27On 19 February 2010 the appellant entered pleas of guilty to two additional charges.  These were one count of perjury in testimony in Supreme Court proceedings No 1488 of 2007 (""the false testimony count""), contrary to s 327(1) Crimes Act 1900 and one count of destroying documents contrary to s 67(1) of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the document destruction count).
28On 23 April 2010 the appellant was sentenced by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ in respect of those offences.  The effective sentence imposed by her Honour was imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months.
29The appellant appeals against his conviction for the fraud counts and the false affidavit count and against sentence.  The grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant are:
1. The Crown failed to lead relevant and material evidence.
2. The appellant applies to lead new evidence.
3. The conviction on the failure to account charges (s 178 Crimes Act 1900) was infected by the evidence of the perjury charge.  The trial judge unfairly refused to grant an application for separate trials.
4. The trial judge failed to properly direct the jury in regard to the distinction between the receipt of funds for personal use and the receipt of funds by the corporation in the course of business when she could and should have done so.
5. The trial judge did not have before her the facts relating to the disadvantage that non-Australian citizens have in relation to harsher prison conditions.
Factual background
30In relation to each of the fraud charges, the Crown's case was that:
(a) On five separate occasions between about 15 November 2004 and 20 May 2005 the appellant, who controlled a mortgage broking business named Capital Trust and also controlled two companies named Capital Securitisation Ltd (CSL) and ACN110802938 Pty Ltd (ACN), had a conversation with the main Crown witness, Avinash , about a series of investment loan opportunities Mr Mookhy might invest in by lending money to borrowers respectively named Abadier, Farnhill, Holt, Maertin and Angus in which he offered the loans as investments to Mr Mookhy.
(b) The appellant sent Mr Mookhy a fax in relation to each of the Abadier, Farnhill, Holton, Maertin and Angus loans recording the terms of the proposed loan in writing.  Those terms included reference to precise borrowers, the fact the loans would be secured by a mortgage and a caveat over precisely identified real property, identified by address and in most cases deposited plan number.
(c) Mr Mookhy advanced the funds comprising the Abadier, Farnhill, Holton, Maertin and Angus loans to Capital Trust or CSL on the terms discussed and set out in the conversations and faxes and did not consent to the money being on-lent to borrowers other than those identified in the faxes or to the money being used for any other purpose.
(d) None of the purported borrowers referred to in the faxes for the Abadier, Farnhill, Holton, Maertin and Angus loans ever applied to borrow money from the appellant or companies he controlled on the terms detailed in the phone conversations or in the faxes.
(e) The appellant received the money Mr Mookhy advanced to Capital Trust and CSL in his personal capacity, not on behalf of the companies, and used the money raised from the Abadier, Farnhill, Holton, Maertin and Angus loans for the general running costs of his business, Capital Trust and CSL by dispersing the funds advanced by Mr Mookhy through the bank accounts which he controlled of Capital Trust, CSL and ACN.
(f) The appellant knew that he was not entitled to use the money received for the general running costs of his business and thereby fraudulently failed to account for the monies advanced by Mr Mookhy on each of the purported Abadier, Farnhill, Holton, Maertin and Angus loans.
31The appellant's case was that Mr Mookhy was provided with documentation between him and CSL which clearly set out that Mr Mookhy would place the funds with CSL and that CSL would pay interest on the investment.  The appellant contended that the documentation (referred to as the ""Information Memorandum"" (IM) gave to the appellant a wide discretion to invest the funds under the agreement.  The appellant contended that he invested the funds with One Spencer Street Pty Limited in accordance with the agreement.  The appellant accepted that the One Spencer Street investment failed.  The appellant contended that CSL commenced action and obtained judgment against One Spencer Street and had at all material times acted in accordance with the agreement between it and Mr Mookhy.
32The appellant contended that he had procured the creation of the IM so as to make clear to potential investors the terms under which they could invest money with CSL.  One of those terms was that the money could be invested at his sole discretion on behalf of CSL.
33The appellant contended that the IM, together with the unsecured notes (UN), governed the agreement between the parties and that his discretion to reinvest into alternative investments (other than those referred to in the faxes) was agreed and that the funds of Mr Mookhy were loaned to One Spencer Street in accordance with the agreement.
34At trial the appellant gave evidence that he gave a copy of the IM to Mr Mookhy on 15 November 2004 and faxed and mailed other copies of the IM to Mr Mookhy on 16 November 2004.  It was Mr Mookhy's evidence that he did not receive a copy of the IM on 15 November 2004 from the appellant and that the first time he saw a letter from the appellant to him dated 16 November 2004 purporting to enclose the IM, was when it was shown to him in his solicitor's office in November 2006.  Mr Mookhy said that he never received a copy of the IM from the appellant by fax.
35The Crown case in relation to the perjury charge was:  On or about 14 November 2006 the appellant swore an affidavit stating that on 16 November 2004 he sent to Mr Mookhy, via an email to fax service, a fax comprising a copy of a covering letter and the IM.  The IM comprised 37 pages and the letter was two pages, giving a total of 39 pages.  The affidavit was sworn by the appellant in civil proceedings in which Mr Mookhy was seeking to recover the loan monies from CSL and the appellant.
36When giving evidence at trial, the appellant repeated this claim that the IM he sent by fax to Mr Mookhy on 16 November 2004 with a two page covering letter, was the finalised IM of 37 pages in length (including an application form) which was exhibit 1 in the trial.
37The appellant annexed to his affidavit a record of the purported fax in the form of a fax transmission report, which purported to be an email from the ""Dingofax"" service sent on 16 November 2004.
38The appellant did not and could not have sent the fax comprising the finalised IM and covering letter to Mr Mookhy on 16 November 2004 in the manner claimed in the affidavit and the fax transmission report annexed to the appellant's affidavit was false because -
(i)  The subscriber had never been able to access the Dingofax ""outbound"" email to fax machine service and was not able to do so on 16 November 2004.
(ii) Unifier 2 Pty Limited, which kept records of all Dingofax delivery notifications, had no record of the notification number referred to by the appellant or anything close to it.
(iii) Unifier 2 Pty Limited, which kept records of all Dingofax outbound email to fax transmissions, had no records of an outbound fax on 16 November 2004, 39 pages long or of an outbound fax on that date of a duration of 4 minutes and 56 seconds, or of an outbound fax being sent to the specified destination, or an outbound fax on that date being delivered at 9:07:05AM AEST, these being the details recorded on the purported fax transmission report presented by the appellant.
(iv) There was no record in Telstra's records of any communication being received by Mr Mookhy's telephone that matched the time of the purported fax communication referred to in Annexure A to the affidavit of the appellant.
(v) There was no record in Unifier 2's records of the fax referred to in Annexure A to the affidavit of the appellant, sworn 14 November 2006.
(vi) It was not possible for a client of Ozefax (as the appellant was) to use Dingofax to send an outbound email to fax machine communication before May 2005.
(vii) It was not possible for a delivery notification of the type annexed to the affidavit of the appellant and marked ""A"" to have been sent on 16 November 2004.
(viii) The user email address was not registered to send outbound faxes with Dingofax in November 2004.
(ix) An outbound fax transmission of 39 pages on the Dingofax service could not have been completed in 4 minutes 56 seconds and would have taken much longer.
(x) The finalised IM which the appellant claimed he had given to Mr Mookhy on 15 November 2004 and faxed to Mr Mookhy on 16 November 2004 was not in existence on 16 November 2004 because it was still being drafted by the solicitor of the appellant and Capital Trust - Simon Singer - as at 29 November 2004 and was not finalised until after that date.
39The appellant at trial had no answer to the Crown's case in relation to the perjury charge.
40It was not disputed at trial that Mr Mookhy provided funds on five separate occasions to Capital Trust and CSL.  It was not disputed that CSL sent faxes inviting Mr Mookhy to invest money in CSL.  It was not disputed that in the faxes an investment opportunity was identified and that the faxes further identified that the investment would be secured by a specific property if each investment had settled.  It was not disputed that Mr Mookhy received all the yearly and monthly investment statements.  What were disputed were the terms of the investment.
41It was common ground that the appellant did not invest the money provided by Mr Mookhy in the investments identified in the faxes, but instead invested the money in other investments which subsequently failed, resulting in the money being lost.
42The Crown sought to refute the appellant's evidence that he had a discretion under the IM and UN to invest funds as he saw fit.  The Crown led evidence that the IM did not exist in its final form as of 15 and 16 November 2004 when the appellant said that he provided copies to Mr Mookhy.  To this end the Crown adduced evidence from Mr Singer to the effect that substantial amendments were still being made to the IM on 22, 26 and 29 November 2004.
43In order to understand the first two grounds of appeal, it is necessary to say something about the ""new evidence"" which the appellant sought to adduce and its relevance to the first ground of appeal.  The ""new evidence"" comprised parts of a statement of Cedric Adrian Millner, dated 22 April 2008 (MFI 3).  It was submitted that because Mr Millner was not called by the Crown to give evidence in accordance with this statement, the trial was unfair and that the appellant lost a realistic chance of an acquittal.
44The relevant parts of the statement are:
""31 A few days before I invested, I picked up a document from the Capital Trust office.  I got it from reception.  I rang up and got it and left.  
32 I am shown a document headed ""Information Memorandum"" dated November 2004.  It is marked ASIC barcode SBO 007447.
33 I have examined this document and can say:
(a) This appears to be the same as the Information Memorandum (IM) I picked up from the Capital Trust Office;
(b) I read the IM; ...
42 Rather than have the tenant pay the bond to Grand Hotel Wyong Pty Ltd I asked the tenant to pay the bond straight to Capital Trust.  The tenant paid the bond to Capital Trust on or around 1 December 2004.
48 I am shown a document headed ""Note Certificate - CSL Unsecured Notes Issue No 4"" and dated 6 December 2004.  It is marked with ASIC barcode SOP 1591654.
49 I have examined this document and can say:
(a) I received this document in or around December 2004.
(b) This document records that:
 (i) The Note Certificate No is 410; and
 (ii) The investment was $300,000.""
45In the appeal there was no issue that the appellant had become aware of the existence of the statement from Mr Millner at some time between April and July 2008 and had made a photocopy of it (affidavit of Phillip Peck, par 15-16).  There was no issue that the Crown brief which included the statement of Mr Millner was provided to the legal advisors of the appellant on 20 January 2009.  There was no issue that in correspondence the appellant acknowledged the receipt of Mr Millner's statement (affidavit of John Davidson, par 12, Annexures E1 and E2, par 15, Annexure F).  There was no issue that the statement of Mr Millner was served on the legal advisors of the appellant on 12 August 2009 when the full Crown brief was re-served.  It was common ground that the witness list sent to counsel for the appellant on 12 October 2009 did not include Mr Millner.  It was common ground that at no time prior to, or during the trial, was any request made by or on behalf of the appellant for Mr Millner to be called as a Crown witness or to be made available by the Crown for cross-examination.
Ground of Appeal 1:  The Crown failed to lead relevant and material evidence.Ground of Appeal 2:  The appellant applies to lead new evidence.
(Both these grounds of appeal relate to the fraud counts.)
46The appellant submitted that the Crown had an overall obligation to ensure that criminal trials are conducted fairly.  The appellant submitted that there was an obligation to call witnesses whose evidence was necessary to give a complete account of the events on which the prosecution was based and to allow the narrative to unfold (Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657 at 674 (Dawson J)).  The appellant relied upon the sixth statement of principle identified in The Queen v Apostilides [1984] HCA 38; 154 CLR 563 at 575:
""6 A decision of the prosecutor not to call a particular person as a witness will only constitute a ground for setting aside a conviction if, when viewed against the conduct of the trial as a whole, it is seen to give rise to a miscarriage of justice. ...""
The Court explained the sixth principle at 577-578:
""It remains to offer a comment on the sixth proposition.  In Richardson the Court said:
""Once it is acknowledged that the prosecutor has a discretion and that there is no rule of law requiring him to call a particular witness, it becomes apparent that the decision of the prosecutor not to call a particular witness can only constitute a ground for setting aside a conviction and granting a new trial if it constitutes misconduct which, when viewed against the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, gives rise to a miscarriage of justice.""
In our formulation of the sixth proposition we have omitted the reference to misconduct, intending thereby to broaden the approach so as to focus directly on the consequences, objectively perceived, that the failure to call the witness has had on the course of the trial and its outcome. It is not necessary to postulate misconduct of the prosecutor as an essential condition precedent to a miscarriage of justice. No doubt in the great majority of cases of this kind an appellate tribunal which finds a miscarriage of justice to have occurred will trace that miscarriage to a wrong exercise of judgment by the prosecutor which led to the witness not being called. In cases where there has been no error of judgment there will be less likelihood of a miscarriage resulting from the failure to call the witness. Nevertheless, the absence of testimony from a witness may lead to a miscarriage of justice without any error having occurred.  ... So, if a prosecutor fails to call a witness whose evidence is essential to the unfolding of the case for the Crown the central question is not whether his decision constitutes misconduct but whether in all the circumstances the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory.""
47The appellant submitted, by reference to that statement of principle, that the evidence of Mr Millner was relevant to an important issue in the case and its absence would have created a false impression in the minds of the jury as to what was happening.  The appellant submitted that the effect of the evidence of Mr Millner was that the IM was well and truly in the marketplace in November 2004 and was being used by the appellant as a basis for other persons such as Mr Millner making loans to his companies.  The appellant submitted that the evidence of Mr Millner refuted the Crown's argument that it was the faxes which provided the basis for the investment of monies by Mr Mookhy.  The appellant submitted that the evidence of Mr Millner supported his evidence that he provided copies of the IM to Mr Mookhy on 15-16 November 2004.
48The appellant submitted that if the Crown had led this evidence from Mr Millner, the jury may well have been left with a reasonable doubt as to whether Mr Mookhy had advanced monies in accordance with the faxes, rather than in accordance with the terms of investment set out in the IM and UN.  The evidence of Mr Millner, the appellant submitted, also supported the defence that he had an honest belief that by investing the money in the way in which he did, he was acting in accordance with the agreement which he had with Mr Mookhy as set out in the IM.
49The appellant submitted that the failure to call Mr Millner exposed the Crown to the criticism that it was engaged in a strategic manoeuvre to ""pick and choose"" witnesses to present the most adverse case from the appellant's point of view.  The appellant submitted that the calling of Mr Millner's evidence would have prevented the Crown making submissions to the effect that the IM was not available in November 2004 and therefore could not have been given to Mr Mookhy as the appellant asserted.
50The appellant submitted that if the evidence of Mr Millner had been led by the Crown, it would have been open to the jury to draw an inference or accept an hypothesis consistent with the appellant's version of events and therefore consistent with innocence.  In substance therefore the appellant submitted that the failure by the Crown to call Mr Millner caused the trial to miscarry.
51Before examining the submissions of the appellant more closely, it is necessary to determine by reference to his statement, what the evidence of Mr Millner would have been.  The first point is that the evidence was general rather than specific.  The pick up of the document occurred ""a few days before I invested"".  He was shown the 04 version of the IM and said that ""this appears to be the same"" as the IM which he picked up.  In relation to the investment of the monies, he said that the payment took place ""on or around 1 December 2004"" and that the acknowledgement of the investment was dated 6 December 2004.  Put at its highest and giving the evidence a precision which the statement lacks, its effect was that a document which appeared to be the same as the 04 IM was picked up by Mr Millner in the last few days of November, i.e. 28, 29 or 30. 
52That evidence would not have prevented the Crown from making any of the submissions which are criticised.  It would not prevent the Crown from submitting that the 04 version of the IM had not come into existence by 15 or 16 November 2004.  That submission was available because of the evidence of Mr Singer, supported as it was by correspondence that on 22, 26 and 29 November the IM was still in draft form and was subject to significant amendment.  In fact the statement of Mr Millner is not inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Singer.  There were clearly drafts of the IM in existence on 22 and 26 November but importantly, not on 15 or 16 November.
53The Crown did not contend that there was no IM in existence at all in November 2004.  On the contrary, the Crown led evidence from Mr Singer about the existence of a number of drafts of the IM in November 2004.  It was the Crown case that the 37 page finalised IM could not have existed before 29 November 2004 and therefore could not have been given to Mr Mookhy on 15 November 2004 and faxed to him on 16 November 2004, as claimed by the appellant.
54The Crown opened on this issue as follows:
""I expect there will be a number of different types of evidence led in the proceedings which will, I expect, establish that, that the Information Memorandum did not exist at the date in question, that is on 16 November 2004.  And the means by which, in the document and copy of an email annexed to the affidavit, it is (not transcribable) were means which again did not exist at that date, 16 November 2004"". (AB Vol 1 T.18-19)
55In closing addresses the Crown addressed on the significance of the detailed evidence of Mr Singer as follows:
""But the real point I submit about this is, putting that to one side, is it's clear, is it not, that the Information Memorandum copy that appears at p 122 and onwards of exhibit 1 just couldn't have existed before 29 November 2004.""  (AB Vol 4, T.1006)
56The handwritten amendments on the portions of the IM faxed by Mr Singer to the appellant on 29 November 2004 do not appear in drafts of the IM produced before that date but do appear in the finalised IM.  Therefore, the finalised IM, which the appellant claimed he faxed to Mr Mookhy on 16 November 2004, could not have existed before 29 November 2004.  It is notable that the finalised IM refers to ""CSL unsecured notes issue No 04"", whereas the earlier drafts all refer to ""CSL unsecured notes issue No 01"".  Mr Singer recalled this change from number 01 to number 04 occurring in ""late 2004"" (AB Vol 3 T.514).  The appellant himself said that the Information Memorandum ""in its complete form"" was finalised ""towards the end of November 2004, early December 2004"" (AB Vol 4, T.876).
57The evidence of Mr Mookhy that he did not receive by fax a copy of the 2004 version of the IM on 16 November 2004 was supported by the evidence of the falsification by the appellant of the fax records said by him to have come into existence on that date.  The conflict between the evidence of the appellant as to the delivery of the IM on 15 and 16 November 2004 (T.767.40, 768.23-.47, 769.47, 770.1-.49, 772.5, 838.47, 839.1-840.11) and that of Mr Mookhy and Mr Singer was a classic issue for the jury to resolve.  The evidence of Mr Millner, limited as it was to the end of November 2004, was irrelevant to that issue since it was not inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Mookhy, nor was it inconsistent with that of Mr Singer.
58A proper analysis of Mr Millner's statement indicates that its relevance was marginal at best and that it would not have had any real impact on the issue which the jury had to decide.
59A recent statement of the obligations of a prosecutor is in R v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279; 47 NSWLR 450 at [57] where Greg James J said:
""57   In summary, it is the duty of a prosecutor to determine what witnesses will be called. He has the responsibility for ensuring that the Crown case is properly presented. He also has the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused and to the court. He does not perform that duty by seeking to avoid having placed before the court evidence which he is not entitled to regard as unreliable and yet which ill accords with a theory of the accused's guilt.""
60Smart AJ said:
""102   At the risk of undue repetition these further principles should be noted: 
(a)  The Crown prosecutor in deciding how the Crown case will be presented and what oral evidence will be adduced has the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused: Richardson v The Queen (1974-75) 131 CLR at 119.
(b)  The Crown prosecutor will often have to take into account many factors, for example, whether the evidence of a particular witness is essential to the unfolding of the Crown case, whether it is credible and truthful, whether in the interests of justice it should be subject to cross-examination, amongst other matters: Richardson (at 119).
(c)  The prosecutor should decide in the particular case what are the relevant factors and in the light of those factors determine the course which will ensure a proper presentation of the Crown case comformably with the dictates of fairness to the accused: Richardson (at 119).
(d)  To avoid a miscarriage of justice, a Crown prosecutor should call all available material witnesses. They include those whose evidence is necessary to unfold the narrative and give a complete account of the events upon which the prosecution is based. In general, these witnesses will include the eye witnesses of any events which go to prove the elements of the crime and will include witnesses notwithstanding that they give accounts inconsistent with the Crown case: Whitehorn v The Queen 152 CLR 657 at 674 per Dawson J. (An exception exists where there are many witnesses to prove the same point.)
(e)  However, the Crown has a discretion not to call in the Crown case an eye witness if the prosecutor judges that there is sufficient reason for not calling the witness, as, for example, where the prosecutor concludes the witness is not reliable and trustworthy or is otherwise incapable of belief. This applies even to a witness who is essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based: R v Richardson (at 121) and Whitehorn v The Queen (at 674). 
(f)  The prosecutor's judgment must be based on more than a feeling or intuition. There must be identifiable factors pointing to unreliability or lack of belief in the proposed evidence of the witness. It is not enough that the prosecutor considers that the evidence may be unreliable. Suspicion, scepticism and errors on subsidiary matters will not suffice. The attention of the prosecutor should be on matters of substance and even on these there may be significant differences between the witnesses. It is for the jury to resolve these: R v Apostilides (at 576). 
(g)  ""In most cases where a prosecutor does not wish to lead evidence from a person named on the indictment"" [or able to give material evidence] but the defence wishes that person to be called, it will be sufficient for the prosecutor simply to call the person so that he may be cross-examined by the defendant and then, if necessary, be re-examined: R v Apostilides (at 576). 
(h)  Frequently, eye witnesses will be close or have been close to the accused and possibly to the victim. That does not mean that they should not be called by the Crown. It is where it is apparent that the eye witness is so devoted to the accused and his cause that she will not tell the truth as to what happened that the question of the Crown not calling that witness will arise. 
(i)  Overriding all the particular guidelines and formulations is the general obligation imposed upon a Crown prosecutor to act fairly in the discharge of the function which he performs. That is the guiding and fundamental principle to be kept in mind as new and unusual situations emerge: Whitehorn (at 675).""
Spigelman CJ agreed with the statements of principle by both Greg James J and Smart AJ.
61The application of those statements of principle to the facts of this case did not require that the Crown call Mr Millner.  He was not a material witness and his evidence was at best only marginally relevant.  There is, of course, the added difficulty for the appellant that he and his legal advisors were well aware of the contents of Mr Millner's statement and could have requested that he be called in the Crown case if they regarded his evidence as material or relevant to the defence case.  No such request was made.  Alternatively, they could have called Mr Millner in the defence case.  The failure to make such a request of the Crown and the failure to call Mr Millner in the defence case have not been explained.
62It follows that the evidence of Mr Millner if led at trial would not have improved the appellant's chances of achieving an acquittal on any of the fraud counts or on the false affidavit count.  The prosecution did not, by not calling him, cause a miscarriage of justice and did not prevent an hypothesis consistent with innocence from being left to the jury.
63Ground 2 of the appeal related to the admission of the statement of Mr Millner as fresh evidence.  This ground of appeal appears to be misconceived.  The issue is not whether this Court should receive as fresh evidence on the appeal the statement of Mr Millner, but whether it is evidence which should be heard by a jury in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.   Clearly this Court needs to admit the evidence on a conditional basis in order to evaluate its effect.
64The considerations which guide a Court of Criminal Appeal in deciding whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred because evidence now available was not led at trial have been considered on a number of occasions, e.g. Gallagher v R [1986] HCA 26; 160 CLR 392; Mickelberg v R [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259; R v Abu-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 and GAR v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163 at [26]. 
65Usually a conviction will not be set aside if the evidence relied upon could with reasonable diligence have been produced by the accused at trial.  Quite clearly Mr Millner's statement was available at the time of trial and its existence was known by the appellant's legal advisors.  That consideration does not assist the appellant.
66The other consideration is whether the evidence, if believed, might reasonably have led the jury to return a different verdict.  Put another way, a Court of Criminal Appeal will not intervene unless the evidence is ""of such cogency that innocence is shown to the court's satisfaction or the court entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt"".  (R v Abu-Chabake at [63].)   As already indicated, the evidence of Mr Millner was not of that quality.
67The conclusion I have reached is that the evidence sought to be relied upon was not ""fresh"" in any relevant sense and that there was no miscarriage of justice flowing from the fact that it was not presented to the jury.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground of Appeal 3:  The conviction on the failure to account charges (s 178 Crimes Act 1900) was infected by the evidence of the perjury charge.  Her Honour unfairly refused to grant an application for separate trials.
68The appellant accepted that he had no defence to the false affidavit count.  Accordingly, once the evidence of that matter had been adduced, he submitted that any prospect of his evidence being accepted on other issues by the jury (however truthful it might have been) was lost.  It was only a short step for the jury to conclude that he was not telling the truth about the IM.  The appellant submitted by reference to what was said in R v O'Connor (1992) 59 A Crim R 278 at 287 the jury's consideration of the fraud counts must have been so infected by the offence touching the false affidavit count as to render its verdict on the fraud counts unsafe and unsatisfactory.  The appellant submitted that her Honour should have appreciated that and ordered separate trials.
69In making that submission, the appellant conceded that even if the false affidavit count had not been heard at the same time as the fraud counts, it would have been open to the Crown to adduce evidence about it so that the evidence on that issue would have been before the jury in any event.  That was a concession properly made.
70Her Honour rejected the appellant's application for separate trials in a short judgment delivered on 26 October 2009.  The basis for her Honour's decision was the closeness of the relationship between the fraud counts and the false affidavit count.  Her Honour considered that the potential prejudice could be dealt with by a strong direction to the jury.
71Her Honour was empowered by s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to order a separate trial of any count or counts in an indictment if she were of the opinion:
(a) That an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment; or
(b) That for any reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment.
72The test of whether joinder of counts is appropriate was considered in R v McCarthy (1984) 14 A Crim R 155.  There Street CJ approved the following statement of principle from R v Assim [1966] 2 QB 249 at 261:
""As a general rule it is, of course, no more proper to have tried by the same jury several offenders on charges of committing individual offences that have nothing to do with each other than it is to try before the same jury offences committed by the same persons that have nothing to do with each other.  Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are upon the available evidence so related, whether in time or by other factors, that the interests of justice are best served by them being tried together, then they can properly be the subject of counts in one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together.""
73In the particular circumstances of this case when the evidence as to the false evidence could and would have been led in any event, the appellant has not established any relevant prejudice or embarrassment by reason of the fraud counts being tried at the same time as the false affidavit count.  The fraud counts and the false affidavit count were so related by a range of factors, that the interests of justice were best served by them being tried together.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground of Appeal 4:  Her Honour failed to properly direct the jury in regard to the distinction between the receipt of funds for personal use and the receipt of funds by the corporation in the course of business when she could and should have done so.
74The appellant submitted that her Honour had failed to properly direct the jury in regard to the distinction between the receipt of funds for personal use by the appellant and the receipt of funds by a corporation in the course of business.  In particular, the appellant submitted, that her Honour had not advised the jury that the appellant had received no personal benefit from the money paid by Mr Mookhy to CSL.  The appellant agreed that no point was taken at trial concerning her Honour's direction on this issue.  Accordingly, leave pursuant to r 4 is required.
75Comprehensive directions were given by the trial judge on the question of the distinction between the receipt of funds personally as distinct from receiving them as a representative or employee of a company.  These directions were given after extensive discussions between her Honour and counsel (AB Vol 4, SU D1, pp 41-49; AB Vol 4, SU D2, pp 1-14).
76The approach followed by her Honour was to provide the jury with a written direction (MFI's 20 and 25) which set out the elements of the offence constituted by the fraud counts and then to explain those elements of the offence.  The elements identified by her Honour were:
(i) The accused received money from Avinash Mr Mookhy.
(ii) At the time that the accused received the money from Mr Mookhy it was on terms that the accused was to account for that money by lending it in accordance with the faxes referred to in the charges.
(iii) The accused failed to account for the money - that is he failed to lend the money to the named persons.
(iv) At the time the accused failed to account for the money he was fraudulent.
77These directions were correct.  
(a) The Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant received the sums of money referred to in the fraud counts from Mr Mookhy (R v Francipane (NSWCCA, unreported, 23 December 1998 at p 10).  
(b) The Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant received the money personally, not as an employee or representative of any of the companies in the Trust Group (R v Maharaj (1995) 85 A Crim R 374 at 380-381).  
(c) Where a person controls a company and personally controls the receipt of monies by the company and the disposition of that money, he will be capable of receiving that money personally, rather than as a mere representative or employee of the company (R v Moran (1991) 52 A Crim R 440 at 441; R v J (1987) 9 NSWLR 615 at 623).
(d) It is not the law that a payment to a company, e.g. a cheque in favour of the company - received by a director is necessarily received by him as a representative of the company (R v Moran at 442; R v J at 623).
78As can be seen from the above statement of the elements of the offence, whether or not the appellant personally gained from the transaction may be a background fact which would assist in the establishment of an element of the offence, but it is not itself an element of the offence and did not have to be specifically referred to by her Honour.  In relation to the fourth element of the offence, her Honour said in her written direction (MFI 25):
""This element and all of the elements of the offences, must be found by you beyond reasonable doubt.  That is, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time that the accused received the money from Mr Mookhy he was acting for his own personal purposes and not acting on behalf of the company.  If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that then you cannot find this element proved and you must find the accused not guilty.""
79I am not satisfied that there was anything in her Honour's written or oral directions which required correction or amendment and I would refuse leave pursuant to r 4 for the appellant to rely upon this ground of appeal.
Sentence AppealGround of Appeal 5:  The sentencing judge did not have before her the facts relating to the disadvantage that non-Australian citizens have in relation to harsher prison conditions.
80In support of this ground of appeal, the appellant sought leave to rely upon his affidavit as to prison conditions (MFI 3) and on a letter from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC), dated 29 September 2010 (MFI 4).  The letter from DIAC advised that ""it is also unlikely that any visa cancellation consideration will formally commence until approximately 12 months prior to your earliest date of release.""
81In passing sentence on 23 April 2010, her Honour summarised the appellant's subjective case as follows:  He was aged 32 and had left his home in Austria when aged 21 and had come to live in Australia.  He had a Masters degree in Economics and had always been in employment.  He had no previous criminal convictions.
82A number of persons wrote to the court attesting to his good character and to the effect that he had always acted honestly and decently.  They said that the frauds were uncharacteristic of him.  The appellant did not give evidence but wrote a letter to the court in which he expressed regret and some remorse for what had occurred.
83Her Honour noted that the appellant had been made bankrupt and that his marriage was faltering.  Her Honour also noted that in one of the testimonials it was explained that the convictions for fraud and perjury would effectively bring to an end the appellant's ability to work in the finance area, which in turn would create difficulties for him on his release from prison.
84The individual sentences imposed by her Honour were as follows.  On the charge of destruction of documents, the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 10 months.  On the charge of perjury committed in the Supreme Court, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months.  On the charge of perjury of which he was convicted by the jury, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year and 6 months.  In relation to each of the first four counts of fraud, the appellant was sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months.  On the fifth count of fraud, he was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 months, which would expire on 1 September 2014 and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months which would expire on 1 December 2016.  Accordingly the earliest date for his release to parole was 1 September 2014.  As previously indicated, the effect of the sentences passed by her Honour was imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months.
85It was the appellant's submission that an error had occurred in the sentencing process because it had not been brought to her Honour's attention that as a non-Australian citizen, he may in due course have his visa cancelled.  This meant that he would be disadvantaged in comparison with other prisoners while serving his sentence.  The nature of the disadvantage was that he was unlikely to be moved to a C2 or C3 classification, which would allow him to be housed in a minimum security facility and to perform work on and off the correctional centre facility.  In his affidavit the appellant asserted that he would be required to spend most of his time in custody in a maximum security facility despite being classified as a minimum security risk.
86It was not submitted that her Honour had erred in failing to take account of this material since it had not been placed before her.  The submission was that this material should have been placed before her Honour and if so, it would have produced a lighter sentence.  Alternatively it was fresh evidence which had only come to light after the sentencing proceedings and should now be taken into account by this Court.
87The alternative submission cannot succeed.  The evidence sought to be relied upon was clearly not ""fresh"".  The policy of DIAC towards non-Australian citizens in custody could have easily been obtained and placed before the court in a letter. The policy of the Department of Corrective Services to non-Australian citizens when in custody could also have been obtained and placed before the Court in a similar way.  This was not done.  The failure to do so has not been explained.
88Given the seriousness of the offences, the likelihood that DIAC would consider revocation was at least more probable than not.  In that circumstance, any departmental policy contingent upon that fact would be implemented.  All of that was information readily available to be considered on sentencing and, if the applicant had wished that it be taken into account, it should have been raised with the sentencing judge but was not.
89The evidence sought to be relied upon by the appellant to establish these issues is unsatisfactory.  The letter from DIAC simply advises that no decision will be made about his visa until 12 months before he is due to be released.  The remaining evidence is in the form of second-hand anonymous hearsay (MFI 3, par 20-29).  Put at its highest, it raises speculative considerations about administrative arrangements which may or may not be made in relation to the appellant's future classification and location within the prison system.  
90Annexure ""N"" to MFI 3 is a letter from Legal Aid NSW to the appellant dated 23 June 2011.  It is a response to certain inquiries by the appellant.  It states:
""... Although Corrective Services says that in these circumstances, progression to C3 will be considered on its merits, this will only happen if DIAC has made a decision that the person will not be deported.
You should write to the address below and request that a decision be made now on whether or not your visa will be cancelled.  You should mention in the letter: (1) Your classification, in particular, progression to minimum security and access to leave programs, is being held up because there is no decision from DIAC; and (2) The date you came to Australia, how long you have been living here, when you married, if you have children here, if the marriage is still on foot, work you have done here and plan to do when released and where and with whom you plan to live here when released ...""
The address given was that of DIAC.  Accordingly, the appellant's progression within the prison system is by no means clear.
91The situation is analogous to that where a reduction in sentence is sought because much or part of a sentence will be served in protection.  The observations of Howie J (with whom McColl JA and Studdert J agreed) in R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97; 145 A Crim R 304 at [179 - 180] are apposite:
""179 The material raises once again the issue of what mitigation of a sentence should be made on the basis that the offender might spend all or some of his sentence in protective custody. The matter has been recently considered in R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207 and R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299. It can no longer be assumed that a prisoner, by reason of the fact that he will serve his sentence on protection, will find prison life more difficult or onerous than other prisoners in the general prison population or that the prisoner will be deprived of amenities or opportunities for self improvement courses and education. The present is another instance where a sentencing judge has presumably taken into account in favour of the offender the fact that he will serve his sentence under the harsh conditions and deprivations of protective custody, but that has not proved to be the case. It is an example of the difficulty of a sentencing court taking into account possible executive or administrative action in respect of a prisoner's custody when predicting how a sentence will be served. Although in Durocher-Yvon the Court indicated that a sentencing judge was entitled to assume that an informer would find himself in strict protection for the best part, if not the whole, of his sentence, that assumption would have proved to be erroneous in the present case.
180 As was recognised in Totten, the court is placed in a difficult position. On the one hand, the sentencer should take into account the conditions of the prisoner's custody where it appears that they will be unduly onerous because of some matter particular to that prisoner. This requires that, at the time of sentence, the court make some prediction about the nature of the custody that will be endured by the prisoner. On the other hand, the courts should now be aware that assumptions or predictions, which have been made in the past about the nature of an offender's custody because, for example, the offender has given assistance to the authorities, no longer hold good. But the vagaries of prison life are such that it could never be confidently assumed or predicted that a prisoner will serve the whole of his sentence in any particular type of custodial arrangement.""
92The issue is whether, even if the additional evidence sought to be relied upon is taken into account, this Court should now re-open the sentence, there being no error on the part of the sentencing judge in failing to make allowance for the hardship referred to.
93Whether or not the appellant's visa will be revoked remains speculative.  If it is not revoked, he will proceed through the prison system in the conventional way.  There also seems to be a difference of opinion between Legal Aid NSW and the Department of Corrective Services.  The Department of Corrective Services seems to be saying that the appellant's progression to C3 will be considered on its merits, Legal Aid is of the opinion that this is contingent upon a favourable decision being given by DIAC.  
94This raises the very issue identified in Mostyn at [180] in that the Court is asked to carry out some kind of predictive exercise based on evidence which is uncertain at best.  In those circumstances I have concluded, that even if the additional evidence sought to be relied upon by the appellant had been before her Honour, or was before this Court, I would not interfere with the sentence which her Honour passed.
Conclusion
95Since all of the conviction appeal grounds raise mixed questions of fact and law, the leave of this Court is required for those matters to go forward.  The Court has heard detailed argument in relation to these grounds, but none of them has been made out.  In those circumstances, I would grant leave to appeal in respect of Grounds 1 and 3 but would dismiss the appeal.  I would refuse leave to appeal in respect of Grounds 2 and 4.  In relation to the sentence appeal, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
96Accordingly, the orders which I propose are:Conviction Appeal  (1) Leave to appeal is granted in respect of Grounds 1 and 3, but the appeal is dismissed.(2) Leave to appeal is refused in respect of Grounds 2 and 4.
Sentence Appeal(1) Leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.
97McCALLUM J:  I agree with Hoeben JA.

2759608,Wykamp v R [2012] NSWCCA 145,"Judgment
1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Button J.
2Price J: I agree with Button J.
3Button J:
Introduction
4On 6 September 2011 in the District Court at Orange, Judge Neilson convicted Peter Andrew John Wykamp (""the applicant""), pursuant to a plea of guilty, of one count of threatening to injure Constable Miles Burden with intent to hinder the lawful detention of Mitchell Wykamp while in company. The charge was brought pursuant to s 33B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. It attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years. There was no applicable standard non-parole period. Immediately thereafter, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of imprisonment for 18 months, with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 12 months. It can be seen that a slight adjustment was made to the length of the non-parole period on the basis of a finding of special circumstances; if that had not occurred, the non-parole period would have been 13 months and 2 weeks. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence to this Court. 
Objective features
5Eugowra is a small country town of about 500 citizens located between Orange and Forbes. As at Boxing Day 2010, Constable Burden was the sole police officer stationed in the town. In the evening of that day he travelled to Canowindra to assist with rising floodwaters. He returned to Eugowra at about 12:30am on 27 December 2010. That town was also endangered by floods.
6Constable Burden was informed that a vehicle had been seen driving erratically. Very shortly after, a vehicle consistent with the description given drove past. Constable Burden stopped the vehicle. The driver was the young son of the applicant. He was on his provisional license. Mitchell Wykamp returned a roadside breath reading of 0.115. He was arrested, handcuffed and placed in the rear of the caged police vehicle. 
7Meanwhile the applicant was at his business, preparing for the flood. As soon as he was told about the arrest of his son, he, along with others, ran to the police vehicle.
8It is convenient from this stage to quote precisely from the statement of Agreed Facts that was tendered in the proceedings on sentence:
""At this stage the Accused said to Constable BURDEN: ""Let my son out please"". Someone then said ""You better fucking let him out or your life won't be worth living"". Constable BURDEN said to the Accused, ""I can't do that, he's arrested for drink drinking"". The Accused said, ""I don't give a fuck. Everyone is drink driving, let him out now"". . 
Constable BURDEN formed the view from the Accused's actions, the smell of intoxicating liquor, the slurring his words and his unsteadiness on his feet that the Accused was well affected by alcohol.
Constable BURDEN noticed that about 10 other people had gathered around him and the police vehicle. He remained focused however on the Accused as the actions of the Accused caused him to fear that he would be assaulted.
Constable BURDEN could hear other people in the crowd also yelling at him. ""You were alright until now. Now you're fucked"" and ""Are you stupid, did you forget we know where you live!"" It was at this time that Constable BURDEN formed the opinion that he may be seriously injured.
Constable BURDEN attempted to call for assistance however in his portable radio did not have coverage. The Accused was still standing in front of Constable BURDEN, yelling at him ""You don't know what you're doing, you're not in fucking Sydney anymore, let him out.""
Constable BURDEN was forced to push his way past the Accused to get to the police vehicle to use the police radio. When he did this, Constable BURDEN was followed by the Accused. After Constable BURDEN had requested assistance via the Police radio he was effectively pinned against the passenger door of the police vehicle with Accused waving his arms as he yelled at him, ""Look around, everyone is fucking pissed. Go breath test us all you cunt. We are out here trying to save the town. Where the fuck have you been all night. You then come in here and want to start arresting people. That's not right. Let him out"". Constable BURDEN said, ""He's not getting out. I know everyone has been drinking, he was just the first car I stopped"". . 
Constable BURDEN was becoming more and more concerned about his welfare and he states that he was in fear of being assaulted by the Accused. Constable BURDEN asked the Accused to step back and attempted to push him away but this was unsuccessful.
One of the SES volunteers approached the group and he too was asking people to move away. Constable BURDEN then noted that members of the group started yelling abuse at that SES volunteer. It was at this time that Constable BURDEN formed the view that it may not only be himself that would be harmed and the way to ""de-escalate"" the situation was to release his prisoner, Mitchell.
Constable BURDEN said to the ACCUSED, ""Okay, I'll let him out"". The Accused said, ""Good. That's the right thing to do. You're doing the right thing"". Constable BURDEN walked to the left hand side of the rear cage and released the young man and noticed that he walked away with his mother, the Accused's wife.
After this happened, the group of people quickly dispersed. The Accused then shook Constable BURDEN's hand and said ""Thank you"""".
9It is not in dispute in the proceedings that Constable Burden believed that he would have been seriously harmed if he had not freed the son of the applicant. 
10The applicant was arrested on 30 December 2010. 
11He took part in an interview about what had occurred. During that interview, the applicant conceded that he knew that, as a result of obtaining the release of his son from the caged vehicle, his son would not have to be subjected to a breath analysis.
Subjective features
12The applicant pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. He was given a discount of 25 per cent with regard to the utilitarian value of that plea.
13As for the question of remorse, there were a number of important pieces of evidence. First, on arrest, a few days after the commission of the offence, the applicant said ""This is a fucking joke"" and ""He's only been there for four months, what the fuck would he know"". Secondly, in the ERISP, the applicant did not admit all that he ultimately admitted in the proceedings on sentence. Thirdly, a pre-sentence report was tendered in the proceedings on sentence. The following appears within that document:
""Attitude to the Offence
In discussing the offence the offender relayed that at that time he reacted in defence of his son. He further asserted a degree of animosity towards the local police officer and justified his actions.""
14Fourthly, the applicant gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence of 5 September 2011. The following exchanges occurred:
""Q. What about your attitude towards Constable Burden, how did you feel about what had occurred to him that night? A.  Yeah - oh just didn't - I know I shouldn't have done it, I'm sorry I've done it and - yeah, ashamed. Letting the community down and - especially the fire brigade.
...
Q. And your behaviour it's suggested that you're not sorry for it or ashamed for it but you're only ashamed for your - you're only sorry that you've been caught and subjected yourself to this trouble, what is the case are you genuinely sorry about that?A. Genuinely sorry, I've upset the township, I've really upset the fire brigade and the local captain there, my father was captain for 50 years so - yeah.""
15In the remarks on sentence, his Honour made the following findings with regard to remorse:
""As to mitigating factors, there is clearly the plea of guilty entered by the offender. I remain diffident, if not sceptical, about true contrition and remorse. What the Court is concerned with is victim empathy. What the Court is concerned with is whether the offender realises what he did to Constable Burden, how Constable Burden would have felt being surrounded by the people he was called upon to protect and care for and threatened by them. Clearly the offender is contrite because he has been called to account for his actions. He is contrite because part of his actions caused a police crackdown on the local community and a lot of people were charged with driving offences and the like in the police crackdown on Eugowra, and that, no doubt, generated some ill will amongst his fellow townsmen to the offender. No doubt he feels remorseful about that. However, I remain as I said, sceptical about whether there was true victim empathy.""
16The applicant was born on 25 May 1966 and was therefore 45 years of age on the day he stood for sentence. He was very highly regarded in Eugowra; indeed, it could be said he was a leading citizen of that town. The applicant was a successful businessman, member of the Lions Club and Apex Club, and active in the local Rugby League Club. He was the Deputy Captain of the local Bush Fire Brigade, and had been a member of that Brigade for some 30 years.  He had stood down from that position whilst the proceedings were pending. There was a plethora of evidence of the esteem in which the applicant was held by his fellow citizens.
17Having said that, his criminal record was not unblemished. In 2001, the applicant had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 18 months with a non-parole period of 10 months in the District Court for an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. The facts of that offence were not placed before his Honour. His Honour, generously in my opinion, regarded that offence as ""spent"" and declined to take it into account. 
18Pursuant to conditional bail, the applicant was prohibited for some time from living in Eugowra and ended up in Queensland. Eventually he was permitted to return to his lifelong home in the area in which his family had resided for decades.
Procedural history
19In the proceedings on sentence, counsel for the applicant (who also appeared in this Court) submitted that a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years or less was open to the discretion of his Honour. Furthermore, counsel submitted that a suspended sentence would be an appropriate disposition of the matter. The solicitor then appearing for the respondent conceded that his Honour would not be falling into appellable error if such a sentence were to be imposed. His Honour took time to reflect on the sentence overnight. 
20In remarks on sentence that I respectfully regard as comprehensive and considered, his Honour said with regard to the ultimate disposition of the matter:
""A large amount of time has been spent on discussing the objective seriousness of this offence, or perhaps I should have said the seriousness of this offence. There is no standard non-parole period. True it is that there is no actual violence, no actual weapon. There was only the threat of violence. But there is a clear determination to have Constable Burden act otherwise than in accordance of his duty, to act contrary to his sworn duty and to override his standing in the community, to override his position as the sole authority of the Crown in the town of Eugowra upholding law and order.
The offender would, but for this event, be described, quite properly, as a leading member of the community, a pillar of its society, a civic leader. However, it is incumbent upon those holding such positions in the community to give to those in authority their support and respect. It has been submitted on behalf of the offender that I should impose a suspended sentence pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Crown has accepted that that is within my statutory discretion. I have great sympathy for that submission. I have no doubt that a suspended sentence would be sufficient to deter this offender from ever again committing this offence. Indeed, I have no doubt that whatever penalty I impose, whether it be a small fine or a s 9 bond, would be more than sufficient to deter Peter Wykamp from doing again what he has done and for which he now stands for sentence.""
21A little later his Honour remarked:
""I am afraid that were I to pass a suspended sentence upon this offender, I would not be carrying out my duty to deter members of the public from acting in a similar fashion, to how this offender acted, unfortunately, on 27 December 2010. I would not be denouncing his conduct. The citizens of Eugowra would look upon the offender as having been caned with a feather. The members of the New South Wales Police would look upon themselves as completely unsupported by the Court in doing their often demanding, dangerous and largely thankless task.""
22Shortly after that, his Honour imposed the sentence now under consideration. 
Grounds
23Two grounds have been notified. One asserts patent error and one asserts latent error. For convenience I shall deal with the ground asserting latent error last. 
Ground Two""That the learned sentencing Judge erred in his findings regarding the Appellant's lack of remorse and contrition.""
24The submissions of the applicant in truth raised two related issues concerning the topic of remorse: first, whether an error of fact occurred in the findings of his Honour in the remarks on sentence and recited above; and, secondly, whether the sentence failed adequately to take into account contrition and remorse. As for the latter issue, I regard it as in truth a particular of Ground One, and will deal with it in my discussion of that ground.
25As for the former issue, I consider that the reticent approach of his Honour was reasonably open on all of the evidence. I refer to the things said by the applicant on arrest, the failure to fully admit his actions in the ERISP, the contents of the pre-sentence report, and the two portions of the evidence of the applicant to which I have referred. In particular, that evidence could be said to suggest a regret on the part of the applicant that his offence had caused trouble and inconvenience to himself and the town, rather than reflecting an acceptance of the harm done not only to the police officer but also to the maintenance of the law in Eugowra. Finally, it should be noted that his Honour had the opportunity to observe the way in which the applicant gave all of his evidence, including with regard to this topic, an opportunity of course denied to this Court.
26I would reject Ground Two.
Ground One""That the Sentence was, in all respects, manifestly excessive having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence.""
27In support of this Ground, counsel for the applicant invited attention to the remarkable subjective circumstances, not least of which was the fact that the town was in the middle of a flood emergency at the time of the commission of the offence. He eloquently emphasised the leading role that the applicant played in the town, and submitted that, in truth, the sentence imposed did not reflect the remorse of the applicant. He submitted that a suspended sentence could even now be imposed; in the alternative he submitted that the sentence could be shortened, both with regard to the total term and the non-parole period, with the effect that the applicant would be released immediately.
28Counsel for the applicant referred the Court to the decisions of R v William John Murray [2008] NSWDC 285 and R v Sainsbury [2000] NSWCCA 496. The Crown referred to R v Hamilton (1993) 66 A Crim R 575.
Decision
29I shall deal first with the three cases to which the Court was taken.
30In R v Hamilton, the offender was convicted after trial of an offence of using an offensive instrument with intent to prevent lawful apprehension. In short, he had driven a stolen motor vehicle directly at a police officer, missing him by less than 30cm. For that offence, the offender received a total term of imprisonment for 3 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months, within a larger sentence structure. In a well-known passage, Gleeson CJ (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Ireland J agreed) emphasised that offences against s 33B are viewed extremely seriously by the Court of Criminal Appeal. An appeal against sentence was dismissed.
31In R v Sainsbury, the Crown appealed against a sentence of 100 hours of community service that had been imposed for an offence of using an instrument to prevent apprehension. In short, the offender had driven a stolen motor vehicle directly at a police vehicle that contained a police officer who was partly out of the vehicle. The subjective circumstances were compelling, and included the fact that the offender had experienced the murder of her mother when the offender was aged 14 years. Dunford J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Carruthers J agreed) regarded the case as wholly exceptional. Applying principles of double jeopardy then applicable, and taking into account the fact that the 100 hours community service had already been served, the Court upheld the Crown appeal and sentenced the offender to imprisonment by way of periodic detention for 18 months with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 12 months.
32In R v Murray, the offender was convicted after trial of, amongst other offences, an offence of attempting to use an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension. In short, the offender violently resisted when two police officers attempted to arrest him. That resistance included the offender seeking to take the loaded pistol of one of the police officers in order to use it to prevent his apprehension. With regard to that offence, a total term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 12 months was imposed. That sentence formed part of a larger sentence structure. It is noteworthy that R v Murray is a sentence of the District Court at first instance, and is therefore not binding upon this Court, but merely forms part of a large range of first instance decisions.
33Consideration of the three decisions to which the Court was invited does not lead me to the view that the sentence under consideration is manifestly excessive. 
34As noted above, in the District Court, counsel for the applicant submitted that a suspended sentence would be appropriate, and the solicitor for the respondent did not submit that such a sentence would be an error. It may well be that such a sentence was reasonably open to the discretion of his Honour, and that such a sentence would not have attracted a Crown appeal. However, that is not the test that this Court is called upon to apply. It is incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence actually imposed by his Honour itself bespeaks error in the exercise of his Honour's discretion. That is a high hurdle for the applicant to clear.
35I accept the powerful subjective circumstances, not the least of which was the stress and upset caused by the rising waters. I also accept that it is regrettable that a leading member of the community within a small country town has suffered the degradation of imprisonment. 
36However, I consider that the offence committed by the applicant was a serious one. The gravity of a police officer being overawed by threats of violence emanating from a group of people, with the result that a person is released who has been lawfully detained, is apparent. The situation was heightened by the geographical and physical isolation of the police officer. Although it could be said that threats of violence did not emanate directly from the mouth of the applicant, but rather from those with whom he was acting in company, I have no doubt that the behaviour and language of the applicant was designed to intimidate, and it achieved its goal. 
37In the circumstances, I do not consider that the decision to impose a sentence of fulltime imprisonment was inherently erroneous. I am of the same view with regard to the length of the total term and the non-parole period. It follows that I would reject Ground One.
Orders
38I propose the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal granted.
(2)Appeal dismissed.

2759615,Director of Public Prosecutions v Razzak [2012] NSWLC 9,"Judgment

1The offender, Omar Razzak, is before the Court for sentencing in respect of an offence of reckless wounding. That offence was committed on 1 December 2011 whilst the offender was subject to four good behaviour bonds under section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ('the Act').

The offence of reckless wounding.

2The offender pleaded guilty to the charge under section 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 of recklessly wounding Christopher Ristov on 1 December 2011 at Kogarah. The maximum penalty for this offence is 7 years imprisonment with a jurisdictional limit of 2 years imprisonment.

3The agreed facts are as follows. At about 7pm on 1 December 2011, the victim was walking alone along Rocky Point Road at Kogarah. As he reached the Perea Greek Restaurant near the intersection of Shaw Street, he was confronted by three males, one of whom was the offender.

4The offender stood in front of the victim and asked, ""What are you doing? Do you have five bucks?"" The victim replied, ""Who's that?"" The offender said, ""Omar cuz"". The victim then said, ""Omar who?"" to which the offender replied, ""Omar from Hurstville"". The victim had met the offender and seen him on previous occasions in the Hurstville and Brighton area. The offender continued to ask the victim for money. The victim attempted to walk away from the offender and refused to give him any money. The offender then pushed the victim to his chest area with open palms and said, ""You think you're a mad cunt walking away"".

5The victim walked further along Rocky Point Road and stopped at the Perea Greek restaurant. The offender and his companions followed the victim to the restaurant. The victim said to a staff member of the restaurant, ""I'm having a few dramas with these boys here. Can I stand here for a bit until my brother comes?"" The male staff member replied, ""We have people here, this is a restaurant"". He ushered the victim out of the restaurant.

6As the victim was fearful, he moved a few metres from the restaurant and used his mobile phone to call his father. His mother answered and said his father was not at home. The victim then called his friend, Michael Semrani, and told him he was on Rocky Point Road and was being ""harassed by lebos"". At this stage, the offender and his companions were grabbing at the victim's pockets. The victim asked Mr Semrani to pick him up.

7Whilst the victim was on the phone, the offender said words to the effect of, ""Come around the corner you bitch cunt"". The victim ran back to the restaurant and asked the staff member again if he could stand there for five minutes until his brother arrived. The offender followed and continued to harass the victim. The staff member from the restaurant again told the victim, ""Get out of here"". The staff member ushered the victim away.

8At this time, the offender approached the staff member outside the restaurant. Whilst the offender was momentarily distracted, the victim ran to the house of his friend, Alex, which was on Austral Street, some 30 to 40 metres from the restaurant. When he arrived there, the victim saw a friend, Nick, outside the house. The victim said, ""I'm going to drop Omar, right fucking now"".

9About two minutes later, the victim saw his friend, Michael Semrani, and four other males pull up in a car on Rocky Point Road. The victim and Alex ran back up Austral Street towards Rocky Point Road, where he saw the offender.

10The victim started walking up towards the offender and yelled to the offender, ""You wanna fight, let's fight"". The victim then ran to the offender and tried to kick him in the head. The offender moved out of the way. The offender then produced a knife and stabbed the victim once to his left rib area. The offender and the two persons with him then ran away.

11The victim applied pressure to the wound that had just been caused under his left armpit. He ran to Mr Semrani's car and was taken to the emergency department of St George Hospital. The victim was treated with the insertion of a chest drain that withdrew 200ml of blood. He had air and blood in his left chest cavity consistent with the penetrating wound. He was discharged from hospital six days later.

12Offences of reckless wounding generally may be regarded as serious crimes. They necessarily involve violence and injury to a victim and therefore warrant emphasis in the sentencing proceedings on general deterrence. Furthermore, this offence was committed in two circumstances of aggravation. 

13Firstly, the offence was committed with a weapon, namely a knife. The law recognises that an offence of reckless wounding can be committed without resort to a weapon: R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 351 at [32]. The Court of Criminal Appeal has frequently held that the use of a knife especially aggravates the offence: Nowak v R [2008] NSWCCA 89; R v Dickinson [2004] NSWCCA 457 at [23]; R v Reid (2005) 155 A Crim R 428 at [25]. It is trite to observe that the use of a knife in an emotionally volatile situation increases the potential for danger and the penalty that is liable to be imposed: R v Hampton [1999] NSWCCA 341 at [10]. Any assault involving the use of a knife calls for a significant sentence for the purposes of both specific and general deterrence: R v Watt (unreported, 2 April 1997, NSWCCA). The use of the knife to inflict a wound to the chest area under the left armpit is particularly serious. It involves an area of the body with some proximity to the heart and lungs. The victim had a penetrating wound from which it seems blood and air entered the chest cavity and had to be drained. Although there was just the one action involving the knife, it is difficult to conceive a more serious injury which would not support a more serious charge.

14In this case, the need for specific deterrence to be reflected in the sentence is particularly enlivened by the offender's criminal history. The offender's relevant history is constituted by matters dealt with in the Children's Court. These offences are admissible in these proceedings by virtue of section 15(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and the fact of the offender having been convicted on 24 June 2010 of an offence of possess prohibited drug: R v Tapueluelu [2006] NSWCCA 113 at [13]. The offender's record reveals that, whilst a juvenile, he was sentenced on 28 March 2006 for being in custody of a knife on 8 August 2005 and for robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon on 10 March 2006.

15The second circumstance of aggravation is that this offence was committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty by virtue of the section 9 good behaviour bonds.

16On behalf of the offender, there were three main circumstances of mitigation relied upon. Firstly, it was contended that the offence was committed under provocation from the victim or even committed in excessive self defence. That is, it was argued that the victim could have extricated himself from the scene, but instead he returned with Alex following him and attempted to kick the offender in the head.

17Not much weight ought to be given to provocation or excessive self defence in this case. It was the offender who, whilst in the company of two others, persistently harassed the victim in a manner that was conceded to be intimidatory. The victim twice unsuccessfully sought refuge from the offender in the restaurant and had made phone calls to family members to be picked up. When the victim managed to flee, it was only 30 or 40 metres away in circumstances where the offender and his associates remained in the vicinity. The victim returned to the offender's location only about two minutes afterwards. Any hiatus between the initial behaviour of the offender and the response by the victim was brief. It would be artificial to allow the defendant much mitigation by virtue of provocation or excessive self defence in circumstances where the victim's actions were provoked in direct response to the offender's behaviour towards him shortly beforehand.

18The second circumstance of mitigation relied upon is the offender's age. The offender was 21 years old at the time of the commission of this offence. He is now 22. Generally young adults enjoy good prospects of rehabilitation. However, the youth of an offender does not automatically lead to a reduced sentence. The more grave the offence, the less likely it is that retribution and general deterrence will cede to the interests of rehabilitation: JT v R [2011] NSWCCA 128 at [34]-[35].

19The third circumstance of mitigation was the offender's plea of guilty. The plea was entered on 24 May 2012, the seventh occasion the matter was before the Court. A more serious charge was withdrawn by the prosecution and the charge of reckless wounding was first before the Court on that date. Twice a brief had been ordered in the preceding mentions. It was conceded that a discount of 20 percent is attracted by the plea: R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32].

20The plea of guilty ordinarily also provides some evidence of remorse. Here, the offender was recognised by the victim and was identified by the victim in a photographic identification parade, so there might also be recognition of a strong prosecution case involved in the plea. Furthermore, the Pre-Sentence Report states the offender told the author of the report that he was not present at the time of the commission of the offence. It was contested on behalf of the offender that, because the plea of guilty was maintained, little weight should be placed on that comment and there was no attempt to traverse the plea of guilty. Whilst this circumstance will not greatly impact on the determination of the appropriate sentence, it is troubling to consider the offender's prospects of rehabilitation when his insight would seem to be minimal.

The section 9 bonds.

21On 11 January 2011, the Court imposed four good behaviour bonds under section 9 of the Act for a period of 12 months. It was a condition of those bonds that the offender accept Probation Service supervision for as long as considered necessary by that Service.

22The breaches of three of the four bonds by the commission of the offence of reckless wounding on 1 December 2011 are admitted and proven against the offender. The remaining bond of the four bonds was imposed in error.

23The bonds were imposed in respect of the following offences:
(1)Intentionally or recklessly damage property by fire on 8 June 2010 [section 195(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900];
(2)Light a fire upon railway premises on 9 June 2010 [clause 38(a) Rail Safety (Offences) Regulation 2008];
(3)Intentionally or recklessly damage property by means of fire on 18 July 2010 [section 195(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900]; and
(4)Intentionally or recklessly damage property by means of fire on 19 July 2010 [section 195(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900].

The maximum penalty for offences (1), (3) and (4) is 10 years imprisonment, with a jurisdictional limit in the Local Court of 2 years imprisonment or a fine of $2,200 or both. The maximum penalty for offence (2) is a fine of $1,100.

24There was no power to impose a section 9 bond in respect of offence (2). This is because section 9 of the Act only allows a section 9 bond to be imposed instead of a sentence of imprisonment. As the maximum penalty for offence (2) does not involve the possibility of a sentence of imprisonment, a section 9 bond is not available for that offence. Because the bond was imposed in error, there can be no breach of that bond. Under section 43 of the Act, the sentencing proceedings for offence (2) are reopened to correct that sentencing error.

25The facts concerning offences (1) to (4) are as follow. On 8 June 2010, when the offender was 20 years old, he went to Rockdale Railway Station just before midnight. He is depicted on closed circuit television footage briefly waiting for a train and then setting fire to a Railcorp security camera lens [offence (1)]. Shortly afterwards, the offender caught a train to Kogarah Railway Station. He initially sat on a bench for a brief time and then he was filmed by a security camera as he set fire to an object and dropped it under the bench [offence (2)]. On 18 July 2010, the offender attended the Bus Bay Interchange at Rockdale Railway Station, placed a piece of paper across the lens of a security camera and set fire to it with a lighter, so damaging the lens [offence (3)]. On 19 July 2010, the offender attended the Allawah Railway Station and entered a lift. He immediately punched a security camera and caused damage to the lens. He hit the camera again with his forearm and then set fire to the camera using a lighter, so further damaging the lens [offence (4)]. All of these actions were captured by security camera. The value of total damage caused by these offences is estimated to be $2,200.

26These offences generally are serious and require the emphasis of general deterrence in the sentencing exercise. The risk with such offences is that the fire might remain uncontrolled and cause extensive damage and injury. Although there was not great damage in this case, the offender has targeted the security cameras at railway stations on four days over some six weeks, potentially exposing others to danger and potentially allowing crimes to be committed undetected. These circumstances render the offences more serious.

27The offender initially pleaded not guilty to these offences on 19 October 2010, but following the order for a brief of evidence, he changed his plea on 30 October 2010 to pleas of guilty to all four offences.

28Prior to these offences, the offender had not committed similar offences.

29The expectation of being sentenced to a good behaviour bond is that the offender will be of good behaviour for the currency of the bond. The Court sentences offenders to a particular term of bond which is determined by reference to all of the relevant circumstances of the particular case, including the appropriate period by which the offender is to have the opportunity to rehabilitate and to demonstrate such rehabilitation. Sentencing for a breach of bond should reflect that, by breach of the trust placed in the offender by the Court, he has shown a lack of remorse and his prospects of rehabilitation are cast in doubt: R v Morris (unreported, 14 July 1995, NSWCCA); R v Doyle (1996) 84 A Crim R 287. In sentencing an offender for a breach of bond, the Court must take into account the period for which the offender complied with the bond and anything done by the offender in compliance with the bond: section 24(b) of the Act.

30In this case, it is argued on behalf of the offender that the Court should take no action in respect of the breaches. The reasons advanced were that the Probation Service had terminated supervision at the time of the breaches and that there was just over a month before the bonds expired. The Pre-Sentence Report dated 3 July 2012 confirms the offender responded positively to the supervision requirement that was terminated in June 2012, some 5 months prior to breach of the bonds.

31Whilst this is not a case involving a suspended sentence of imprisonment under section 12 of the Act and section 98(3) of the Act does not apply, the Court should still have regard to the gravity of the offender's failure to comply with the bond. His failure was constituted by the commission of a serious offence of reckless wounding. That offence was committed when there was about an eighth of the bond remaining. The seriousness of the breach renders the rejection of the Court's trust in the offender's rehabilitation unable to be excused. Instead, greater emphasis shifts to the need for specific deterrence. Accordingly, the bonds are revoked and the offender is to be resentenced for those offences that were the subject of the bonds. In resentencing the offender, the totality of criminality for these offences and the offence of reckless wounding must be reflected in the combination of sentences: R v Morris, above.

The subjective features

32Further to the offender's age, the Pre-Sentence Report reveals further subjective information. The offender currently lives with his parents and siblings. He had a stable upbringing and has a good relationship with his parents. The offender is unemployed and receives Centrelink benefits. He has a limited employment history, with his longest period of employment lasting three months. He has worked as a builder's labourer with his brother. He attained his school certificate at school. The offender reported a history of cannabis use, but claimed that he ceased his use just prior to the offence.

The sentences

33In sentencing the offender, the Court can only take into account the purposes of sentence listed in section 3A of the Act. The weight to be given to those purposes depends on the circumstances of each case. It has already been stated that the need for both general and specific deterrence for these offences looms large in this sentencing exercise.

34The Court must also sentence with regard to the maximum penalties providing the range of seriousness, rather than the jurisdictional caps prescribed by Parliament for each offence: R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115.

35Furthermore, the Court must determine a sentence that is appropriate for each offence in the context of the circumstances of the offence and the offender, but which also, when taken in combination, is reflective of the total criminality.

36For the section 9 bond matters, the bonds are revoked and the offender is resentenced. For offences (1), (3) and (4), the offences are of such a serious nature that only a full-time custodial sentence is appropriate and no other available sentence can adequately reflect the criminality involved.

37For offence (1) on 8 June 2010, the offender is sentenced to a term of four months imprisonment. A fixed term of less than six months is imposed as it takes into account the discount for pleading together and part compliance with the section 9 bond. It is backdated to have commenced on 6 May 2012 to reflect the period of time the offender was in custody awaiting the outcome of these matters. The offender is eligible for release in respect of that sentence on 5 September 2012.

38For offence (2) on 9 June 2010, as this offence carries a maximum penalty of a fine and the offender has just been sentenced to full-time custody, the matter is dealt with under section 10A of the Act. That is, he is convicted with no further punishment for that matter.

39For offence (3) on 18 July 2010, the offender is also sentenced to a term of four months imprisonment for the same reasons as for offence (1). It is to be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively upon offence (1) in order to reflect the separate offences but also to accommodate an overall appropriate totality in sentence. The sentence commenced on 6 June 2012 and the offender is eligible for release in respect of that sentence on 5 October 2012.

40For offence (4) on 19 July 2012, the offender is sentenced to a term of four months imprisonment for the same reasons as for offence (1). It is also to be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively upon offences (1) and (3). The sentence commenced on 6 July 2012 and the offender is eligible for release in respect of that sentence on 5 November 2012.

41For the offence of reckless wounding, only a full-time custodial sentence can adequately reflect the seriousness of the offence and the need for both specific and general deterrence. There is no other available sentence which can adequately address these concerns. With the 20 percent discount, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of twelve months with a total term of 24 months. The sentence is to be partly concurrent and partly consecutive with offences (1), (3) and (4). It commences on 6 August 2012, so causing the offender to be eligible for release in respect of his entire sentence on 5 August 2013, whereupon he is to submit to supervision on parole. Special circumstances justify the departure from the usual statutory ratio between the non-parole and parole periods. It is the offender's first sentence of imprisonment and the total sentence will need to afford a period of supervised parole following the offender's release from custody.

1McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Button J.

2PRICE J: I agree with Button J.

3BUTTON J:

Introduction
4On 14 October 2011 in the District Court at Parramatta, Judge Colefax SC convicted Leanne Tracey Church (""the applicant"") of one count of making an omission intending to pervert the course of justice. The offence was brought pursuant to s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900, and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years and no standard non-parole period. His Honour proceeded to sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a total term of 2 years 8 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months. Clearly enough, special circumstances were found that permitted a variation of the statutory ratio; if that had not occurred, the non-parole period would have been imprisonment for 2 years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court with regard to that sentence. 

Chronology

5On 5 April 2006, a dispute took place between the daughter of the applicant and another woman (""the victim"") at the Royal Hotel in Hill End in the Central West of New South Wales. Violence ensued, and the victim was left with swelling and bruising to much of her body. The applicant joined in the attack by her daughter on the victim. The applicant was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

6In the months after that, the applicant led people in Hill End to believe that she was suffering from cancer. That was not true. The pretence was not limited to words. It included shaving her head, wearing a bandana, and seeming to attend a clinic in order to receive treatment for the illness. 

7The applicant pleaded not guilty to the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. A hearing of that charge was conducted before Magistrate Hodgson in Mudgee Local Court. At the end of the hearing, on 19 October 2006, the Magistrate found the offence proven against the applicant. Turning to sentence, the Magistrate indicated that a gaol sentence was a distinct possibility, and ordered a pre-sentence report. The solicitor then appearing for the applicant immediately indicated that the applicant was suffering from cancer, and submitted that the matter could be dealt with there and then. The applicant, who was present, said and did nothing to contradict that assertion made by her solicitor about her medical condition. The Magistrate agreed to adopt that course and placed the applicant on a s 9 bond for 3 years. The Magistrate then said ""the only thing stopping you from going to gaol is because of your medical condition.""

8On 10 November 2006, a fundraiser was held by the people of Hill End in order to help the applicant pay her purported medical expenses. The applicant took receipt of about $200 that was raised.

9Subsequently, a suspicion arose that the applicant had permitted the Magistrate to be misled about her medical condition. 

10In May 2009, Police offered the applicant an opportunity to engage in an ERISP. She exercised her right to silence.

11On 6 April 2010, a Court Attendance Notice issued for the public justice offence under consideration. On 20 September 2010 the matter was committed for trial. On 30 May 2011 the trial was listed to commence. On 31 May 2011, the applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court. On 24 August 2011, when the proceedings on sentence were part-heard, her bail was revoked.

Objective features

12Contrary to part of the evidence of the applicant in the District Court, and what she had told a psychiatrist according to a report that was tendered on her behalf, the sentencing judge said in the remarks on sentence:

""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that [that is, the spreading of the story, the shaving of the head, and the regular wearing of the bandana] was not done as a result of some need for attention or to be loved, as is suggested in a psychologist's report (the psychologist's report being based exclusively on the assertions of the offender). I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was done in anticipation of a conviction.""

13With regard to the proceedings before the Magistrate, the sentencing Judge said:

""In assessing the true nature of this offender's criminality, it is appropriate I form an opinion as to what sentence ought to have been imposed on the offender by the Local Court. Having regard to the jurisdictional limit of that court and the objective seriousness of the offence, together with the offender's prior convictions and assuming, for present purposes, the most generous view of her subjective circumstances, a sentence of full time imprisonment of twelve months would have been the appropriate sentence.""

14The sentencing Judge found that, although the crime was one of omission, the inference was irresistible that the solicitor for the applicant had made the submission to the Magistrate about cancer on the basis of instructions from the applicant. 

Subjective features

15As noted above, the applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court when the trial was imminent. She received a discount for the utilitarian value of that plea of 10 per cent. 

16The sentencing Judge was not persuaded that the applicant was remorseful. 

17The criminal record of the applicant was not unblemished. She had been convicted of assault in 1995 and 2003. In March 2004, about two and a half years before the commission of the public justice offence under consideration, the applicant was convicted of passing two valueless cheques. In October 2010, many years after the commission of the offence, she received a suspended sentence of imprisonment for 8 months for the offence of obtaining money by deception, based upon her receipt of money that was derived from the fundraiser.

18Aged 42 when she stood for sentence in the District Court, the applicant had had an unhappy and unprivileged life. She had been bullied and teased as a child because of her appearance. She first became pregnant at the age of 14 or 15, and by the time she was aged 21 was the mother of 4 children. Due to a bitter family dispute she left Mount Druitt and moved to Hill End. Her husband became gravely ill, and by the time she pleaded guilty to the offence she was his primary carer. She herself had been a slow learner as a child and was an unsophisticated, simple woman. More recently, she developed clinical depression. That became so severe that she was admitted to a clinic for treatment for that condition in September 2010. 

19Her crimes attracted a degree of media attention. They were discussed on national television, and one can safely infer that the coverage was adverse to the applicant. 

Grounds of Appeal

20Four grounds of appeal have been notified. I shall deal with each of them in turn. 

Ground One: ""His Honour erred, when assessing the criminality of the s 319 offence, in forming an opinion as to the sentence which ought to have been imposed in the Local Court for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and in taking this matter into account on sentence.""

Submissions

21Counsel for the applicant submitted that it was an error of law for the sentencing Judge to embark upon a consideration of the hypothetical outcome in the Local Court if the public justice offence had not been committed. She also submitted that there was an error of fact in the determination of the sentencing Judge that the offence necessarily had the direct effect of evading a sentence of imprisonment for 12 months. Finally, counsel submitted that that exercise impermissibly conflated a sentence that ought to have been imposed for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm with the sentence that was actually imposed for the public justice offence.

22Counsel for the respondent submitted that it was correct for the sentencing Judge to undertake the exercise of seeking to determine the effect that the public justice offence had on the criminal justice system. He also submitted that the finding of fact was reasonably open. Finally, he submitted that there was nothing to suggest that the conflation alleged by counsel for the applicant had occurred.

Decision

23I consider that it was an important part of assessing the objective seriousness of the public justice offence for the sentencing Judge to determine the effect that the offence had on the proceedings before the Magistrate. By way of illustration, identical lies on oath (""I did not see my neighbour drive his car that day"") may be vastly different in seriousness, depending upon whether what was at stake was a fine for driving whilst disqualified, or many years in gaol for murder. I do not perceive error in the sentencing Judge undertaking that task.

24Nor do I think that the finding of fact was not reasonably open and is therefore liable to attract intervention of this Court. It is noteworthy that the sentencing Judge did not seek to determine what ""must"" or ""would"" have happened before the Magistrate. That would have been a different exercise, in light of the fact that the Magistrate did indeed order a pre-sentence report (and therefore cannot have been determined to sentence the applicant to full-time imprisonment there and then). I also accept that the statement ""the only thing stopping you from going to gaol is your medical condition"" could well have been more of a post-sentence admonition to good behaviour in the future rather than a considered reflection of what would definitely have happened but for the purported illness.

25Instead, the sentencing Judge referred to the sentence that ""ought to have been imposed"" and the sentence that, in his Honour's opinion ""would have been the appropriate sentence"". Those determinations were made after taking into account all of the evidence before the sentencing Judge, not just the material before the Magistrate. 

26I do not consider that the sentencing Judge was finding as a fact what would have happened. His Honour was determining what ought to have happened. I consider that the finding that the applicant ought to have been sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months, taking into account everything that the sentencing Judge knew by that stage, was reasonably open. 

27Finally, I do not accept that there was a conflation between the sentence that ought to have been imposed for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the sentence that was actually imposed for the public justice offence. It would have been an error for the sentencing Judge to seek to make up for the gaol sentence evaded in the Local Court with the gaol sentence imposed in the District Court. But there is no sign of that having happened.

28I would not uphold Ground One.

Ground Two: ""His Honour erred by failing to take into account the psychological effect of harassment, public opprobrium and humiliation.""

Submissions

29Counsel for the applicant submitted that the fact that the sentencing Judge made no explicit reference in the remarks on sentence to the media attention paid to the applicant demonstrates that it had not been taken into account. Counsel submitted that it is well established that such treatment can be taken into account as extra-curial punishment, and submitted that it should have been taken into account in the particular circumstances of this case.

30Counsel for the applicant further directed this Court to the decision in Kenny v R [2010] NSWCCA 6. In that case Howie J (with whom Basten JA and Johnson J agreed, Basten JA also delivering a separate judgment) said at [44] - [45]:

""[44] There is little doubt that a court can take into account the effects upon the offender that have occurred as a consequence of the commission of the offence. It can be a financial loss, for example the loss of employment or superannuation benefits. It can be a physical injury that has occurred to the offender, for example serious injury to the driver charged with causing death or injury to some other person as a result of the use of a motor vehicle. But it can go further and include other types of disadvantages resulting from the offending.

[45] In R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 the Court was concerned with a Crown appeal in respect of the digital penetration of the vagina of a 9 year old girl by a man aged 76. There was intense media coverage of the offence and the sentence imposed. The Court referred to some of the effects of the offence and its publicity as follows:

The evidence showed that, following the events of 4 January 1992, the respondent and his elderly wife were subjected to a campaign of abuse and harassment, involving threats of serious injury to person and property. It should be added that the Crown concedes that it is relevant to the outcome of this appeal that this campaign intensified following the announcement of Judge O'Reilly's decision. It reached such a level that the respondent was forced into a psychiatric clinic for treatment, and, according to the evidence, he was pursued even there. The respondent and his wife have had to leave their home, removing their belongings under cover of darkness, and they now live elsewhere under assumed names. Quite apart from the decision of this Court, the respondent and his wife have paid a high price for his wrongdoing.

This was one of the considerations taken into account by the Court in determining to dismiss the Crown appeal.""


31Counsel for the respondent submitted that the evidence was vague and imprecise, and in any event was not so extreme as to amount to extra-curial punishment that needed to be taken into account. He contrasted this case with cases where the careers of offenders had been destroyed, or their lives disastrously disrupted, such as in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561.

Evidentiary Background

32The evidentiary background is as follows. The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing Judge on 24 August 2011, and referred to the topic of media attention. On the same day the report of Dr Jones was tendered. That made reference to the topic as follows: 

""Ms Church went on to say that she had the media at her house and that she had 'been punished enough.' She accepted that some people were still angry that she had lied.""

A little later, the report of the psychiatrist also said:

""Ms Church told me that she did not go out of her house much any more and that she tries to avoid people she knows in shops because she is aware that people are judging her. She told me that she gets short of breath in these circumstances.""

33On 14 October 2011, very shortly before the sentencing Judge imposed sentence, the solicitor then appearing for the applicant said in submissions:

""Your Honour it is my submission that there has been some degree of extra-curial punishment. There has been extensive media coverage and the prisoner has given evidence about that and that maybe [sic] taken into account as extra-curial punishment in relation to the intense security which she has borne caused by her own actions.""

Decision

34I accept that the actions of the media can, in extreme cases, amount to extra-curial punishment. I also accept that the media interest in this matter was substantial, and having one's crimes exposed on national television could be gruelling and possibly deleterious to one's mental health. But here the applicant had undertaken an unusual and brazen crime that featured not only deception of a magistrate but also of a community. More generally, it is well-known that crimes committed by local citizens are given much more prominence in the media in small country towns than they are in metropolises like Sydney.

35In any event, I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to take the media attention and its effects on the applicant into account. The solicitor for the applicant made oral submissions about the media attention very shortly before his Honour delivered the remarks on sentence. It is most unlikely that his Honour had forgotten or disregarded what had been said by the solicitor of the applicant moments before. His Honour also referred to the report of Dr Jones when his Honour said in the remarks on sentence:

""A strong subjective case has been advanced on behalf of the offender through the pre-sentence report and the report of a psychiatrist, Dr Jones.""

36It is true that it is incumbent on a sentencing judge or magistrate to explain his or her findings and reasons in the remarks on sentence. But that does not mean that, wherever there is a failure to refer to any fact or topic in the remarks on sentence, one must infer that the matter was not taken into account, and error is thereby established. Remarks on sentence should not be unnecessarily lengthy, and on many occasions can be succinct, even in the District Court. Their purpose is to explain to the offender, the persons present in court, and the wider community, why the sentencing judge or magistrate is imposing the sentence that will immediately follow. Remarks on sentence should not have to recite laboriously all of the evidence given or tendered, the facts found, or the legal principles applied, for fear of committing an error by omission. The mere fact that a matter has not been mentioned in the remarks on sentence does not of itself found an appeal to this Court.

37I do not consider that Ground Two has been established.

Ground Three: ""His Honour erred by failing to take into account the applicant's depressive illness when considering the overall sentence.""

Submissions

38Counsel for the applicant submitted the only reference to the psychological condition of the applicant in the remarks on sentence was as follows: 

""There is objective material available to the effect that she does now have some psychological condition, which will make gaol more difficult for her than for other offenders. In those circumstances, I am prepared to find that special circumstances exist which justify the alteration of the ordinary ratio between the principle between the parole period and the non parole period.""

39She submitted that the mental condition of the applicant did not just relate to special circumstances, but also to the overall sentence.

40Counsel for the respondent replied by inviting attention to the passage extracted by me above, in which the sentencing Judge referred explicitly to the ""strong subjective case"" and immediately thereafter to the report of Dr Jones.

Decision

41As one would expect, the central focus of the psychiatric report was the mental state of the applicant, past, present and future. That in turn focussed very much on her depressive disorder, its causes, development, and treatment. I do not consider that it has been established that the sentencing Judge failed to take that aspect of the case into account.

42I would reject Ground Three.

Ground Four: ""His Honour erred in finding that specific deterrence was a significant consideration.""

Submissions

43Counsel for the applicant submitted that there had been a very substantial delay in the matter. The offence occurred in October 2006, and the applicant was sentenced in October 2011. During that time, apart from the offence of dishonesty that had been committed in November 2006, the applicant had been free of crime. Counsel for the applicant invited attention to the statement of the sentencing Judge in the remarks on sentence: 

""[n]otwithstanding this offender's lack of remorse, given her age and the totality of her background, I am satisfied that her prospects of rehabilitation (in the sense it is unlikely that she will re-offend) are good."" 

A little later, the sentencing Judge said:

""General deterrence, therefore, is a very important factor in the present case.

Having regard to the offender's history and notwithstanding my assessment of her prospects of rehabilitation, specific deterrence also remains a significant consideration.""

44Counsel for the applicant submitted that, in all of the circumstances, it was erroneous to find that specific deterrence remained a significant consideration in sentencing the applicant. 

45Counsel for the respondent submitted that, in truth, all the sentencing Judge was doing was referring to the well-known purposes of sentencing contained in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

Decision

46General deterrence has an obvious and important role to play in the punishment of public justice offences. I consider that, very often, specific deterrence will play an important role with regard to such offences as well.

47In this case, the applicant had committed offences of dishonesty, both before and after the public justice offence. Her evidence on oath had not been accepted by the Magistrate in 2006 and the sentencing Judge in 2011. The sentencing Judge also rejected what the applicant had told Dr Jones in November 2010. In all of the circumstances, I consider that it was open to the sentencing Judge to find that, even despite the absence of further offences over a number of years, and the unlikelihood of re-offending, specific deterrence had a role to play, especially with regard to offences which involve dishonesty or being untruthful, even by omission. 

48Speaking more generally, I do not consider that a finding that an offender is unlikely to re-offend thereby automatically precludes specific deterrence from playing a role in a sentence to be imposed. 

49I do not consider that Ground Four has been established.

Ground Five: ""The sentence is manifestly excessive.""

Submissions

50In support of this ground, counsel for the applicant drew attention to the starting point of imprisonment for 3 years, and submitted that, when one considers the seriousness of the offence, the powerful subjective case, the rehabilitation of the applicant, her mental condition, and the position with regard to her gravely ill husband, the sentence is manifestly excessive. She emphasised that, at the time she committed the offence, the applicant was not a person who played or had played a role in the administration of justice, such as a police officer (see R v Nguyen [2004] NSWCCA 332; (2004) 149 A Crim R 343) or a retired judge (see R v Einfeld [2010] NSWCCA 87; (2010) 200 A Crim R 1). 

51Counsel took the Court to statistics from the Judicial Information Research System (""JIRS"") to demonstrate the sentence is seemingly too severe in all of the circumstances, and does not fit comfortably in the range of sentences imposed at first instance. She also referred to a number of decisions of this Court with regard to offences against s 319 of the Crimes Act by way of a helpful table summarising thirteen appeals. She noted that the offence itself was in truth unsophisticated and very likely to be detected, as it ultimately was.

52Counsel for the respondent invited attention to well-known cases to the effect that what must be demonstrated in this Court is not merely a sentence that is stern or even severe, but rather a sentence that demonstrates a latent miscarriage of the sentencing discretion (House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499) or a sentence that is ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 257). He also submitted that this Court is one of error, and that it is not a matter of a judge of this Court merely determining whether he or she may have exercised the sentencing discretion differently from the sentencing Judge at first instance. 

Decision

53The JIRS statistics provide a useful overview of sentencing patterns at first instance. They can also sometimes indicate that a sentence sits inexplicably outside that pattern. But they are rarely determinative, and I do not find them to be so in this case.

54Nor do the other cases to which counsel invited attention persuade me that the sentence is manifestly excessive. They persuade me that the sentence imposed was stern, but not inappropriately so.

55Public justice offences constitute an attack on the administration of justice, and very often upon the criminal justice system. It is not uncommon for them to be more serious than offences against property, and even some offences against the person. The present case is an example of that phenomenon. I regard the crime that the applicant committed in the Local Court at Mudgee as much more serious than the crime she committed in the Royal Hotel in Hill End. 

56Furthermore, it is not as if, on the morning of Court, the applicant, paralysed with fear of being incarcerated, spontaneously told a desperate lie to her solicitor. On the contrary, the sentencing Judge was satisfied that the deception extended over many weeks, and was, during that time, engaged in with an eye to avoiding gaol by perverting the course of justice.

57I accept that the ruse was unsophisticated and very unlikely to be ultimately successful, in the sense of the applicant escaping punishment permanently. I also accept that the life of the applicant has been marred by unhappiness, misfortune, and illness, both her own and others. However, it seems to me that it has not been established that a sentence of imprisonment for a total term of 2 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months is so far beyond the available discretion of the sentencing Judge as to constitute error. Accordingly, I do not consider that Ground Five has been established.

Orders

58In short, I would not uphold any ground of appeal against sentence. The orders that I propose are:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

		10 July 2012",2012-07-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759625,RAJAGOPAL Hariharan v R [2012] NSWCCA 148,"Judgment

1MCCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Rothman J.

2ROTHMAN J: The applicant, Hariharan Rajagopal, seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him by the District Court on 20 September 2010 for four counts of using a false instrument with intent, contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime, contrary s 193B(3) of the Crimes Act. The applicant also seeks an extension of time.

3The maximum sentence for each offence with which the applicant was charged is 10 years' imprisonment. Further, a Form 1, notifying eight further counts of using a false instrument with intent, was taken into account in dealing with the first count.

4The applicant was sentenced as follows:

Counts 2, 3 and 4: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 20 months commencing 27 November 2009 and expiring 26 July 2011.

Count 5: Imprisonment for a fixed term of two years commencing 27 November 2009 and expiring 26 November 2011.

Count 1: Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years and four months commencing 27 May 2010 and concluding 26 September 2012, with an additional term of 12 months, concluding 26 September 2013. 

5The overall sentence imposed upon the applicant was a non-parole period (including fixed term imprisonment) of 2 years and 10 months, commencing 27 November 2009 and concluding 26 September 2012, with a remainder of term of a further 12 months concluding 26 September 2013.

6On 29 February 2012, at the conclusion of the hearing of the application for leave and appeal, the Court issued the following orders:

""1.Extend the time to appeal.

2.Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal allowed.

3. Sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed. 

Applicant is resentenced:

4.In relation to counts 2 to 4 to a period of imprisonment for a fixed term of 10 months commencing 27 November 2009 and expiring 26 September 2010.

5.In relation to count 5 period of imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing 27 November 2009 and expiring 26 May 2011.

6.In relation to count 1 and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 March 2010 and expiring on 29 February 2012 with a total term of 2 years 9 months to expire on 31 December 2012.

7.Pursuant to s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the court directs that the applicant be released to parole on 1 March 2012.""

These are my reasons for joining in those orders.

Facts

7An agreed statement of facts was available at the sentence hearing which the sentencing judge summarised and relied upon. The sentencing judge also had the benefit of a recorded interview with the applicant and the applicant gave evidence at the hearing. The agreed facts can be summarised briefly. 

8A covert physical surveillance by Strike Force Wigg (part of the Fraud Squad) observed the applicant trying to withdraw funds from two ATMs at a shopping centre at Seven Hills on Thursday, 26 November 2009. 

9Police located a blank plastic card sticking out of the slot of the second ATM. Attached to this card were small pieces of paper containing details such as bank names, account types and PINs. These two ATM incidents constitute the first offence and one of the Form 1 offences.

10On 27 November 2009, a member of the public contacted the police after observing the applicant engaging in suspicious behaviour in relation to a Commonwealth Bank ATM in Penrith. Police attended and arrested the applicant. 

11The police found the applicant was in possession of 14 fraudulent blank cards with small pieces of paper containing written information attached to them, as well as cash and a receipt corresponding to the amount of cash that had been withdrawn.

12$7,920 in cash was located in the applicant's wallet on his arrest. During a search of the applicant's premises, police located a further amount of $1,750. The applicant told police that a person known as ""Amchor"" had given him $1,750 as an advance payment for engaging in the fraudulent activity. The total amount of $9,670 formed the basis of count 5, namely, recklessly dealing with proceeds of crime.

13The applicant had no previous criminal history, either in Australia or elsewhere. He was tempted into criminal activity by the financial rewards and the financial difficulties under which he was suffering at the time. His formative years included a supportive family environment during the turbulent period in Sri Lanka where, as a Tamil, the applicant witnessed a violent incident and had been subject to significant persecution.

14The applicant is currently in a relationship, which had, at the time of the sentencing hearing, existed for approximately 18 months, including the time spent in prison, during which his partner had visited him. The applicant has been the subject of psychological treatment and was assessed as unable and unfit for employment by the Australian Red Cross. Psychological reports were tendered and were in evidence before the sentencing judge, and this Court. 

Grounds of appeal

15The applicant appeals on four grounds:

(i)The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending having regard to the actual conduct of the applicant, the amount involved and the period of offending;

(ii)The sentencing judge erred in failing to give appropriate effect to the availability of summary disposal having found it was a viable option;

(iii)The sentencing judge erred in only applying the effect of a finding of special circumstances to the sentence for Count 1;

(iv)The sentences imposed are manifestly excessive.

Extension of time

16The applicant filed an application for an extension of time to allow for the filing of a notice of appeal on 14 October 2011. The period for the filing of such a document expired on 26 March 2011.

17The Crown opposes the extension of time, but is unable to point to any prejudice associated with the delay. An extension of time ought not be taken as a formality, but in the current circumstances, given the absence of any prejudice to which the Crown can point, an extension should be granted to allow the filing of a notice of appeal on 14 October 2011.

Submissions of the parties

18Ultimately, at the hearing of the appeal, the applicant used the first three grounds of appeal as particulars of the manifest excess for which he contended. Statistics were utilised to show the range of sentences that had been imposed for offences under s 300(1) and s 300(2) of the Crimes Act.

19The applicant submitted that the sentences imposed, and the overall sentence imposed, were at the very upper end of the range of sentences imposed for such offences, in circumstances where the objective gravity of the offences were well below the range of offending disclosed in those statistics.

20The Crown submitted that statistics were unhelpful and that each case should be decided upon its merits. Further, the Crown submitted that even if statistics were to be considered, the sentences fell within the proper range of sentences available for the relevant offences.


Consideration

21The approach of the applicant, in treating the other grounds of appeal as particulars of the ground on manifest excess, creates some difficulties. The mere fact that the sentences imposed may be outside the range of sentences imposed in similar cases will not of itself permit intervention by this Court: Wong v R (2001) 207 CLR 584. 

22An appeal court that is asked to deal with the exercise of discretion, such as sentencing, is required to identify error. Absent error of a kind that is one of the well-known bases for interference with an exercise of discretion, an appeal court is unable to intervene. Having said that, error can be identifiable or latent error: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499.

23Latent error arises when the outcome is such that the appeal court is satisfied that there has been a failure to apply principle or a misapplication of principle (or one of the other errors), even though the appeal court is unable to identify the error.

24Further, as to the use of tables and statistics, great care must be taken in relying on statistics or tables of past sentences imposed. Statistics and tables can be a useful guide to the range of sentences that have been imposed for offences. However, the sentencing judge must impose a sentence by applying sentencing principles to the facts and circumstances before the court; not by the mechanical application of statistics or averages: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520.

25In this case, there may be good reason for dealing with the grounds of appeal in the manner suggested by the applicant. Each of the other grounds of appeal, or allegations of error, seeks to persuade the Court that the sentencing judge was involved in error. Yet, there is an absence of express error in the sentencing judge's statement or application of principle.

26The objective gravity of the offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced was at the lower end of the range. It seems that, in taking into account, as the sentencing judge was required to do, the conduct of the applicant was part of a planned, organised and ongoing criminal enterprise, the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective gravity of the offence has been infected to an impermissible extent by the overall criminal activity, instead of assessing the actual role played by the applicant in that activity.

27Whatever be the reason, I accept that the sentence imposed is outside the range available for the circumstances of the offence and the offender and it is for that reason that I joined in the orders made by the Court on 29 February 2012.

28DAVIES J: I agree with Rothman J.

29After the reasons of the Court were published, the Court's attention was drawn to an error with respect to the expiration date of the total term for count 1 in the Orders of the Court made on 29 February 2012. This was a result of a simple calculation error. The balance of term for count 1 should, of course, expire on 30 November 2012, not 31 December 2012. Accordingly, the Order made on 29 February 2012 with respect to count 1 is vacated. Order 6 will now read:

""In relation to count 1 and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 March 2010 and expiring on 29 February 2012 with a total term of 2 years 9 months to expire on 30 November 2012."" (emphasis added).

2759629,BT v R [2012] NSWCCA 128,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Adamson J.
2JOHNSON J:  I agree with Adamson J.
3ADAMSON J:  On 18 June 2010, the applicant (BT) was sentenced after plea of guilty to the following three counts:
(1)Aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of five years;
(2)Aggravated sexual intercourse inflicting actual bodily harm, contrary to s 61JA of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of fifteen years;
(3)Sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of seven years.
4The standard non-parole periods did not apply to the applicant as he was under the age of 18 years at the time of the offences:  s 54D(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; 201 A Crim R 379 at 388 [36].
5In respect of count 3 he was sentenced to a term of 5 ½ years, with a three-year non-parole period to date from 3 March 2009. In respect of count 1 he was sentenced to a term of 2 ½ years with a one-year non-parole period to date from 3 March 2011. In respect of count 2, he was sentenced to a term of eight years with a three-year non-parole period. The total term for all three offences is ten years with a five-year non-parole period, with the applicant eligible to apply for release to parole on 2 March 2014.
6Counts 1 and 2 occurred within the same period on the evening of 7 - 8 March 2009. Count 3 occurred in a separate incident on the following evening, 8 March 2009.
7The applicant seeks leave to appeal on two grounds: first, that the sentence imposed on count 2 is manifestly excessive; and secondly, that the total effective sentence is excessive.
Facts
The circumstances of the offences
8The following narrative is derived from the statement of agreed facts.
9On 6 March 2009 the victim was entered into the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice (the Department) for breach of an Apprehended Violence Order at the Frank Baxter Correctional Centre at Kariong (Baxter), a juvenile detention facility. He was then 16 years and 9 months old.
10BT and the co-accused were at Baxter for offences of violence and property offences.
11On Saturday 7 March 2009, BT, the co-accused and the victim were required to sleep on mattresses on the floor of an interview room because of the lack of suitable accommodation at Baxter. There was a CCTV camera in the interview room. 
12BT and the co-accused then used duress to require the victim to masturbate them and used brute force and threats of violence to make him perform fellatio on each of them. These assaults continued over almost three hours between about 11.30 pm on 7 March 2009 and 2.20 am on 8 March 2009. Between the sexual assaults, both BT and the co-accused took turns to punch the victim. At one stage BT punched the victim in the left eye with a closed fist.
13The following evening, 8 March 2009, BT, the co-accused and the victim were again allocated the same interview room in which to sleep. At about 8.30 pm, when the victim was in bed, BT used force to roll the victim over and raped him. When the victim asked him to stop, BT threatened to hit him if he screamed.
14On 9 March 2009, the victim reported the offences and told police that he was fearful that he would suffer further assault at the hands of BT and the co-accused.
The applicant's subjective circumstances
15The applicant was born on 3 March 1993 and had just turned 16 at the time of the offences. The Department of Community Services had been involved in the applicant's care since he was six. On 16 December 2003, when the applicant was ten, he and his brother were taken to the police station by their mother who told police that she could no longer care for them. They were found to exhibit signs of neglect and were made subject to the Minister's responsibility until they were 18. In April 2007 the applicant was placed with the Allambie Youth Services Residential Placement Service where he remained until he was taken into custody by the Department in early 2009. He completed Year 9 but not Year 10. When he was taken into custody in early 2009 he had a criminal record that included offences of violence but no sexual offences.
Grounds for leave to appeal
Ground 1: sentence for count 2 manifestly excessive
16The challenge to the sentence for count 2 was confined to the length of the parole period, the non-parole period of three years being accepted to be open to the sentencing judge. The applicant submitted that a term of eight years for count 2 was manifestly excessive. 
17Ground 1 focuses entirely upon the sentence imposed on count 2. A narrow focus on the sentence imposed on one of several counts may introduce an element of artificiality given that the sentencing judge has had regard to principles concerning concurrency, accumulation and totality in passing sentences for all offences: cf R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 320 [82].
18I consider that the sentence of eight years on count 2 was not unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. The relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term on that count is to be understood by reference to the total effective sentence imposed for all three offences, so that the non-parole period itself is not manifestly excessive.
19As part of his challenge to the sentence for count 2 the applicant contended that the sentencing judge had not adequately taken into account the effect of the applicant's mental illness. This contention was not expressed in the ground of appeal, but it was developed in the course of oral argument before this Court, purportedly in support of ground 1.
20The submissions made in this Court were markedly different to those advanced before the sentencing judge. This Court has expressed concern about this approach recently in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 (Zreika) at [79] - [81]. As was said in Zreika, this court is a court of error. In sentencing appeals the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment. An appeal to this Court is not an opportunity to recast the case presented to the sentencing judge. I propose nevertheless to consider the submissions to determine whether error has been demonstrated.
21The applicant relied on R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 (Hemsley) at [33] - [36], where Sperling J, with whom Grove and Dowd JJ agreed, said that ways in which mental illness may be relevant to sentencing included the following:
(1) Where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced and there may not be the same need for denunciation and punishment;
(2) Mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration; and
(3) Mental illness may have the effect that a custodial sentence weighs more heavily on the offender; 
22The first factor was expressly eschewed by the applicant's counsel in the sentence hearing in the following terms:
""there is no evidence of any causal connection between his mental health problems and the offence""
23This concession was consistent with the history the applicant is recorded to have given to Justice Health, the report of which records that BT ""denied that any psychotic symptoms were particularly related to the index offence"". 
24Notwithstanding the concession made before the sentencing judge, the applicant contended in this Court that the point was still open, having regard to the following passage in the Justice Health report dated 17 June 2010:
""[BT] told Dr Kasinathan on arrival to the Bronte Unit, that his psychotic symptoms were not related to the index offences. [BT] continued to deny that psychotic symptoms were directly over [sic] to his alleged commission of the index offences. However, on 26 November 2009, [BT] told Dr Kasinathan that the voices may have said 'bend him [the victim] over.' This was more consistent with a commentary nature of his voices, rather than any commanding nature of the psychotic symptoms in relation to the alleged offences.""
25The offences were committed in March 2009. The applicant was admitted to the Bronte Unit at the Forensic Hospital on 1 September 2009. He maintained his denial of any causal link between his offending behaviour and his mental condition until 26 November 2009. That the applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing affects the weight to be given to the history recorded in the report: R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 (Wright) at 52, per Hunt CJ at CL. There was no investigation of the possible reasons for the inconsistency between what the applicant told Dr Kasinathan prior to 26 November 2009 and what he said on that day. Such investigation would have been irrelevant having regard to the concession and difficult, if not impossible, to undertake, in any event, since the applicant did not give evidence. 
26In Zreika, this Court said, at [81]:
""The court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made.""
27In light of the concession and the circumstance that the applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge erred in any respect in taking into account mental illness. 
28As to the second factor, the applicant contended that the applicant's mental illness made him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence.
29It is an accepted principle of sentencing that general deterrence may be given less weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others: Hemsley; Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 124. However, if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation need not be great: Wright. It is important to ensure that the subjective features of the offender do not outweigh the significance properly to be attached to the objective features of the case: Wright at 55, per Gleeson CJ.
30In the Remarks on Sentence (ROS), the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant may not have been fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his ""level of immaturity and by reason of the mental health issue set out within the forensic psychiatrist's report and the Juvenile Justice background report"".
31After referring to the material tendered, including psychiatric evidence, the sentencing judge said:
""That material sets out what in many ways can only be described as a tragic background. The lack of role models, the physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect to which he was subject over many years has been exacerbated by his abuse of illicit substances and alcohol and that in turn has exacerbated what is clearly a latent serious mental health issue noting Dr Goh's diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. It is a tragic background and close examination of it, at least in some way, makes explicable this otherwise inexplicable conduct of 7 and 8 March 2009.""
32In my view, the ROS and, in particular, the passage set out above, indicate that the sentencing judge gave the applicant's mental condition such weight as was appropriate.
33As to the third factor, the applicant's submissions can be dealt with shortly. The sentencing judge found special circumstances and can be taken to have accepted that time in custody would weigh more heavily on the applicant. There is no challenge to the finding of special circumstances or the appropriateness of the non-parole period. In these circumstances I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge erred in taking into account the third factor. 
Ground 2: overall sentence manifestly excessive
34In addition to relying on the matters in support of ground 1, the applicant submitted that the commencement date for the sentence on count 2 should not have been two years after the commencement date for the sentence imposed on count 3.
35The sentencing judge dealt expressly with the issue of totality in the following passage in the ROS:
""...In the Court's view the sentences to be imposed for count 1 and count 2 can be concurrent in that the sentence on count 2 can reflect the total criminality of that incident. However, in relation to count 3, it occurred on a different day, involved a different type of sexual intercourse and in my view requires some cumulation...the Court will comply with the decision of the High Court in Pearce by imposing discrete sentences to reflect the criminality of each sentence. The concurrence between 1 and 2 and the partial cumulation with count 3 will result in an effective total sentence that reflects the effective total criminality.
The Court notes that the offender had been in custody for a short period of time prior to the commission of this offence and in fact served the balance of a control order until 2 April 2009. The Court notes that according to the record, it was a two-month control order, commencing on 3 February 2009 expiring on 2 April. The Court proposes to back date the first sentence to 3 March, that is to take into account the time already served and also by way of partial concurrence with that two-month control order. It will also have the effect and meaning that the non-parole period will expire the day before the offender turns twenty-one.""
36Count 3 was committed on the evening following the commission of counts 1 and 2. Not to partially accumulate count 3 with the concurrent sentences for counts 1 and 2 would, in my view, have been erroneous. Indeed, the applicant conceded in this Court that some partial accumulation up to one year would have been open to the sentencing judge. As Simpson J said in R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38]:
""...In this context the Crown appropriately reminded the Court of the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The first purpose so specified is ensuring adequate punishment for crime; others here relevant include crime prevention by deterrence, denunciation, making an offender accountable, and recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community. To fail to accumulate, at least partially, may well be seen as a failure to acknowledge the harm done to those individual victims.""
37I do not regard the two years' accumulation to be excessive in circumstances where count 3 was committed on a subsequent evening and involved fresh and, in relation to this victim, unprecedented acts of sexual violence and violation. I consider the degree of accumulation was within the discretion of the sentencing judge and appropriate having regard to the principles of proportionality and totality.
Additional remarks
38In the ROS, the sentencing judge referred to the situation in which BT, the co-accused and the offender found themselves in the following terms:
""Now the victim was, in my view, vulnerable because of his incarceration and the fact that he was effectively forced to be in that particular room with those two individuals. The Court accepts that the criminality was not planned, but rather appears to have been a response to a given situation.""
39Neither BT nor the co-accused can be absolved of criminal responsibility by reason of the circumstance that the Department housed them in such a way as to provide them with the opportunity to commit the index offences. 
40Nonetheless authorities which control detention centres for juveniles have particular obligations to safeguard the welfare of such juveniles.
41At the time of these offences, s 4 of the Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987 provided as follows:
""4 Objects of Act
(1) The objects of this Act are to ensure that:
(a) persons on remand or subject to control take their places in the community as soon as possible as persons who will observe the law,
(b) in the administration of this Act, sufficient resources are available to enable the object referred to in paragraph (a) to be achieved, and
(c) satisfactory relationships are preserved or developed between persons on remand or subject to control and their families.
(2) In the administration of this Act:
(a) the welfare and interests of persons on remand or subject to control shall be given paramount consideration, and
(b) it shall be recognised that the punishment for an offence imposed by a court is the only punishment for that offence.""
42The welfare and interests of the victim in particular do not appear to have been given sufficient, let alone, paramount, consideration. Overcrowding in such centres may, as the events of the instant case illustrate, lead to conduct that is inimical both to the interests of justice and to the welfare of the inmates of such Centres.
Orders
43I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

		10 July 2012",2012-07-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759633,BG v R [2012] NSWCCA 139,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Adamson J.
2McDOUGALL J: I agree with Adamson J.
3ADAMSON J: The applicant (BG) was convicted of three counts of sexual offences against his daughter (K), contrary to the Crimes Act 1900: two counts of aggravated indecent assault against a child under the age of 10 years, (s 61M(2)) and one count of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years (s 66A) following a trial before the District Court (Payne DCJ and a jury of 11). BG was sentenced to an aggregate non-parole period of six years, with an additional term of three years.
4BG seeks leave to appeal against his conviction on two grounds: first, that the verdicts should be set aside on the ground that they are unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence; and secondly, that there was a miscarriage of justice because the trial judge erroneously discharged a juror and allowed the trial to continue with 11 jurors.
Ground 1: unreasonable verdict
5The first ground of appeal requires this Court to ask itself whether it considers that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that BG was guilty: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 (M) at [7]. The joint judgment in M went on to say, at [24]:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
6The task is, accordingly, to independently assess the whole of the evidence, both as to sufficiency and quality.
The evidence
7K's parents began their relationship in Scone in 1994. BG subsequently moved to Mackay with K's mother and her four children. K, her mother's fifth child, was born in Mackay on 6 April 1995. In about 1997, the relationship between K's parents deteriorated and BG moved back to the Scone area. K remained with her mother and half-siblings in Mackay.
8In early 2002, K's mother had begun another relationship. K told her mother that she wanted to live with BG in Scone. In February 2002, K, at the age of 6, flew to Brisbane. On her arrival, BG met her and drove her to Scone, where he was then living with his mother. His sister, Julie, lived nearby in Aberdeen. Subsequently BG formed a relationship with a woman, Melissa, who had a son who was about three or four. K got on well with Melissa.
9BG and Melissa then set up a household together, with the two children, K and Melissa's son, in Barton Street, Scone. In February 2002, K was enrolled at the local school.
10At some time in 2002, BG took Melissa, K and Melissa's son to visit Julie. This was the first Julie knew that her brother had returned to the area. 
11From the time of the first visit, K visited Julie's about once a month to play with her cousins, three girls, one of whom was close in age to K. Sometimes K would stay overnight and on one occasion, in the summer holidays at the end of 2002, K went to Port Macquarie on a holiday with Julie's family. When K was at Julie's place, K would often telephone her mother because Julie allowed her to talk as long as she liked. By contrast, when she tried to telephone from BG's house, he would object to the conversations.
12Just before Christmas 2002, BG, Melissa and the two children moved to a single storey brick veneer house in Satur Road, Scone.
13K gave evidence that in about the first half of 2003, she found a note in her father's handwriting on the kitchen table ""in the blue house"" in which he said that he wanted to hurt himself. She showed the note, which she interpreted as a suicide note, to Melissa.
14K gave evidence that at some time in June or July 2003, BG sexually assaulted her. K said that from the time her father came home from work on the relevant day, he started drinking beer with a male friend, who had come over to watch a football match on television with him. According to K, BG was drinking because he was both happy and excited by what he was watching.
15K put herself to bed at about 9 pm. She had been to school that day. From her bedroom she could hear Melissa and BG arguing about BG's drinking. She heard Melissa ask him to turn down the television. She also heard Melissa ask BG's friend to leave. K's evidence was that BG and Melissa often argued about his drinking and, on occasions, Melissa would leave the house because of it, taking her son with her.
16On this occasion Melissa took her son with her in her car and drove away. BG's friend also left. 
17K's evidence was that BG then came into K's bedroom and started rubbing her arms. He smelled of beer. K recalled him wearing jeans and a Broncos football shirt. When he tried to unbutton her pyjama top, she resisted by hitting and kicking him. BG became angry. He pushed down the blankets that were covering her body. He undid some of the buttons on her pyjama top and started touching her breasts. He then pulled down her pyjama boxer shorts, unzipped his trousers and rubbed his penis against her. K hit BG even harder. BG then turned her over so that she lay on her stomach and inserted his finger into her vagina. K was crying because it hurt. She tried to kick him but he held her legs down. He rubbed his penis against her vagina. 
18K then heard a car horn outside. She recognised the car as Melissa's. BG pulled his pants up and said to her, ""Don't tell anyone."" He then left the room and shut the door. K lay on her bed crying. She felt ""disgusting"". She realised at the time that what had happened was wrong.
19When K saw Melissa the following morning, she did not tell her what occurred because she was too scared. 
20The following weekend, K went to her aunt Julie's place. Julie noticed that K was a lot quieter than usual and also withdrawn. K volunteered that she missed her mother, whom she had not seen since she went to Scone in February 2002, and that she wanted to go home to live with her. K asked Julie to ring her mother to ask if she could return to Queensland to live with her. K was concerned that her mother's boyfriend, Denny, would not want her to come and live with them.
21Julie telephoned K's mother to pass on K's request. Because Julie was concerned about K, she offered to have K continue to stay with her for a while rather than return to live with BG if it was difficult for K's mother to have her back at that time. K's mother agreed to have K back and BG agreed that she could return to Mackay. 
22While K was staying with Julie at that time, she was taken to Australia's Wonderland with Julie's family.
23Julie went to BG's house to collect K's clothes from the house at Satur Road and helped pack them up for her. She described the house as a single storey brick veneer house.
24On about 23 July 2003, BG and a male friend drove K back home to Mackay. According to K, ""there was not enough money for a plane"". When they arrived, BG had a short conversation with K's mother, to which K was not privy, and then left. K's mother corroborated K's evidence that BG and a male friend had delivered K.
25Although K described herself as getting on well with her mother she did not tell her mother what had happened because: 
""I did not want her to feel disgusted in me or anything like that.""
26K started school in Dysart, Queensland, on 4 August 2003.
27K said that she saw her father twice between 2003 and 2008; on each occasion he had a different woman with him. On one of those occasions, when K was still in primary school, K stayed with BG and BG's then girlfriend in a hotel room. K said that she did not want to go but her mother, who then did not know about the incident, persuaded her to go with them. At about that time K told her mother that she did not want to go on holiday with BG again.
28K's mother gave evidence that she made K see BG in April 2007, although she was unwilling.
29In early 2008, K's mother decided to finalise a property settlement with BG. There was correspondence between them. On 13 March 2008, BG wrote to K's mother, who showed K the letter. When K learned that her father wanted a property settlement she became concerned that he might apply for custody of her. K's mother's evidence was:
""I just showed her that and yeah, it didn't say anything about for custody or that but all she said she didn't want to go with him.""
30In mid 2008, K's mother applied for a divorce but K did not learn of it until later.
31At some time in October 1988, there was a discussion in K's class at school about suicide. K mentioned the note which her father had written and which she had found on the kitchen table some years earlier when she was living with him in Scone.
32By 2008, K, who ""kept feeling sick about it"", felt that she needed to talk to someone about what her father had done to her in mid-2003. In about October 2008, she decided to tell her best friend, Meg, because she ""thought she could trust"" her and they were ""really close"". She told Meg that when she was young her father had sexually abused her. She did not give Meg any details about what had occurred. K impressed on Meg the need to keep this in strict confidence and told her that it was ""very private and personal"".  Meg gave evidence that when K confided in her K ""had tears in her eyes"", ""was kind of shaking a lot"", ""very distraught"" and ""it was very hard for her to tell me"".
33Other children in the school became aware that something secret had been imparted and put ""pressure"" on Meg to tell them what K had told her. Finally, Meg succumbed. K was very upset at what she saw as Meg's breach of confidence.
34A teacher at K's school collected those children who had been told by Meg, Meg herself and K, and spoke to them about the matter. The school then referred the matter to the police.
35K's mother was first informed of the allegations in November 2008.  As a result she applied for formal custody of K. Although K was then living just with her mother, the relationship with Denny having ended, she did not tell, and had not at the date of trial, told her mother of the details of what had happened. Nor did she want her mother to be present at either of the interviews conducted by the police referred to below.
36The police first interviewed K on 21 November 2008. This was the first time she had disclosed to anyone the details of what had happened in mid-2003. Police interviewed K again on 20 October 2009.
The location of the house where the incident occurred
37In her first record of interview, K recalled that when the relevant conduct occurred she was living in a ""blue house"" which she described as being two storeys. The living area was on the first storey and below that there was a concrete slab. She said that it was the third house they lived in when she was in Scone with BG. She described the first house as being a one-storey brick house opposite a park. She described the second house as being a one-storey house with a front fence and a pool out the back. She described the third house as a two-storey blue house with a shed and a verandah out the back.
38In her second record of interview, K was asked to draw a plan of the house where the incident occurred. The floor plan she drew is broadly consistent with the layout of the house at Satur Road, of which a DVD was taken. When K was shown the DVD where BG had been living at the time K returned to Mackay, K denied that the incident occurred at that house.
39Senior Constable Way gave evidence of police investigations which established that BG had lived in two houses in Scone for the period K was living with him: first, Barton Street and later Satur Road. As referred to above, Julie gave evidence that she collected K's clothes from the house at Satur Road in July 2003, just before K returned to Mackay. Neither of the two houses was two storeyed and neither was blue.
The accused's challenge to K's evidence and the accused's evidence in the trial
40Apart from putting that the incident had not happened, and that K had fabricated the allegations in order to resist any application BG might make for custody of her, the challenges to K's evidence were confined to matters of detail extraneous to the incident itself.
41For example, it was put to K that she had a doona with a Barbie doll on it. This was presumably to impugn her recollection that there were blankets on her bed on the relevant night. Julie recalled that K had had a doona with a Barbie doll on it, but K could not recall it.
42It was also put to K that her father did not own a Broncos shirt, but K was insistent that he did. When it was put to her that her father supported the Eels in the NRL, K said ""I don't know"" and added, ""It was his choice"". BG gave evidence that he supported the Eels and that he never had a Broncos shirt. He was not however, asked whether he had an Eels shirt.
43It was put to K that BG and Melissa and Melissa's son had driven her back to Mackay in July 2003, but K said that Melissa did not come and that the only other person in the vehicle was a male friend of BG's. BG gave evidence to support what was put to K in cross-examination. K's mother corroborated K.
44BG's counsel put to K that BG had visited her three times, rather than two, in the period between her return to Mackay in July 2003 and 2008. K could only recall two. BG gave evidence that K was ""excited"" to see him in 2003.
45K was extensively cross-examined about the houses she had lived in with BG at Scone. She could remember three; it was put that there were two. She recalled there being two dogs but could not recall one dying.
46BG's counsel also put to K in cross-examination that BG had never taken her to Julie's place but K said that she had visited there quite frequently. Julie corroborated K's evidence. In his own evidence, BG said that he could not recall K spending time at Julie's house but conceded that it may have happened.
47BG gave evidence that K had left in July 2003 because Melissa, who was then pregnant, had given him an ultimatum to choose between her and K. He said he had given K the choice and that she had chosen to return to her mother. When cross-examined, BG could not recall when Melissa's child was born because he had only seen him once. He admitted that he and Melissa had separated in August 2003.
48BG gave evidence that he never drank in the period that K was living with him because he was on call as a truck driver. He denied that he and Melissa had ever fought.
49Although BG denied writing a suicide note, when it was put to him that he had written a note that said that he would hurt himself, his first response was:
""It couldn't have [occurred], because she said it was in a big blue house, a two storey house and we didn't live in a two storey house, so the note mustn't have been there at all.""
Assessment of the evidence as a whole
50BG's case at trial was that K returned to Queensland to live with her mother in mid-2003 because of an ultimatum given to him by Melissa, who was then pregnant and that K had fabricated the allegations against him because she did not want to live with him in the event that he applied for custody.
51The principal difficulty with this hypothesis is that K did not disclose what had happened either generally or in detail to her mother. Indeed, the only person to whom K chose to reveal what happened was Meg, her best friend. The revelation was obviously distressing to K, who made it in strictest secrecy because she wanted to unburden herself and thought she could trust Meg to tell no one. If K had had her way, the disclosure she made to Meg would never have come to light and could, accordingly, never have affected whether she would have to live with her father again. 
52BG relied on the circumstance that the disclosure was made over five years after the event at a time when K harboured what may have been an unfounded fear that there might be an issue between her parents as to her custody. It is difficult to see how this assists BG's defence. That K was fearful of having to reside with her father may explain why the incident in 2003 was so much on her mind in 2008 that she felt that she had to tell someone. But it tells in favour of K's credibility that she chose a source whom she believed, mistakenly, would keep her secret safe.
53Although K gave evidence that she was fearful of having to reside with her father, there is no positive evidence that it played any part in her need to disclose the incident to Meg. Furthermore, although she did not want to be with her father, she had no particular reason to believe that he would seek custody of her. He had not indicated that he would in the letter he sent to her mother in March 2008, which her mother showed her. K's experience was that her parents abided by her wishes as to where she would live. In 2002, when she told her mother that she wanted to live with her father, they agreed. In 2003, when she told her mother that she wanted to return, her mother was prepared to take her back and BG delivered K to her mother's home.
54In my view the delay in disclosure can be readily explained by reference to K's shame about what had happened and her fear that others would find her ""disgusting"" if they knew. Although the incident was not reported at the time, its occurrence is, in my view, corroborated by K's desire to leave BG's house and take refuge with Julie until she could move back home to her mother. Julie's description of K's altered countenance and K's refusal to disclose the reason for it are consistent with the nature of the incident. If K had wanted to return to live with her mother because of Melissa's ultimatum to BG, it is difficult to see why she would have felt it necessary to conceal the reason for her departure to Julie, particularly as she was fond of her aunt and was a regular visitor to her house.
55It is well-known that it cannot be assumed that child victims of sexual assault by a person who has the child's trust and confidence will complain at the first reasonable opportunity: M at 515, per Gaudron J; Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 12; 191 CLR 439 at 463, per Kirby J.
56I regard K's inaccuracies about what house she was living in when the incident occurred as peripheral and not adversely affecting her credit. At the age of seven, she had moved several times both with her mother, and also with BG. She could not necessarily be expected, when asked five years after the event, to remember such extraneous details, or to reliably report the location at which a particular event had occurred.
57A similar argument was put in M, when it was submitted that aspects of the complainant's evidence were unsatisfactory because she could not give details of the movie her father was watching at the relevant time and on an apparent inconsistency between her description of the movie as a ""cowboy and Indian"" one and the movies actually shown on that night. Gaudron J said, at 515 - 516:
""These matters must be assessed in the light of her evidence overall, the effect of which was that it was her father who was watching the movie and that he began touching her almost as soon as she sat down near him and concluded his assault by sending her to bed. In such circumstances, imprecision and even inconsistency is readily understood.""
58Although the distinction between the Broncos and the Eels is undoubtedly of significance to some, including presumably BG himself, it is hardly surprising that K was mistaken about the identity of the team whose shirt BG was wearing at the time of the offences. One can infer that BG and his friend were watching a sporting match on the relevant night, that BG was happy because his team was winning, and he was drinking to excess as a result, but that K was neither interested, nor aware of the details. That BG did not give evidence that he did not own an Eels shirt is some indication that his answer would not have assisted his case.
59It was put by BG's counsel on appeal that there was an issue of transference by reason of the presence, in the house that night, of another male, BG's friend; accordingly, the verdict was unreasonable. No such case was ever put at trial. It was never suggested to K that the man who interfered with her was not, in fact, BG but another man. In these circumstances, such a submission cannot conceivably found a doubt as to BG's guilt.
60To a substantial extent, K's evidence was corroborated by her mother, Meg and Julie. Melissa was, at the time of trial, not in a mental state which enabled her to be called. In my view the Crown has amply excluded the hypothesis consistent with innocence, that K fabricated the incident, beyond reasonable doubt.
61I do not have any doubt that BG was guilty of the offences charged. In those circumstances there is no reason for me to consider that a jury ought to have entertained any doubt.
Ground 2: the discharge of the juror and the refusal to discharge the jury
62There are two aspects to this ground: first, whether the trial judge's discretion to discharge a juror miscarried and secondly, whether the discretion to continue the trial with the balance of the jurors miscarried.
The relevant legislation
63Section 19 of the Jury Act 1977 (the Act) relevantly provides:
""19   Numbers of jurors in criminal proceedings
(1) Except as provided by section 22, in any criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court that are to be tried by jury, the jury is to consist of: 
(a) 12 persons ...""

64Section 22 of the Act relevantly provides for the continuation of trial on discharge of a juror in the following terms:
""22 Continuation of trial or inquest on death or discharge of juror
Where in the course of any trial or coronial inquest any member of the jury dies or is discharged by the court or coroner under Part 7A, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial or inquest properly constituted if: 
(a) in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members: 
(i) is not reduced below 10,
...
and if the court or the coroner, as the case may be, orders that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors under Part 7A.""

65Section 53B, which is contained in Part 7A of the Act, provides, relevantly, for the discretionary discharge of an individual juror if:
""(c) a juror refuses to take part in the jury's deliberations, or
(d) it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror's ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.""
66Section 53C of the Act relevantly provides:
""(1) If a juror dies, or the court or coroner discharges a juror in the course of a trial or coronial inquest, the court or coroner must: 
(a) discharge the jury if the court or coroner is of the opinion that to continue the trial or coronial inquest with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, or
(b) if of the opinion that there is no such risk and subject to section 22, order that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors.""
The facts surrounding the jury's deliberations and the discharge of one juror
67On Friday 5 November 2011, shortly before 4 pm, the jury retired to consider its verdict. The jury deliberated for less than half an hour before retiring for the weekend.
68On Monday 8 November 2011, the jury resumed its deliberations. Some transcript was unavailable and the jury requested that it be permitted to listen to a tape of K's examination in chief. Later, the DVD of the house in Satur Street was played to the jury. Before noon, after it had deliberated for about 40 minutes, the jury sent a note which said:
""There is no prospect that the jury will be able to come to an [sic] unanimous verdict.""
69Shortly after 2 pm the jury returned. The trial judge responded to the note by telling the jury:
""The circumstances in which I may take a verdict which is not a unanimous one have not yet arisen and you should still consider that your verdict of guilty or not guilty in relation to each count must be unanimous.""
70The jury then retired. It sent a further note, which was received at 3.45 pm, which said:
""Following further deliberations, the Jury is unable to come to a unanimous verdict on any one of the three counts in the indictment.""
71 At 4.15 pm, the jury returned to the Court. The trial judge said:
""At this point all I am able to do is encourage you to continue with your deliberations. I should say this to you. Circumstances in which I may take a verdict or verdicts which are not unanimous have not yet arisen and you should still consider that your verdict of guilty or not guilty must be unanimous.""
72Shortly thereafter, the jury sent a further note which said:
""The jury is able to deliberate tonight until 5.20 pm but is unable to continue beyond that time due to the family commitments of some members with small children and medical requirements of one member. Further, other members have significant work/ business commitments that may impact on their availability and ability to attend should the case continue into another day. It is emphasised that the Jury is satisfied that there is no prospect of a unanimous verdict on any count within the indictment based on a thorough review of the evidence presented.""
73At 5.20 pm, the jury sent another note which said:
""The Jury believes it is important to clarify that one jury member is self-employed and their business will be in jeopardy, as will the ongoing employment of their 5 staff if the case continues tomorrow.""
74BG's counsel noted his opposition to the discharge of the juror.
75At 5.25 pm, the jury returned to Court. The trial judge informed the jury that both notes had been received and asked the jury whether any arrangements could be made to alleviate the concerns of the juror and suggested that deliberations could begin at 9.00 am, 10.30 am or 11.00 am. In the absence of the jury, counsel calculated that the jury had deliberated for three hours.
76A further note was sent by the jury:
""No, the business owner is the only person authorised to complete aspects of the work due to accreditation requirements on government projects relating to critical infrastructure. The Jury requires access to a phone to make calls relating to children.""
77At about 5.45 pm, the trial judge foreshadowed her intention to discharge the juror with business concerns. BG's counsel reiterated his opposition to that course.
78At 5.48 pm, the jury returned to Court to be told that the trial judge ordered the discharge of the juror with business commitments. Her Honour then said:
""The jury will therefore continue as a jury of 11.""
79In the absence of the jury, the judge said:
""I want to note for the transcript that it was not only the unavailability of the juror in terms of work commitments, but the stress also and inability of that juror to be able to concentrate on the issue if indeed required to attend.""
80The jury resumed its deliberations at 9.00 am on Tuesday. At 11.30 am the jury sent a further note which said:
""Following further deliberations, the Jury is unable to come to a unanimous verdict on any of the three counts of the indictment.""
81The jury returned to the Court at 12.17 pm at which time the trial judge encouraged the jury to reach unanimous verdicts.
82Shortly after 3 pm, when the jury had been deliberating for a total of eight hours, the jury was returned to the Court. The foreperson gave sworn evidence that all jurors agreed that a unanimous verdict could not be reached. The trial judge then informed the jury that circumstances had arisen in which a majority verdict may be returned. Her Honour urged the jury to continue its deliberations with a view to returning a unanimous verdict but that if it became ""plainly impossible"", a verdict of ten out of eleven could be returned.
83The jury retired. It then sent a note which said:
""The jury has reached a majority verdict of ten (10) jurors on each of the counts in the indictment.""
84The jury returned to the Court at 3.43 pm and returned a majority verdict of 10:1 on all three counts. The jury was discharged at 3.48 pm
Whether the discretion to discharge a juror miscarried
85BG argued that the discretion to discharge the juror had miscarried because the judge did not take sworn evidence from the juror as to his or her business commitments or make any specific inquiry of the juror whether the commitments could be accommodated otherwise than by his or her discharge from the jury. BG submitted that the taking of sworn evidence was necessary to properly exercise the discretion in circumstances where the jury had already commenced its deliberations and indicated that it would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict.
86BG accepted that if the judge had elicited sworn evidence from the juror and satisfied herself that alternative arrangements could not be made, it was open to her Honour to discharge the juror, notwithstanding that the jury had already commenced its deliberations.
87There was, in my view, no reason for the judge to doubt the veracity of the report she received from the jury via its note and accordingly there was, in my view, no reason to require verification of the information by sworn evidence from the particular juror: see, for example, The Queen v Arnott [2009] VSCA 299; 26 VR 490 (Arnott), where a challenge to the trial judge's acceptance of a medical certificate in respect of a juror was rejected by the Victorian Court of Appeal, at [133].
88Further, I consider the inference was fairly open from the terms of the jury's notes that no alternative arrangements could be made to accommodate the juror who was subject to business commitments.
89I do not consider the discretion conferred by s 53B of the Act to discharge that juror miscarried.
Whether the discretion to continue with a jury of eleven miscarried
90Section 53C requires the Court to consider, once it has discharged a juror in the course of a trial, whether to continue the trial with a reduced number or discharge the whole jury. If the Court is of the opinion that to continue the trial with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, it is obliged to discharge the jury. However, if the Court is of the opinion that there is no such risk, it is obliged to order that the trial continue with a reduced number of jurors as long as the numbers do not fall below the statutory minimum provided for in s 22.
91As the High Court said in Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99 (Wu), there are relevantly two decisions to be made: first, whether a juror should be discharged, and secondly, whether the trial should continue with fewer jurors, or whether the whole jury ought be discharged. Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said, at [6]:
""The decision to discharge a juror and the decision to proceed with a jury of less than 12 are distinct steps and often will be affected by different considerations. The conduct of, or circumstances affecting, a single juror may require that juror's discharge. That conduct or those circumstances may not affect the other members of the jury or suggest that they cannot perform their task satisfactorily.""
92Statements to similar effect were made by McHugh J at [28] - [30] and Kirby J at [67].
93In Wu, the trial judge discharged a juror on the tenth day of a trial after a report was received that the juror was unwell and would probably not be able to attend court for two days. The trial proceeded to verdict by a jury constituted by the remaining eleven jurors. The accused contended that the trial had miscarried on the basis that an order for discharge ought not have been made. Unlike in the instant case, there was no challenge to the decision to continue the trial with the remaining jurors. The High Court affirmed the decision of this Court to dismiss the appeal against conviction. The Act was in different terms when Wu was decided in that Part 7A, which contains s 53A - s 53C, had not been enacted. However the relevant powers to discharge a juror and discharge the whole jury, or continue the trial with a fewer number were said to arise by implication from s 22 of the Act. 
94McHugh J emphasised the importance of the common law right to be tried by a jury of twelve and the associated right not to be convicted unless the twelve were unanimous. Although the common law right had been abrogated by the Act, McHugh J said, at [28]:
""... no one should think that, once a juror dies or is discharged, the trial should automatically continue with the remaining jurors.""
95McHugh J said that there must be a positive reason, beyond the discharge of a juror, for continuing the trial with a fewer number and said, at [29]:
""The usual reason for exercising the power under s 22 is that the trial has proceeded for some time and that it would cause significant expense to begin again with a new jury. No doubt the circumstances of individual trials will throw up other valid reasons. And there may be countervailing reasons. It may be a case dealing with matters upon which the opinion of the community is deeply divided. In such a case, despite the time that the trial has already taken, the proper exercise of the discretion may require that the accused be retried before a jury of 12. Or the case may be one where the community has strong feelings against the crime in question and the risk of prejudice against the accused may be strong. In such a case, depriving the accused of the chance to obtain the vote of the twelfth juror may be a step that should not be taken.""
96Kirby J said, of the factors involved in the decision whether to discharge the whole jury or to continue with a fewer number, at [66]:
""Involved in that decision are considerations quite separate from a decision to discharge an individual juror. For example, a different decision on such a question might be made at a very early stage of a long trial from that which would be appropriate at a late stage. A different decision might be made where, having regard to the circumstances of the discharge, an apprehension could arise that the entire jury could have been contaminated or their verdict cast into doubt by the events occasioning the discharge. A different decision might follow from an earlier discharge of other jurors and the complexity or fine balance of the evidence.""
97In the instant case, the Court did not make a separate order under s 53C; nor was there any explicit consideration of the issues that the provision required to be considered. No submissions were made as to whether, or on what basis, the Court should be of the opinion that to continue would give rise to the relevant risk or that it would not. No reasons were given.
98BG submitted that these omissions have the effect that the discretion to continue the trial with a reduced number miscarried and that the verdict ought accordingly be quashed. BG submitted that the inference was available that the juror with commitments was the one who was holding out and preventing a unanimous verdict. He submitted that because there had not been any verification required of such commitments, there was at least the appearance that the reasons given were not valid.
99The Crown submitted that no such inference fairly arises. It would amount to no more than speculation to suppose that the juror with commitments was a factor in the jury being unable to reach a unanimous verdict. All that can be said with confidence is that some jurors change their minds in deliberations and some do not.
100The Crown submitted that the lack of reasons, though regrettable, was not fatal to the continuation of the trial since a s 53C order is an interlocutory one. Therefore, the test is not whether the reasons were adequate or otherwise, but rather whether the decision was correct. It relied on what Heydon J, with whom Kiefel J agreed, said in Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; 235 CLR 521 at [246] - [247]. Heydon J said, at [247]:
""It was contended for the accused that the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in failing to uphold the appeal on grounds of procedural fairness and erred in inferring the reasons for the rulings from what was said in argument. One thing that matters is whether the rulings were correct: they were. Another thing that matters is that miscarriages of justice be avoided, as distinct from procedural errors which are regrettable but do not cause any miscarriage of justice. The failure to give reasons can be procedurally unfair, but procedural unfairness is not to be looked for in the air: counsel for the accused in this Court failed to demonstrate how either his predecessor or their client was in any way worse off because of the failure to give reasons in this case.""
101In the light of Evans, the lack of reasons is not determinative. It falls to this Court to decide whether it is of the opinion that for the trial judge to continue the trial with the remaining jurors gave rise to a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
Analysis of relevant principles
102The precise point that arises in this case does not appear to have arisen before either in Australia, the UK, Canada or the US. Nonetheless a review of the authorities which counsel have brought to the attention of the Court enable certain principles to be distilled. 
103On my analysis of the cases, there are three categories of case in which the question arises whether the trial should continue with the remaining jurors when one juror has been discharged. These are:
(1)Where there is no indication how the discharged juror would have voted;
(2)Where there is evidence from which it can be inferred prospectively that the discharged juror would, if not discharged, have voted for an acquittal; and
(3)Where it can be inferred, but only with the benefit of hindsight, that the juror who was discharged would, if not discharged, have voted for an acquittal.
104By and large, the effect of the authorities is that is not appropriate for the trial judge to order, after the discharge of a juror or jurors, that the trial continue with the remaining jurors if the case falls into either the second or the third categories. In such cases, there is a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice: it is one thing for an accused person to lose a right to be tried by a jury of twelve; it is quite another for such a person to lose a juror whom could reasonably be inferred, even if only with the benefit of hindsight, to have been at least unwilling to convict, if not determined to acquit.
105What occurs in a jury room is beyond the province of the Court. Such an inquiry has long been held to be impermissible: AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at [99], per Heydon J. What distinguishes categories 2 and 3 from category 1 is that in those categories, something is known or can be inferred about what has transpired in the jury room such as to give rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice if the trial continues with the remaining jurors.
Category 1: no indication that rises above speculation as to how a discharged juror would have voted
106In Arnott, Arnott argued unsuccessfully that, by the discharge of a juror who was ill, he had lost the chance of a dissentient juror. On 3 January 2007, at the conclusion of Arnott's second trial a jury found him guilty of murder on 3 March 1985, He had been arrested and interviewed on 4 August 2004, and had then been remanded in custody. He had been committed for trial in July 2005, and had stood trial in March and April 2006. The jury had been unable to agree upon a verdict, and had been discharged without verdict on 17 April 2006.
107Arnott argued, relevantly, that the judge had placed too much weight on the significance of the cost and expense which had been incurred. The Crown argued that it could not be said that any fault in the exercise of the judge's discretion to discharge the juror had led to a miscarriage of justice and submitted that it was speculative that the applicant lost the chance of a dissentient juror. The Victorian Court of Appeal found the exercise of discretion ""unremarkable"". Ashley JA, with whom Nettle and Redlich JJA agreed, said, at [134]:
""Her Honour focussed upon the speculative matters raised by the applicant's counsel, and rejected them on a logical basis.""
108The decision whether a juror's view is sufficiently known to take the case out of the first category is a matter of judgment. For example, in R v Hahn 1995 CarswellBC 1238 (Hahn), the British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against conviction. The jury had begun its deliberations when a note was sent informing the judge that jurors felt that they could not convict on the basis of circumstantial evidence. Further notes were sent and eventually the trial judge decided to question a juror who had expressed a conscientious objection. The juror had difficulty in expressing the basis for the objection but did say:
""it's almost like my own personal philosophy is closer to that of the defence counsel versus the counsel for the Crown""
109After lengthy questioning, the trial judge discharged the juror. The remaining jurors were then directed about circumstantial evidence and the meaning of beyond reasonable doubt. The appeal from the trial judge's decision to discharge the juror was rejected.
110The timing of the disclosure of the discharged juror's intention is also significant. In R v Peters 1999 BCCA 406 (Peters) the British Colombia Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against a conviction for manslaughter. One of the grounds of appeal was the discharge of a juror after two days of deliberations. In that case, the jury sent a note to the judge to the effect that one juror did not feel able to judge his fellow man, since it was a matter for God. The judge then examined the juror. In the course of the examination, the juror said:
""I feel that my only conclusion will be acquittal.""
111Following the examination, the juror was discharged, contrary to the submissions of defence counsel. A verdict of guilty was returned by the remaining jurors the following morning. McEachern CJBC referred to the juror's plan to acquit the accused and said, at [81]:
""In most cases, it is highly desirable that a judge deciding to discharge a juror on any ground does not know how that juror, or any juror, plans to vote. Once the judge knows this important fact, at least the appearance of fairness is open to challenge.
...Applying the foregoing to this case, some might think that justice does not appear to be done when a judge, knowing the juror is committed to acquit, removes that juror from the case. On the other hand, if the juror is not prepared to discharge his responsibility, he should be discharged, particularly when the other ten are prepared to carry on.""
112McEachern CJBC distinguished R v Latimer [1990] OJ No. 401 (Latimer) (referred to below) and said that the decision came down to an assessment of fairness. His Honour considered it to be significant that the juror disclosed that he was not prepared to discharge his responsibilities as a juror before he ""blurted out"" what his verdict would be. In those circumstances, the trial was held not to be unfair. Goldie and Proudfoot JJA concurred with this reasoning and the appeal was dismissed accordingly.
113Although the result in Peters was that the appeal was dismissed, the trial judge's decision appears to have been upheld on the basis that the discharge of the juror was appropriate in light of the note, before the juror was examined and disclosed his intentions. Nonetheless Peters is an apparently anomalous decision, since it appears to fit into the second category and yet the decision to continue after the discharge of the juror was upheld. R v Roberts [2004] QCA 366; (2005) 1 Qd R 408 (Roberts) (see below) is some indication that Peters would be decided differently in Australia.
114The cases from the US are not as relevant since US statutory provisions allow for replacement of discharged jurors by alternates (see Wu footnote 65, per Kirby J). However White (petitioner) v Knowles (warden) 2011 WL 1196053 (ND Cal) is of interest because of its factual similarity to the instant case.
115In White, the petitioner sought habeas corpus in the US District Court, ND California on the ground that his due process right to a fair trial was violated by the trial court's dismissal of ""holdout jurors"". The District Court referred to authority to the effect that even if a trial court knew an excused juror was the sole dissentient for acquittal, it would not of itself invalidate the decision to discharge the juror, although a court was not entitled to discharge a juror if the request for discharge stemmed from doubts about the sufficiency of the prosecutor's case.
116In White, two jurors asked to be excused during deliberations on the grounds of pressing work commitments. The court questioned the jurors to evaluate the legitimacy and seriousness of their claimed financial hardships. Neither counsel objected, either to the questions or to the discharges. The jurors were discharged and alternates appointed. The petitioner reiterated before the District Court the submissions he had put before the state court that the jurors' notes ought to have put the court on notice that they were ""holdouts"" on what was going to be a hung jury and that the court was obliged to make an enquiry about the existence of a potential deadlock before discharging the two jurors.
117The state court (in which the petitioner had been convicted) said:
""The only basis for this contention is speculative inferences. [The Petitioner] construes the jurors' notes as indicating a deadlock. He further infers that because the reconstituted jury reached a verdict a mere two days later, the deadlock must have been attributable to the dismissed jurors holding out. The concluding part of this reasoning, of course, could not have been known at the time the court dismissed the two jurors. [The Petitioner's] argument assumes an unreasonable amount of clairvoyance and takes no account of other, obvious factors and explanations.""
118The District Court agreed with the conclusions of the state court and dismissed the writ.
Category 2: indication of how the discharged juror would have voted prior to the return of verdict
119In Roberts, the trial judge was informed that one of the jurors was adamant in his views, would not discuss the evidence and was argumentative and overbearing with the other members of the jury. The judge was also informed that, apart from this dissentient juror, the remaining eleven members of the jury agreed on a verdict. The judge elicited evidence from several jurors, but not the juror complained of. The evidence established that that juror was in a minority of one when it came to the verdict. At that time, majority verdicts were not authorised.
120The relevant provision, s 56 of the Jury Act 1995 (Qld), provided that if it appears to the judge from the juror's own statements or evidence that the juror was not impartial or ought not, for other reasons, be allowed or required to act as a juror, the judge may, without discharging the whole jury, discharge the juror. The judge was persuaded that the juror ought be discharged because he was not impartial. However the judge decided not to discharge the whole jury. The appellant was convicted by unanimous verdict of a jury of eleven. 
121On appeal, the Queensland Court of Appeal considered that it was not clear that the juror who was discharged was not impartial, since lack of impartiality could not be inferred from a refusal to discuss evidence. But, more relevantly for present purposes, Cullinane J, with whom McPherson JA and White J agreed, said, at [46] - [48]:
""To discharge a juror at a time when it is known that the jury is in a state of disagreement and that the juror, who is discharged, is the sole dissenter carries the risk of giving rise to the perception that an obstacle to a verdict has been removed and a verdict of the remaining 11 gives rise in those circumstances to the perception that there has been, in the result, a majority verdict, something which the law of this State does not permit.
The public perception includes as well as the general perception of the public that of the accused and the jurors concerned.
In my view the course which His Honour took has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The verdict should be set aside and a new trial ordered."" 122White J said, in the context of majority verdicts not being authorised, at [6]:
""To discharge only the dissentient, particularly when it was known that the other 11 held an opposing view about the verdict, would suggest a majority verdict was being permitted.""
123In R v Fontaine 2002 MBCA 107 (Fontaine) the Manitoba Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from a conviction for murder and ordered a new trial. After the jury had begun its deliberations a note was sent informing the judge that the jury was unable to reach a decision on the charge of murder. The judge urged the jury to seek to reach a unanimous verdict. The jury sent a second note in which it informed the judge that 11 jurors were in agreement but that one juror would not change his or her mind. In different handwriting, there was also an inquiry whether one juror could speak with the judge. 
124The following morning a note was sent to the judge that two jurors were ill. The two jurors were called in and summarily discharged by the judge with no investigation as to the nature of their illness or the length of time that they would be absent. Counsel were not heard on the discharge. 
125None of the three notes was disclosed to counsel although the substance of the first could be inferred from the judge's exhortation. After four hours, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The Manitoba Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a retrial. It applied what was said in Latimer and said, at [73] - [74]:
""Applying these comments [Latimer] to the instant case, it is obvious that there was at least one hold-out in the deliberations. For the trial judge to then exclude two jurors (with the possibility that one was the hold-out) as she did, and in the absence of counsel's knowledge of the contents of the two notes, affected the vital interests of the accused to his prejudice.
Moreover, and equally as important, it leaves the accused with the perception that his conviction had something to do with the notes, the contents of which he was not allowed to know. This perception inflicts damage on the appearance of justice, a factor which must be taken into account. See R v Laws (1998), 128 C.C.C. (3d) 516 (Ont. C.A.) and Cloutier.
Category 3: no indication of how the discharged juror would have voted except with the benefit of hindsight following the return of verdict
126In R v Goodson [1975] 1 WLR 549 (Goodson), the appellant was charged with several offences to which he pleaded guilty and was also charged with burglary to which he pleaded not guilty. About an hour after the jury had retired to consider their verdict, one of the jurors was given permission by the jury bailiff to leave the jury room. He was subsequently found making a telephone call. The juror was prevented from returning to the jury room. The jury returned and the court was informed of what had happened. The recorder decided that although the juror's absence was an irregularity, no material prejudice would be suffered by the appellant if the trial continued with a jury of only 11 members, since the remaining jurors were not aware of what had transpired in the course of the telephone call. Accordingly, under the provisions of s 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 1965 (UK), the recorder discharged the juror who had made the telephone call. 
127The remaining 11 jurors, who had been present in court listening to arguments on the incidents, then returned verdicts on counts in respect of which they acquitted the accused. They had not reached a verdict on the count which was the subject of the appeal. After a further short direction, they retired again for some five minutes or so before returning a verdict of guilty on the charge of burglary. The appellant appealed against conviction.
128The UK Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction on the basis that a material irregularity had occurred. The Court said, 762:
""In this case when one looks at the facts, as has been pointed out in the course of argument, this is clear: that the appellant was deprived of the voice of one juryman in the jury room in the consideration of the verdict from which the appeal is made.
From what has been said in argument it is quite clear that there is abundant room for speculation and where there is room for speculation there is, we think, room for possible injustice, possible injustice to the appellant in respect of this conviction.""
129Although in Goodson the Court did not articulate what the ""room for speculation"" was, it is possible that the Court was referring to the inference the juror who was discharged was the sole dissentient, which arose from the relatively short time between the discharge of the juror and the verdicts being returned. Although the Court in Godson used the word ""speculation"", I consider that the circumstances in that case gave rise to more than mere speculation, since the inference was fairly open that the discharged juror was the sole dissentient.
130In Latimer the Ontario Court of Appeal set aside a conviction and ordered a new trial. In that case, after eight and a half hours of deliberation, one juror sought a discharge from the jury on the grounds of mental distress. The judge examined the juror in private and excused her. Within 25 minutes, the remaining jurors returned a verdict of guilty. The appeal appears to have been allowed on two bases: first, that there was a denial of natural justice (since the examination occurred in private) and secondly, that the reasonable inference was that the discharged juror was the dissentient and was in favour of an acquittal.
The instant case
131BG argued that it could be inferred that the reason given by the juror who sought to be discharged was a ruse because the trial judge did not examine the juror and accordingly the legitimacy and seriousness of his asserted business commitments were not tested. 
132Although trial judges commonly examine a juror prior to discharge (see, for example, R v Derbas (1993) 66 A Crim R 327), this is not necessary in all cases. In the absence of evidence, I do not consider that it is open for this Court to infer either that the single juror gave a reason that was disingenuous or that either the jury as a whole, or its foreperson collaborated in misleading the Court as to the reason why the juror felt unable to continue.
133BG sought to persuade this Court that there was at least room for speculation that the discharged juror was a dissentient. Accordingly, he argued that he was exposed to a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice by the trial judge's decision to continue the trial with 11, rather than 12, jurors.
134Unlike in Roberts, Peters or Fontaine, there was no disclosure of either the split, or the views of the discharged juror. Nor did the timing of the verdict or the composition of the majority verdict lead to an inference of how the discharged juror would have voted if not discharged. Unlike in Goodson and Latimer, no inference could be reliably drawn with benefit of hindsight as to these matters. The instant case is similar to the US case of White: it was a matter of speculation how the discharged juror would have voted. It falls within the first category.
135The proposition that it could reasonably be inferred that the discharged juror was a dissentient is the only matter that has been advanced as giving rise to the risk referred to in s 53C. In those circumstances, I am not of the opinion that to continue the trial with the remaining jurors gave rise to a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.
136Accordingly I consider that the trial judge's decision to continue the trial with a jury of eleven was within a proper exercise of discretion. Evidence, addresses and the summing up had all concluded. The cost, in financial and personal terms of ordering a retrial was a relevant factor in the decision to continue the trial with fewer than twelve jurors: R v Metius [2009] QCA 3; (2009) 2 Qd R 442. There was no basis for considering that the discharge of one juror compromised the ability of the remaining jurors to carry out their function
Importance of reasons
137The trial judge's failure to address s 53C explicitly and separately from her decision to discharge a juror did not affect the result, since I have found that her Honour's decisions to discharge the juror and continue the trial with the remaining jurors were within a proper exercise of discretion. However, it is highly desirable that trial judges, when an occasion for the discharge of a juror arises, state not only the reasons for discharging a juror, or refusing to do so, but also the reasons for continuing the trial with the remaining jurors or discharging the whole jury. 
138Although this Court can, as it has done in the instant case, undertake the task itself of determining whether the decisions made by the trial judge are correct, or amount to a proper exercise of the discretion, it is preferable that the reasons for a trial judge's decisions on these matters are expressed. Not only do reasons assist in permitting the accused in particular to understand the basis of the decision, but they are, if expressed, available to this Court. In the absence of reasons this Court is left to infer from the circumstances of the trial what the reasons were, or might have been, if the correct question had been asked and the statutory provisions expressly addressed and considered.
Orders
139For the foregoing reasons, neither ground of appeal has been made out. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
140Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
1 Grant leave to appeal.
2 Order that the appeal be dismissed.

		10 July 2012",2012-07-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759664,R v. Alexandra Jane Martin [2012] NSWSC 801,"Judgment
1.The applicant seeks ""appeal"" bail.  She was convicted upon her plea of guilty in the District Court of New South Wales on 30th May 2012 of an offence under s.112(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence therein.  The serious indictable offence was assault occasioning actual bodily harm on an occupant of the dwelling.  
2.The applicant had entered her plea of guilty to the offence at the earliest available opportunity when the matter was brought before the Local Court at Dubbo on 7th March 2012.  
3.The maximum penalty prescribed for this offence is a term of imprisonment of 14 years.
4.The learned sentencing Judge, Acting Judge Lerve (as he then was), remarked that no sentence other than a sentence of full time custody was appropriate.  In forming this view, his Honour accepted the Crown submission that there is a very significant issue of general deterrence (page 8).  His Honour added:
I have dealt with far too many matters in my time ... where people far too quickly resort to violence over some personal insult or slur.
5.His Honour reasoned further:
Having decided that no other sentence other than a sentence of custody is appropriate, the next issue to be determined is the length of the sentence.  In all of the circumstances, I am of the opinion the appropriate starting point is the vicinity of 20 months from which is to be deducted 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.  That leaves a total sentence of 15 months.
6.His Honour rejected a secondary submission put on behalf of the applicant that any sentence of imprisonment should be suspended. However, he considered that the subjective features were such that it is appropriate to make a very substantial finding of special circumstances for the purpose of s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to vary the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence.
7.His Honour sentenced the applicant to:
a non-parole period of six months to date from today 30th May 2012 expiring on 29th November 2012.  Thereafter, I specify a period on parole or balance of term of 9 months to commence on 30th November 2012 expiring on 29th August 2013.
8.In accordance with the provisions of s.50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, given the length of the term, his Honour made an order directing the applicant's release on parole at the end of the non-parole period.
9.The applicant has sought the leave of the Court of Criminal Appeal to appeal against her sentence under s.5 Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  Her grounds of appeal and written submissions in support (filed on 14th June 2012) were handed up when the application for bail came before me sitting in the Bails Court on Thursday, 12th July 2012.  The leave application and appeal are listed for hearing on 26th October 2012. By that time she will have served just 4 days short of the first 5 months of the effective term of imprisonment in the case.  
Power of disposition 
10.Although an appeal is pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal against the sentence passed on conviction or indictment, in my judgment I am empowered to deal with the application. Section 28 of the Bail Act 1978 (NSW) (""Bail Act"") is in the following terms:
The Supreme Court may grant bail in accordance with this Act to any person accused of any offence, whether or not the person has appeared before the Supreme Court in connection with the offence.
11.The construct a person accused of an offence extends to a person convicted of an offence, and a person in respect of whom an appeal relating to an offence is pending (s.4(2) Bail Act). That the Court of Criminal Appeal is empowered by s. 30 Bail Act to grant bail in such a case does not diminish the powers of the Supreme Court, as such: R. v. Hilton (1987) 7 NSWLR 745 at 746B; 747E per Street CJ, with whom Hunt and Rogers JJ agreed; R. v. Antoun [2005] NSWCCA 270 at [3] - [4] per the Court.
12.Moreover, the central provision establishing the condition upon which appeal bail may be granted, s.30AA Bail Act, makes clear that the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is not exclusive.  
The statutory requirement
13.Section 30AA Bail Act is in the following terms:
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, if:
(a)  an appeal is pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal against: 
(i)  a conviction on indictment, or(ii)  a sentence passed on conviction on indictment, or
(b)  an appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal is pending in the High Court in relation to an appeal referred to in paragraph (a),
bail shall not be granted by the Court of Criminal Appeal or any other court unless it is established that special or exceptional circumstances exist justifying the grant of bail (my emphasis). 
14.As the learned authors of Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW, Howie and Johnson, point out at p.187,751 [9 - 730.1], s.30AA was enacted in response to the recommendation made in that regard by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Hilton at 751C per Street CJ, 753 per Hunt J. In that decision, the Court held that the Bail Act is a comprehensive and exclusive code (at 751A) which excludes the continued application of the previous common law principle applied in New South Wales in respect of bail pending an appeal that a person who seeks bail pending his appeal from conviction or sentence must establish special or exceptional circumstances:  Hilton at 746D per Street CJ; R. v. Southgate (1960) 78 WN (NSW) 44; R v Giordano (1982) 31 SASR 241 at 241 per King CJ. By necessary implication, that principle was abrogated by the enactment of the Bail Act: Hilton (751A). And in my judgment it may be accepted that s.30AA not only re-establishes the common law test but also the relevance of the considerations previously taken to have enlivened it.  
15.Associate Professor John Willis has reviewed the case law in various Australian jurisdictions in his article, Bail Pending Appeal After Conviction and Sentence on Indictment (2005) 29(5) Crim LJ 296. He has demonstrated that the considerations are similar whether s.30AA, or an interstate equivalent, on the one hand, or the common law, on the other, applies (pp 297).
16.It is important to bear in mind just how high the bar has been set.  In Re. Clarkson [1986] VR 583 at 584 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria wrote of the difficulty of persuading the court that the circumstances put forward as special or exceptional are strong enough to overcome the powerful considerations of a general character which militate against the grant of bail pending appeal.   
The submissions of the parties
17.In Giordano, King CJ pointed out that the totality of the circumstances must be looked at (at 243).  I draw attention to this statement now because it makes clear that the grant of bail pending appeal does not depend upon the establishment of fixed or closed categories of case.  Indeed, the Crown's written submissions accepted as much.  Mr. D. Curran, solicitor, who appeared for the Crown said in written argument:
Examples of special circumstances could be that a sentence is likely to expire prior to the appeal being determined.  It is not sufficient for an applicant to establish an arguable case on appeal.  What must be established is a ground of appeal which ""can be seen without detailed argument to be certain to succeed"" per Hunt CJ at common law in R. v. Wilson (1994) 34 NSWLR 1 at 7 cited with approval in R. v. Charbel Rahme [2003] NSWCA 135.
18.Ms. A. Francis of Counsel laid some emphasis upon the strength of the case on appeal. In oral argument she referred to it as ""powerful"", and supported this contention by handing up a copy of the written submissions that had been filed. I certainly did not however understand her to rely upon this ground alone. By reference to the mandatory requirements of s.32 of the Bail Act, she argued that the applicant is an ""exceptional candidate for bail"". She argued that a very significant aspect of the application is that, as has been noted above, the applicant would by the time of the hearing on 26th October 2012 have served just short of five months of the non-parole period, and it could not be predicted when judgment might be handed down. By reference to Antoun at [14] - [15], Ms. Francis argued that s.30AA is not limited to a consideration of the prospect of success on appeal and there are potentially other circumstances that might merit the grant of bail.  
Disposition
19.Implicit in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Wilson is the idea that there are a variety of circumstances that may constitute special or exceptional circumstances. Only where the sole ground advanced to satisfy the statutory test is the strength of the argument on appeal, does the test require something more than an arguable point in the Court of Criminal Appeal (applying R. v. Waters (1990) 9 Petty SR 4016 per Badgery-Parker J).  Kirby P, with whom Sheller JA agreed, (at 6) expressed the test as follows:
The applicant must be most likely to succeed. This is because of the obstacle which the legislature has put in the way of the grant of bail by requiring the demonstration of special or exceptional circumstances.
It is not clear to me that Hunt CJ at CL was proposing, in substance, a more stringent test when he said at [7]:
Where the prospects of success on the appeal are put forward as a special circumstance ... what must be established is a ground of appeal which is certain to succeed - and one which can be seen without detailed argument to be certain to succeed.
I make this observation bearing in mind that (at 6B) Kirby P said:
It is important that, in this application, this Court should not pre-judge the arguments which the applicant intends to advance before the Court of Criminal Appeal.
20.A bail application must be addressed in a more or less summary fashion in the vast majority of cases.  For that obvious reason, unless there is an air of certainty of outcome about the pending appeal, the primary decision maker would need to second guess the Court of Criminal Appeal without the opportunity to undertake the detailed consideration available on a full hearing of the appeal.  To the extent to which it may be relevant, the grounds advanced on behalf of the applicant seem arguable, perhaps better than arguable, and this may be a relevant factor in considering the totality of the circumstances.
21.That the applicant may be otherwise an exceptional candidate for bail does not of itself suffice, although this consideration must have some relevance. As King CJ said in Giordano at 242:  
Before and during trial, the primary, although not the only, consideration is whether the applicant will appear when required to do so. This consideration has only a minor bearing on the grant of bail after conviction. Obviously bail after conviction would not be granted unless the circumstances were such as would have indicated bail before and during trial. After conviction, however, other cogent factors also come into consideration.
22.As the Crown submissions themselves acknowledge, the likelihood that the whole or a major part of a custodial sentence will have been served before the hearing of the appeal is itself capable of rising to special or exceptional circumstances. Indeed, as Assoc. Professor Willis points out (at p. 297) this is the ground on which most successful bail applications have been based.  
23.In Re. Jackson [1997] 2 VR 1 at 2 Callaway JA, who gave the judgment of the Court said:
The likelihood that an applicant will have served the whole or a very substantial part of the sentence before his application for leave to appeal and appeal, if the application is granted, are heard is often regarded as sufficient to satisfy the requirement of very exceptional circumstances to which I shall refer later in this judgment, always depending on the nature of the offences and the grounds of appeal and the other attendant factors.
See also Ex Parte Maher [1986] 1 Qd R 303 at 312 per Thomas J; Chew v. the Queen (No. 2) (1991) 66 ALJR 221 per Toohey J; Doggett  v. The Queen (unreported), High Court of Australia, Callinan J, 2nd November 2000; Marotta v. the Queen (1999) 73 ALJR 265 at 267 per Callinan J.
24.There is some debate about whether the focus should be only on the custodial portion of the term of imprisonment or whether one must have regard to the whole sentence. In Re. Jackson itself the Court suggested that one should look at the whole term. However, in Chew, Doggett and Re. Pennant [1997] 2 VR 85 it is said that the custodial part of the sentence is the relevant consideration. It is not necessary for me to resolve any tension between the different approaches here. As stated at paragraph 8, the primary judge has ordered the applicants release at the expiration of the non-parole period in compliance with s.50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and there can be no suggestion that the applicant will serve longer.
25.That by the date of the hearing of the appeal most of the applicant's custodial sentence will have been served, and that by the date of judgment that sentence may well have been fully served, is a powerful factor favouring the grant of bail in the present case. This has been tacitly acknowledged by the Crown in as much as it refers to the alternative possibility that an expedited hearing may be available. However, I was informed from the bar table that the matter  had only recently been fixed for hearing and that the first available date had been sought.  I do not understand this to mean that expedition is unavailable.  However, Ms Francis informed me that the transcript of this sentencing hearing is not yet available. Nor have the submissions on behalf of the Crown in relation to the leave application and appeal yet been prepared. Assuming that an expedited hearing may be available, one is still left with the position that a large proportion of the applicant's sentence will already have been served when the appeal is heard, even if the hearing date is brought forward markedly. In my judgment the potential for the hearing to be expedited is not, in the circumstances of this case, a reason to deny bail.
26.I need to remind myself, however, that the totality of the circumstances are not exhausted by reference to the position of the applicant alone.  In United Mexican States v. Cabal (2001) 209 CLR 165 at 181 [39] - [40] the Court said:  
In determining whether to stay an order of imprisonment and give bail to the applicant or appellant, the court must consider not only the position of the applicant or appellant, but also the position of the Crown.  To stay an order of imprisonment before deciding the appeal is a serious interference with the due administration of criminal justice.  As Thomas J pointed out in Ex Parte Maher [at 310], to allow bail pending the hearing of an appeal after a person has been convicted and imprisoned:  
makes the conviction appeal contingent until confirmed;places the court in the invidious position of having to return to prison a person who circumstances may have changed dramatically during the period at liberty on bail;encourages unmeritorious appeals; undermines respect for the judicial system in having a ""recently sentenced man walking free"";undermines the public interest in having convicted persons serve their sentence as soon as practicable.
Consequently, the doctrine of this Court is that in a criminal case an order granting bail will only be made if there are exceptional circumstances.
27.Their Honours went on to demonstrate that in the High Court a very strong case needs to be made for a grant of bail because ordinarily such an application is made to it after trial and an intermediate appeal. The approach required in this case is not so stringent because no appellate court has considered the case and dismissed an appeal: Peters v. The Queen (1996) 71 ALJR 309 at 310 per Dawson J; see also Cabal at [43].  
28.Reference should be made to the fundamental significance of the verdict of a jury in the administration of criminal justice: Chamberlain v. The Queen (No. 1) (1983) 153 CLR 514 at 519-520 per Brennan J. But given the applicant's early plea that aspect is not pertinent here, and, by definition, where it exists it is not a factor telling decisively against a grant of bail: Marotta per Callinan J at 266. 
29.A matter that has concerned me is that the applicant will need to be returned to prison to complete the custodial portion of her sentence if her appeal is unsuccessful.  Doubtless, imprisonment imposes great hardship on prisoners.  The necessity to contemplate a resumption of the term upon the dismissal of the appeal may impose greater hardship still once the offender has re-experienced liberty.  However, if that is so, that additional hardship is a natural consequence of the applicant herself seeking bail. With great respect, I cannot put it any better than Callinan J did in Doggett:
Of course, bail may not always be in the interest of an applicant after conviction.  His circumstances may change while he is on bail.  A return to incarceration after an unsuccessful appeal and at a time when all or most of his actual term of imprisonment would have been served may have far worse psychological and other consequences for a prisoner than uninterrupted service of his sentence.  No doubt few applicants would believe that but it is, nonetheless likely to be so in many cases.
Conditional Bail
30.In the present case I am satisfied that the applicant has established special or exceptional circumstances justifying a grant of conditional bail.  Whilst I have primarily had regard to the consideration that the custodial portion of her sentence will probably have expired by the time a decision, in the ordinary course of events, might have been given by the Court of Criminal Appeal, I have also had regard to the fact that the grounds of appeal in this case seem better than arguable, and that the s.32 considerations favour the applicant.  
31.In coming to the conclusion that s.32 favours the grant of bail I have borne in mind that, as a general proposition, it may be said that the risk of non-appearance may be greater in the case of bail pending appeal than otherwise given that the applicant has suffered the disappointment of being subject to a custodial sentence which he or she will not wish to resume.  However, I am of the view that this particular risk can be effectively guarded against by the imposition of appropriate conditions, perhaps stricter than those suggested by Ms Francis.
32.Moreover, I have taken into account the findings of the sentencing Judge that the commission of the offence is entirely out of character for the applicant; that the author of the pre-sentence report opined that she was a suitable candidate for community service; that the material as to the applicant's personal circumstances tendered before the sentencing Judge was regarded by his Honour as impressive; and that his Honour found very little likelihood of the applicant ever re-offending. Indeed, in view of his Honour's very substantial finding of special circumstances (ROS page 9), as I understand his remarks read as a whole, he was motivated not so much by the consideration of adequate punishment as by the factor of general deterrence, the need for which he referred to a number of times.
33.The applicant has strong community ties, had full time employment and was undertaking a TAFE course to qualify her as a youth worker.  She is only 20 years of age, has no prior criminal record, and, no doubt, has found the experience of the last 6 weeks salutary.
34.I have concluded that:
(a)there is a very high degree of probability that the applicant will appear in the Court of Criminal Appeal on the hearing of her application for leave to appeal and appeal;
(b)her interests tell in favour of the grant of bail, particularly having regard to subparagraphs (i), (iii), and (vi) of paragraph (b) of s.32(1);
(c)given her previous good character, and her remorse, the need for the protection of the victim or any other person is slight, but for better precaution I will impose conditions in that regard;
(d)the protection and welfare of the community will not be offended or put at risk by the release of the applicant on bail; each of the subparagraphs of s.32(1)(c) tells in favour of granting the application.
35.My order is that the applicant is granted bail pending her appearance before the Court of Criminal Appeal for the hearing of her leave application and appeal on 26th October 2012.
36.Bail is conditional as follows:
(1)The applicant is to be of good behaviour in all respects.
(2)The applicant is to reside at 3/60 Taylor Street, Darlinghurst New South Wales with her mother, Jacquelyn Martin.
(3)The applicant is to report to the officer in charge of the Surry Hills police station within 24 hours of her release to the bail now granted and thereafter between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays of each week.
(4)One acceptable person is to enter into an agreement to forfeit the sum of $5,000 if the applicant fails to comply with her bail undertaking, such agreement is to be secured by cash deposit.  Any person acceptable to the justice to whom cash security is tendered is acceptable to the Court.
(5)The applicant is to surrender any current passport held by her to the officer in charge of police at Surry Hills police station. She is to do so upon the first reporting as required by condition 3 above.
(6)The applicant is not to apply for any new passport or travel documents.
(7)The applicant is not to approach any point of departure from this country, whether by air or sea. (8)The applicant is not to go within 50 kilometres of the city of Dubbo.
(9)The applicant is not to approach, contact or attempt to contact, directly or indirectly, Shayne Pepperell.
(10)The applicant is to prosecute her appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal with all due diligence.
(11)Bail may be entered before any person authorised under the Bail Act.
(12)Should the applicant be in breach of any of the conditions which I have imposed, her bail will be automatically revoked and she may be arrested by any police officer and returned to custody.

2759671,Younan v R [2012] NSWCCA 155,"Judgment

1HOEBEN JA : I agree with Latham J.

2LATHAM J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Flannery SC DCJ on 17 November 2010 in respect of two counts of importing a marketable quantity of heroin, pursuant to s 307.2 (1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.

3The applicant was convicted after trial. On the first count, her Honour imposed a term of 5 years and 9 months imprisonment. On the second count her Honour imposed a term of 6 years and 2 months imprisonment. The sentence on count two was accumulated on the sentence for count one to the extent of 3 months, resulting in an aggregate sentence of 7 years and 5 months. Her Honour set an aggregate non parole period of 4 years and 6 months.

4The applicant alleges error in the manner in which her Honour dealt with the application of what has come to be known as the Ellis discount (R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603). Further, the applicant alleges error in her Honour's failure to find that the applicant was remorseful. Finally, the applicant complains that the sentence is manifestly excessive and that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.

5The circumstances of the applicant's offending fall within a short compass. The applicant travelled to Thailand on two occasions at the request of a co-offender, Sam Isaac, in January and March of 2009. On the first occasion, the applicant returned to Sydney, wearing a pair of shoes that were provided to him in Thailand and which concealed 537 g of pure heroin. 

6On the second occasion, the applicant aided and abetted the importation by a co-offender, Akram Hanna, of 642 g of pure heroin, secreted within a pair of shoes worn by Mr Hanna, by recruiting Mr Hanna, making travel arrangements for himself and Mr Hanna, travelling to Thailand with Mr Hanna and Mr Isaac, and assisting Mr Hanna at Bangkok Airport for his return to Sydney. The applicant was also provided with shoes that contained a quantity of heroin. It was proposed that the applicant would return to Sydney on a separate flight. When it became apparent that Mr Hanna had been arrested at Sydney airport, the applicant refused to continue with the planned importation and returned the shoes to Mr Isaac while still in Thailand. When the applicant returned to Australia, he sought and received $10,000 from Mr Isaac in order to conceal his knowledge of the drug importation activities of Mr Isaac and others.

7Following a conversation with Mr Isaac, wherein it was intimated that the applicant might be in jeopardy, the applicant went to police on 12 May 2009. On that day, and again on 4 June and 2 July 2009, the applicant participated in a number of interviews. He disclosed his own involvement in those importations and the involvement of Isaac and a further co-offender, Vaga, in other importations, although the applicant insisted that at all times he believed he was importing diamonds.

8The applicant's trial was therefore conducted on the basis that he was not aware of a substantial risk that the substance secreted in the shoes was a border controlled drug. The jury having rejected that defence, her Honour sentenced the applicant on the basis that he was aware that there was a substantial risk. 

9The extension of some leniency to the applicant, pursuant to the decision in Ellis, therefore arose in somewhat unusual circumstances. The Crown accepted that at the time of the applicant's disclosure to the police, his involvement in the importations had not, and was not likely to come to the attention of the authorities.

The Findings and Remarks on Sentence

10The facts underpinning the sentence were the subject of formal admissions made for the purposes of the trial. There was no dispute in relation to the circumstances surrounding both importations. The only issue was the applicant's state of mind.

11Her Honour noted that the applicant's motive for committing the offences was financial, in that he was unemployed and was addicted to gambling. The applicant had no relevant prior convictions. He was 47 years of age at the time of sentence. He emigrated to Australia from Greece at the age of 20 where he secured employment as a spray painter in a car manufacturing firm and later worked in the construction industry. The applicant's subjective circumstances were canvassed in detail.

12Her Honour comprehensively addressed s 16A of the Crimes Act (Cth). Her Honour began by noting that the judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 suggested that ""deterrence is to be given chief weight in the sentencing task and that stern punishment will be warranted in almost every case"". 

13The judge accepted the Crown's submission that the applicant acted as an intermediary between Mr Isaac and Mr Hanna and therefore recruited, encouraged and assisted Mr Hanna to do those things necessary for the importation of a significant quantity of heroin. The judge also accepted the applicant's submission that everything that the applicant did was at the behest of and funded by Mr Isaac.

14Her Honour found that the applicant performed the role of courier with respect to count one, although that did not entitle him to any degree of leniency. Her Honour found that the applicant's criminality was significantly aggravated over and above that usually attributed to a drug courier by the fact that the applicant, on both occasions, travelled overseas for the purpose of importing drugs or aiding and abetting another person to do so.

15Turning to the question of the applicant's co-operation with law enforcement agencies, her Honour referred to the applicant's voluntary admission of his involvement in the importations and the applicant's undertaking to give evidence on behalf of the Crown in the prosecutions of Mr Vaga and Mr Hanna. Her Honour noted that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) accepted that the applicant's assistance led to the arrest and prosecution of Mr Isaac and Mr Vaga. The AFP also accepted that the applicant had been fully cooperative and had communicated regularly with them and that the applicant had placed himself at risk of physical harm by providing assistance.

16In the light of this information, her Honour determined that the applicant's assistance was of more than medium value to the AFP. Her Honour also noted that the applicant had been subject to verbal and physical abuse by inmates as a result of the issue of a subpoena by the DPP in relation to the applicant's proposed evidence in the trial of Mr Isaac. At the time of sentence, the applicant had been in protection and had limited access to facilities provided generally to other inmates of the prison. In summary, her Honour found that the applicant's assistance was ""significant, useful, complete and reliable"", and that it was ""timely and extensive"". The judge accepted that the applicant's time in custody had been onerous and that it would continue to be so.

17In the result, her Honour allowed a discount of 15% for the applicant's past assistance and 10% for the applicant's future assistance.

18Next, her Honour dealt with the question of the applicant's voluntary disclosure of his conduct. Consistent with the authorities, her Honour determined to reduce the sentences that would have otherwise been imposed, without stipulating a defined discount : see R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102.

19The requirements under s 16A to take into account the deterrent effect of the sentence to be imposed and the need for adequate punishment were noted by the judge. 

20Finally, her Honour accepted the submission made by the applicant's counsel that the head sentences for offences of the type committed by the applicant tended to be in the range of 6 to 10 years. The sentence for count one accordingly fell marginally below that range whilst the sentence for count two fell marginally above the lower limit. 

Grounds 1 and 2 : the Ellis Factor and Contrition.

21In Raad v R [2011] NSWCCA 138 at [20] Adams J said :-
It is important, in my respectful opinion, to bear in mind that (what might conveniently be called) an Ellis situation gives rise to two distinct matters that need to be taken into account. First, it informs the assessment of remorse and contrition and reduces, potentially to insignificance, the requirement for personal deterrence. It seems to me it also reduces the materiality of general deterrence, since it would be directed to that miniscule class of individuals minded to commit crimes and then admit to them. At the same time, the notions of retribution and denunciation are undoubtedly still of considerable importance. But they are only a part of the answer to the question; ""What does this particular offender deserve?"" and are necessarily affected, whether favourably or adversely to the offender, by the whole of the circumstances including - as is typical of the Ellis cases - the marked change in the character and personal attributes of the person being sentenced as distinct from the way that person was when the crime was committed. This is no more than noting the incommensurable character of the factors forming the instinctive synthesis which is ultimately expressed in the sentence. These considerations may be usefully termed the "" Ellis personal features"". (italics not in original)


22The applicant's counsel places particular emphasis upon the italicised portion of these observations in order to demonstrate that Flannery SC DCJ erred in attributing ""chief weight"" to general deterrence when sentencing the applicant. It is accepted that her Honour found that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was not a vehicle for specific deterrence.

23There are three fundamental problems with this submission.

24First, her Honour's reference to that part of the judgment in Wong set out at [12] above does no more than recognise (as her Honour was obliged to do) the High Court's authoritative statements in the area of sentencing for Commonwealth drug offences. It does not support the submission that her Honour placed undue weight on general deterrence.

25Second, Adams J's observations in Raad were not endorsed by McClellan CJ at CL or Buddin J, both of whom differed from Adams J on the appeal. With respect to Adams J, the italicised remarks seem to misapprehend the principle of general deterrence. One of the purposes of punishment is to signal to others who might be disposed to commit offences of a like kind that severe penalties will be imposed : R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 598. The role of general deterrence is not confined to those who, like the applicant, commit an offence and then partially disclose their criminality.

26Third, Adams J recognises that the Ellis principle is typically engaged where there has been a ""marked change in the character and personal attributes of the person being sentenced as distinct from the way that person was when the crime was committed."" The applicant has undergone no such transformation. He told the police he thought he was importing diamonds and he maintained that stance (as he was entitled to do) at trial. He continued to protest his innocence at sentence. This ""unusual"" feature of the case reinforced the importance of general deterrence in the sentencing exercise, rather than diminished it.

27The applicant's insistence that he was wrongly convicted sits uneasily with the submission that further error is demonstrated by the failure to find contrition, either inherent in the applicant's decision to disclose the importations to the police, or independently of that conduct. The applicant disclosed to police the arrangements to import a substance which the applicant believed to be diamonds. He may have regretted his involvement, given the turn of events, but he never acknowledged responsibility or remorse for his part in importing heroin. Once he was convicted of that offence, there was no scope for a finding of remorse or contrition. 

28Both of these grounds fail.

Ground 3 : Manifest Excess

29There is no substance to this ground. As the applicant's counsel frankly acknowledged on the hearing of the appeal, the individual sentences are at the very bottom of the range that no doubt includes cases where a discount for assistance has been given, or where an early plea of guilty has attracted a discount of 25%, equal to the discount for assistance applied in the applicant's case. There was no complaint (nor could there be) about the extent of accumulation.

		09 August 2012",2012-07-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759675,Nguyen v R [2012] NSWCCA 152,"JUDGMEnt
1HOEBEN JA:  Offence and sentenceOn 11 August 2010 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence contrary to s 400.3(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) of dealing with $1 million or more, being reckless to the risk that the money will become an instrument of crime.  The applicant was committed for sentence in the District Court.  The maximum penalty for the offence is 12 years imprisonment and/or a fine not exceeding $79,200.
2On 4 March 2011 his Honour Judge King SC sentenced the applicant to a total term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.  The sentence was backdated to commence on 16 March 2010, to take account of pre-sentence custody that was solely referable to the subject offence.  The applicant's non-parole period expires on 15 September 2014.
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal against this sentence upon a single ground of appeal - that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  The applicant originally argued that five aspects of the sentencing remarks involved discrete error.  At the hearing of this matter, the applicant advised that she no longer relied upon paragraph (c).
4The four remaining areas of alleged error were as follows:
The sentencing judge
(a) erred in relation to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
(b) erred in relation to taking into account any suspicion as to the source of the funds and the attendant risk the money would be used as an instrument of crime.
(d) erred in relation to the assessment of the covert nature of the offence in the context of her other legitimate dealings.
(e) erred in failing to have proper regard to the subjective circumstances of the applicant.
These asserted errors were not the subject of individual grounds of appeal, but were relied upon to support the ground of appeal of manifest excess.
Background
5The factual basis for the sentence was derived from a lengthy Statement of Facts (126 paragraphs).  The applicant accepted the contents of the Statement of Facts without objection.  His Honour effectively incorporated the Statement of Facts into his sentencing remarks.  They are to be found at pp 1 - 35 of his Remarks on Sentence.
6The Statement of Facts established that the applicant dealt with substantial amounts of cash on six discrete occasions, in the period between 24 February and 16 March 2010 (23 days).  The cash amounts dealt with on each of the six occasions were as follows:
First transaction - 24 February 2010 - $2,500,000.
Second transaction - 27 February 2010 - $1,300,000.
Third transaction - 28 February 2010 - $1,800,000.
Fourth transaction - 1 March 2010 - $1,800,000.
Fifth transaction - 8 March 2010 - $1,400,000.
Sixth transaction - 16 March 2010 - $1,100,000.
The total amount dealt with by the applicant was $9.9 million.
7The offence in the indictment related to this total course of conduct, notwithstanding that each of the six discrete episodes could have been made the subject of an individual charge under s 400.3(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).
8On each of the six occasions the applicant dealt primarily with one or both of two individuals, Huong Ly Duong (Ly) and Khac Cuong Duong (Cuong) prior to delivery of the cash.  The applicant at times communicated with Ly and Cuong using mobile telephone services subscribed in the names of innocent third parties and changed mobile phones regularly during the relevant period.  She communicated in coded language, designed to conceal the large amounts being collected and dealt with.   The applicant's role included counting the cash amounts.  On each occasion, she then participated in a subsequent dealing or dealings with the cash, which included depositing funds into a nominated bank account, or disposing of the funds to nominated individuals.  On at least one occasion, the applicant was required to maintain possession of large amounts of cash until it could be safely disposed of.
9The applicant participated in this conduct while acting as the Sydney representative of a Melbourne based remittance agency.  In March 2009 the applicant had entered into an agreement with Xuan Nhuong Nguyen (Xuan) to act as the Sydney based representative for Xuan Nhuong Pty Limited, a Melbourne based provider of alternative remittance services registered with Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac).  Pursuant to that arrangement, when relevant circumstances arose, she advised other syndicate members to take measures designed to avoid unwanted attention, such as dealing in smaller amounts on multiple occasions or depositing cash in different banks or at different branches.  The applicant also participated in a system of ""off the book"" record keeping, which involved faxed confirmation of orders and disposal of funds on plain paper and the avoidance of receipt book entry keeping.
10The applicant was remunerated through commission payments that were admitted to range from 0.7 percent to 2.7 percent of the amounts dealt with.  It was admitted that $40,000 in cash found in the applicant's home during a police search was derived from the applicant's commission from a number of transactions.
11The applicant was arrested on 16 March 2010 and remained in custody until she was sentenced.  After her arrest, she participated in a record of interview in which she denied ever having been to Cuong's premises, giving a person named 'Jennifer' any money that day and said that the largest amount she had ever been given was $36,500.  On 28 July 2010 and 4 August 2010, subsequent to the bulk of the brief being served, the applicant participated in two records of interview with the AFP.  During those interviews, the applicant outlined her involvement in the remitting syndicate and her dealings with Cuong, Ly and Xuan.  The applicant further detailed her role as the ""representative"" of Xuan Nhuong Pty Limited.
12As the ""representative"" of Xuan Nhuong Pty Limited, the applicant would take possession of quantities of cash which would be transferred to recipients in Australia, Vietnam and other countries.  The applicant would then fax confirmation of the order to Xuan Nhuong Pty Limited using a receipt book provided by Xuan, before banking that cash into designated bank accounts or handing possession of that money to other representatives of Xuan Nhuong Pty Limited.  The applicant acted as the ""representative"" of Xuan Nhuong Pty Limited from her home premises in Marrickville, NSW and from the business premises of the VN International Travel Agency, located in Illawarra Road, Marrickville.
13In that record of interview, the applicant stated that she never inquired of Cuong as to the source of the money.  She told him Xuan's instructions were that she could not accept anything if she knew that the money involved drugs or was for the purpose of weapons, or anything to do with terrorism.  Cuong told her they were old customers of his and not involved in anything like that.
14In this record of interview, the applicant initially stated that Xuan told her those doing business wanted to avoid the Tax Office and they did take them on, but not to take on those dealing with drugs.  When asked further questions about this, the applicant recanted this information to an extent and said Xuan never told her this directly.  In her record of interview conducted 4 August 2010 the applicant stated that she did not understand how Xuan operated his business.
Proceedings before King SC DCJ
15King SC DCJ made the following findings and observations in respect of the objective circumstances of the offence.
(a) The offence was a ""very serious example of its type"".
(b) The applicant was an ""active participant"" in an illegal enterprise who was involved in ""aspects of the planning, counting and organising"" of money transfers.
(c) The applicant was a ""trusted member"" of the scheme, acting with ""some autonomy"".
(d) The applicant performed ""an essential role"" in the disposal of the money.
(e) The offence reflected a ""serious ongoing course of criminal conduct"" as distinct from ""a one off error of judgment"".
(f) The applicant engaged in the conduct ""for financial reward"" that was ""substantial"".
(g) The applicant's participation in the offence was ""motivated by greed"".
(h) Over a period of 23 days, the applicant received $9.9 million which was almost ten times the threshold amount prescribed by the offence provision.
(i) The offending ceased on 16 March 2010 with the applicant's arrest, although his Honour expressly declined to draw any inference that the offending would have continued after that date.
(j) The applicant's use of a mobile telephone number, subscribed in the name of another, communicating in cryptic or coded language and keeping limited written documentation were examples of ""a course of conduct designed to conceal the offending behaviour from any investigating authorities"".
(k) The combination of these matters pointed to ""objectively a very serious offence"".
(l) The ""offence itself was part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of acts, each of similar conduct, each in excess of the threshold of $1 million"".
16His Honour made the following findings and observations in relation to the applicant's subjective circumstances.
(a) At the time of sentence, the applicant was a 53 year old widow with a number of adult children.
(b) The applicant emigrated from Vietnam in 1978 to New Zealand, spending two years on route in a refugee camp in Malaysia.
(c) The applicant migrated to Australia in about 1985 with her husband and children.
(d) The applicant was a hard worker who sent money to Vietnam to assist relatives and the impoverished.
(e) The applicant established a number of businesses with her late husband.  At the time of the offence, she was running a travel agency business.
(f) The applicant cared for her husband during a six year period of terminal illness, until his death in about 2003.
(g) The applicant enjoyed strong family support.
(h) The applicant was entitled to be regarded as a person of prior good character, who had made ""regular and significant contributions"" through charitable and voluntary work to community and church organisations.
(i) The applicant made a ""genuine"" offer of assistance to the authorities, which, despite being of ""no value"" (on account of the depth of evidence collected by investigators), it was nevertheless ""relevant to the question of remorse and contrition"" and would have a modest effect on the sentence.
(j) Although the discount for the plea of guilty was not quantified, the applicant's early plea resulted in an entitlement to ""a significant discount within the appropriate range, but also allowing that the plea to some degree was motivated by a recognition of the inevitable"".
(k) The applicant demonstrated genuine remorse for the offence and had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
(l) During her husband's illness, and after his death, the applicant continued running the business and looking after the children, together with some help from relatives.  The applicant continued working in the travel agency until the time of her arrest.
17The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, but evidence was given by her younger brother, Hai Ngoc Dao.  His Honour's favourable findings in relation to the applicant's subjective case were based on his evidence.
18The applicant had been very active in the Catholic Church in both Australia and in Vietnam.  A number of references were provided by Catholic Priests, both in Australia and in Vietnam.  Amongst her charitable works, had been assistance provided to many poor students by supporting them so they could have the opportunity to finish their studies.
19Despite the applicant's strong subjective case, his Honour held that general deterrence was ""a significant factor"" to be taken into account in the sentencing exercise, having regard to the difficulty of detecting an offence of this nature, particularly in circumstances ""where the offender's reputation of honesty in the community and not having committed any offences is ... a factor relied on by the syndicate as part of the endeavour to avoid detection"".
20His Honour found that the applicant was an active participant in an enterprise which had both a legitimate purpose of money transfer and an illegal purpose of moving cash funds into and/or out of Australia.  He found that the applicant deliberately took no details of the person supplying the money and kept no official records of the transaction, despite knowing that she was required to do so and in fact doing so in respect of legitimate funds.  He found that clearly suspecting that there was a suspicious source of the money, the applicant chose not to make any inquiries and to simply proceed to deal with the money, being reckless to the risk that the money would become an instrument of crime.  His Honour said:
""The court accepts that in relation to an offence of this nature, particularly taking into account the difficulty of detection and bringing offenders to justice, in circumstances where the offender's reputation of honesty in the community and not having committed any previous offences is in fact a factor relied on by the syndicate as part of the endeavour to avoid detection.  In those circumstances, general deterrence is a significant factor to be taken into account.
The sentence imposed must be of such a severity that it will act to deter others minded to engage in such conduct and signal to them that the potential financial rewards to be gained from such activities will be neutralised by the risk of severe punishment.""  (ROS 46.5 - .8)
Ground of appeal and submissionsGround of Appeal - The sentencing judge erred in imposing a non-parole period and overall term that were manifestly excessive.
(a) Error in relation to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
21The applicant submitted that her offending should have been assessed as falling towards the lower end of the scale.  This was because it was clear from the Statement of Facts that whereas the applicant may have had some suspicions as to the source of the cash, there was no evidence that the cash was likely to be used for a criminal purpose.  On the contrary, in most cases the cash was paid into a bank account. 
22The Court's attention was drawn to the telephone intercepts relating to the first transaction on 24 February 2010.  The applicant submitted that it was clear from that telephone intercept that she was very naive in relation to the use of the code and was clearly very surprised when she learned how much money was involved (ROS 3.7).
23The interpretation which the applicant wished the Court to make of the initial telephone intercept of the conversation between her and Ly, was a somewhat benign one.  I am prepared to infer that the applicant was relatively inexperienced in dealing with such a large sum of money, but otherwise the telephone intercept indicates a clear willingness on the part of the applicant to participate in the illegal transaction.
24His Honour's finding that the offence was objectively ""very serious"", was well open on the evidence.  Significantly, the applicant's counsel in the sentence proceedings conceded that the offence was serious and that a significant sentence was warranted.
25The combination of the following circumstances provided a more than adequate factual basis for his Honour's conclusion that the applicant's offence was a ""very serious example of its type"".The very large amounts of cash involved.
The serial nature of the offending.
The applicant's ""essential role"" in the enterprise.
The applicant's efforts to conceal her conduct and the conduct of others involved in the syndicate.
The applicant's motivation of greed.
26No error in his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the circumstances of the offending has been made out.
(b) Error in taking into account suspicion as to the source of the funds and the risk the money would be used as an instrument of crime.
27The applicant submitted that the offence under s 400.3(2)(b) of which she was convicted, contemplated recklessness as to the funds being used as an instrument of crime.  The applicant submitted that in relation to the risk that the funds would be used as an instrument of crime, there was no evidence to that effect.  The applicant submitted that it was not open to his Honour to use his assessment of the ""suspicious"" nature of the source of the funds to inform his assessment of the level of recklessness on her part in relation to the risk of the money becoming an instrument of crime.
28The applicant submitted that on many occasions the money was deposited into a bank.  This was an unusual step to take if there was a high level of recklessness on her part as to the risk of the money becoming an instrument of crime.  The applicant submitted that the amount of money did not of itself inform the assessment of how reckless she was in relation to the risk that the money would become an instrument of crime. 
29The applicant relied upon the following extract from Regina v Narongchai Saengsai-Or [2004] NSWCCA 108; 147 A Crim R 172 where Bell J said:
""70 Recklessness with respect to a circumstance under the Criminal Code invites consideration of (i) the accused's awareness of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists, and (ii) having regard to the known circumstances whether it was unjustifiable to take the risk. The latter consideration does not involve a question of fact. It requires that the jury make a moral or value judgment concerning the accused's advertent disregard of the risk.""
30In summary, the applicant submitted, that a proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was that ""the accused's awareness of a substantial risk"" and ""the accused's advertent disregard of the risk"" in this case was towards the lower end of the scale.
31In the course of submissions in this Court, the applicant conceded that there was a logical connection between the before and after risks associated with the receipt of large sums of cash where not only was no explanation given as to its source, but the whole transaction was dealt with in such a way that proper record keeping was not maintained.  In those circumstances, suspicion as to the source of the money was capable of informing the concept of recklessness as to the money's ultimate destination and use.  Such a suspicion about the source of the funds can still be relevant to establish recklessness as to the fact that there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime.
32The comment by his Honour, upon which this challenge is based, needs to be read in context.
""The offender performed an essential role in the disposal of the money.  She deliberately took no details of the person supplying the money, and kept no official records of the transaction, despite knowing that she was required to do so, and in fact doing so in respect of legitimate funds.  Clearly suspecting that there was a suspicious source of the money, she chose not to make any inquiries and to simply proceed with dealing with money, being reckless to the risk that the money would become an instrument of crime.""  (ROS 41.7)
33Properly understood in context, that comment was a reference to a factual detail that was apt to explain why the applicant ""chose not to make any inquiries"".  In making this observation, his Honour did not form his own assessment of the ""suspicious nature"" of the source of the funds.  Rather, his Honour was giving just another example of conduct engaged in by the applicant that made her suitable for the ""essential role"" she played in the criminal enterprise - conduct which included deliberately not taking details of the cash supplier, or keeping official records.
34Nor did his Honour err by noting that the applicant elected to ""simply proceed with dealing with the money, being reckless to the risk that the money would become an instrument of crime"".  Those words were a shorthand description of the culpable conduct engaged in by the applicant, in respect of which the applicant played an ""essential role"".  There is simply no basis in the text for the assumption that an assessment of the ""suspicious"" source of the funds (which was not in fact made) informed a further assessment of the level of recklessness.
35In the circumstances of this case, his Honour was entitled to find that the suspicions on the part of the applicant resulting from the extraordinary amounts of cash being delivered on a regular and frequent basis, were relevant to her appreciation of the substantial and unjustifiable risk that the money would become an instrument of crime.  This is particularly so in circumstances where the applicant was being asked to engage in (and did engage in) clandestine conduct.  The reference in the Statement of Facts to possible tax avoidance is consistent with that scenario.
36The evidence of clandestine activity by the applicant (i.e. the use of coded language, frequently changing phones, not keeping proper records, giving in excess of $1 million in cash to a courier to drive the money interstate etc) supports a strong inference of recklessness of the particularised kind on the applicant's part.  It was also noted that the element of recklessness which the applicant accepted by her plea, necessarily incorporated the features of substantial and unjustifiable risk taking.
37It follows that this challenge to his Honour's analysis of the offence has not been made out.
(d) Error in relation to the assessment of the covert nature of the offence in the context of the applicant's other legitimate business dealings.
38In reviewing the facts, specific reference was made by his Honour to faxes written in the Vietnamese language, as well as ""cryptic"" or ""coded"" language.  The applicant submitted that to the extent that his Honour had regard to the use of the Vietnamese language as part of the deception, his Honour was in error.  The applicant submitted that she could hardly be criticised for using her first language to communicate with another person of Vietnamese heritage.  
39In relation to the ""code"", the applicant submitted that it could not be regarded as particularly sophisticated which placed it more towards the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness.
40The applicant was critical of the following observation by his Honour:
""There is no evidence as to exactly how much the offender received by way of commission, with the exception of the reference to $40,000.  However, it is clear that at least in respect of the transactions that totalled in money received from others $9.8 million, that it can be anticipated that the personal reward was a substantial one.  She was otherwise conducting legitimate businesses, or at least a business.""  (ROS 42.5)
41The applicant submitted that this observation was open to the inference that the sentencing judge had formed the view that the applicant was either not otherwise genuinely conducting a business, or that the legitimate business interests were constructed so as to provide ""cover"" for the ""money laundering"".  The applicant submitted that there was no basis for any impeachment of her legitimate business interests as having an illegal purpose, or one related to the offending conduct.  She submitted that if such were his Honour's purpose:
(a) It was inconsistent with the evidence.  The applicant's brother, Mr Dao, gave a detailed account of the applicant's long history of a productive working life looking after her children and her husband.
(b) It was not open to him to use this observation as relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence, or as part of his findings which affected the sentence.  If he did so, he should have stated his finding clearly so that it could be properly assessed.
42The applicant submitted that in relation to her ""covert activities"", his Honour failed to adequately take into account the public nature of the relationship between her and ""Xuan"" in Melbourne.  As the agreed facts noted, there was a written agreement between them and a commission was specified.  The advertisement for agents by Xuan was quite open and was clearly set out in a Vietnamese community newspaper.
43The applicant's criticism of his Honour's finding that her use of the Vietnamese language in communications was part of conduct designed to conceal the offence is made out.  Vietnamese was the applicant's first language and there was nothing sinister in her using that language when speaking with other persons of Vietnamese origin.  It is, however, a criticism which goes nowhere.
44Even without that finding, there was ample evidence of a conscious course of deception by the applicant in respect of this offence.  Coded language was used.  Mobile telephones subscribed in another person's name were used.  Faxes without letterhead were sent by her to her Melbourne principal.  The illegal transactions were not recorded in the books of account of her legitimate business.  All these matters were relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
45There is, however, no substance in the applicants other submissions under this heading.  When read in context, his Honour was not impugning the legitimacy of the applicant's business.  His Honour expressly accepted that the applicant was a hardworking person who had successfully run businesses before becoming involved in this offence and had continued to run a legitimate business at the time when the offence was being committed.
46The point which his Honour made was that one of the reasons why the applicant was used by the syndicate to engage in money laundering was because she was conducting a legitimate business which would serve to camouflage her illegal activity.
47It was in that context that his Honour had regard to the ""public nature"" of the agency arrangement between the applicant and Xuan.  It was well open to his Honour to reason that the syndicate's deliberate use of the applicant's ""reputation of honesty in the community"" which included her legitimate business activities was intended to avoid detection.  This, of course, was one of the factors which his Honour had to take into account when considering general deterrence.
48This area of complaint has not been made out.
(e) Error in failing to have proper regard to the applicant's subjective circumstances.
49The applicant submitted that she had a very strong subjective case.  She submitted that his Honour had not had proper regard to her subjective case, otherwise he would not have imposed such a heavy sentence.  The matters which she stressed were the absence of prior convictions, her difficult personal circumstances before arriving in Australia, her care for her husband and children, and her charitable works for the community and her church.  Although his Honour specifically found that she was remorseful and contrite, because of what she had said to her brother Dao, and because of her offers of assistance to the police, that finding was not reflected in the sentence.
50It cannot be said that his Honour failed to have proper regard for the applicant's subjective case.  His Honour set out that case in considerable detail (ROS 36-39) and made findings favourable to the applicant.  Accordingly, his Honour was fully aware of the strength of her subjective case.  The relationship between an offender's subjective case and the sentence ultimately passed, is quintessentially a matter of discretion.  No error of the House v King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 kind has been made out.  All that can be said is that the applicant believes that there is a disconnect between her subjective case and the sentence which was imposed.  Such a belief and assertion are not indicative of error.
51The exercise of the sentencing discretion by his Honour required that he weigh these matters against the need for general deterrence and the serious objective circumstances of the offence.  The approach adopted by his Honour and the sentence which he imposed were open to him and were well and truly within proper discretionary limits.
52This area of complaint has not been made out.
Comparable sentences and statistics
53Although not raised as one of the four areas of complaint relied upon to establish that the sentence was manifestly excessive, the applicant placed before the Court some previous decisions involving offences contrary to s 400.3, with a view to indicating that the sentence imposed by his Honour was particularly severe.  In doing so, the applicant conceded that the number of cases (fourteen) was insufficient to establish any particular trend.
54The applicant did, however, refer the Court to the judgment of Barr AJ in R v Van Loi Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 226; 204 A Crim R 246 where his Honour identified various factors relevant to sentencing for offences of this kind.
""59 A court imposing sentence for an offence under subs .3(1) must have regard first to the maximum sentence applicable, to the minimum value of money or property necessary to bring an offence into the sub-section and to the prescribed state of mind, namely the offender's belief that the money or property was the proceeds of crime.  There will be other features, too, including the actual value of money or property dealt with and the proportion, if any, by which that value exceeds the minimum value qualifying for subs .3(1), as well as the period of time over which the transactions constituting the offence were carried out, the authority by which the offender carried out his part and precisely what the offender did and the manner in which the offender acted, which will include consideration of any practised deceit.  The nature of the criminal source of money or property may be important.  The Court will need to consider whether the money or property was beneficially the offender's or not and, if not, the value of any intended reward.  It will be important to consider what part of the money was successfully dealt with and the value of any resulting loss to the community.  The precise state of mind of the offender will be important.  Just as subss .3(1), .3(2) and .3(3) vary according to a scale of increasingly serious states of mind, rising from negligence to recklessness to belief, so there may be degrees of belief, rising to certain knowledge, as in Maldonado.  And there will be other considerations, case by case.""
55The applicant submitted that by reference to the factors identified by Barr AJ, it was apparent that the sentence imposed by his Honour was excessive and beyond the boundaries of a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion.  She submitted that while $9.9 million was an extremely large amount of money, that factor should not be allowed to dominate other relevant factors which needed to be taken into account.  She submitted that it was apparent from his Honour's judgment that he did regard the amount of money involved as the dominant factor in reaching the sentence which he did, even though he did not expressly say so.
56By reference to the factors identified by Barr AJ, the applicant submitted that it was clear that her offending was towards the lower end of the range.  The factors she particularly referred to were:
(i) The offence only took place over 23 days.
(ii) The money was primarily deposited into a bank, as distinct from being used in some self-evidently risky manner.
(iii) The 23 days of offending conduct were in the context of decades of law-abiding behaviour.
(iv) The business relationship with Xuan in Melbourne was not covert.
57Minds will differ as to how the factors identified by Barr AJ should be taken into account.  It is true that the offence took place over only 23 days.  On the other hand, the amount of money involved was very large indeed.  All of the transactions (six) involved large sums.  By pleading to the offence, the applicant accepted the element of recklessness as part of her state of mind.  That was appropriate, given the large amount of money involved and her deliberate eschewing of any inquiry as to the ultimate use and destination of the money.  The applicant's important part in the hierarchy of the syndicate and her motivation for the offending were all relevant.  Rather than assisting the applicant's submission, the analysis of relevant factors identified by Barr AJ simply emphasises how thorough was his Honour's review of the facts.  The factors referred to by Barr AJ were all factors which King DCJ took into account when arriving at the sentence.
58It should also be noted that R v Van Loi Nguyen involved offences of intention, rather than offences with a fault element of recklessness.  This gives only limited importance to the observations of Barr AJ as to the state of mind of the accused.  Accordingly, the comments of Barr AJ in that regard have to be modified to fit the circumstances of this case.
59In A Ansari v R, H Ansari v R  [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89 Simpson J said in relation to ""recklessness"" as used in this offence:
""34 ... The appellants' argument attributes recklessness to themselves, in the formation of, or entry into, the criminal agreement.  I accept that recklessness is insufficient for that.  But that is not the correct analysis.  It is not recklessness as to the agreement that is in question; it is the agreement (intentionally entered into) that an offence will be committed that might, inter alia, be done with a reckless state of mind.  The recklessness attaches, not to the formation of, or the entry into, the agreement, but to the offence that is to be committed pursuant to the agreement.""
60There is nothing in his Honour's analysis which is contrary to what was said by either Barr AJ or Simpson J in those cases.  On the contrary, his Honour's approach and analysis is fully consistent with those observations.  When regard is had to the actual conduct of the applicant, her essential role, the scale and serial nature of the offending and the applicable maximum penalty, the sentence imposed by his Honour was well within the exercise by him of a proper sentencing discretion and no error has been revealed.
Conclusion
61It follows that the applicant has failed to establish by reference to the alleged areas of error, either individually or collectively, that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  I am satisfied that the sentence was well within the appropriate range and that no lesser sentence is warranted in law.
62The orders which I propose are:(1) Leave to appeal is granted.
(2) The appeal is dismissed.
63LATHAM J:  I agree with Hoeben JA.
64GARLING J: I agree with Hoeben JA.

		18 July 2012",2012-07-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759676,GEH v R [2012] NSWCCA 150,"JUDGMENT

1BASTEN JA: In March 2011 the appellant was convicted by a jury on two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 16 years, who was under his authority at the time of the offence. The complainant was his stepdaughter. The charges related to two occasions, when the complainant was 15 years of age, the events occurring in April and October/November 1992 respectively. 

2On the appeal the appellant challenged the correctness in law of the exclusion by the trial judge of evidence which might have disclosed or implied sexual activity (or the lack thereof) on the part of the complainant on another occasion, some eight months later. The entitlement to proffer such evidence was said to arise by way of an exception to the general exclusionary rule contained in s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). I agree with Harrison J that the appeal should be dismissed.

3It is not necessary in these reasons to repeat the circumstances of the trial which are set out by Harrison J. The relevant parts of s 293 may be found at [33] below.

The impugned evidence
4The complainant gave evidence as to her relationship with her stepfather, who was living in the complainant's home by April 1992. Her evidence included the nature of the relationship in the period between the two offences and, relevantly for present purposes, following the second offence. Within approximately two weeks of the second offence, on 10 November 1992, the complainant had made a complaint of abuse to a teacher at her school. She was questioned by officers from the Department of Community Services and steps were taken to arrange for her to stay with a friend for a short period. She later returned to her home but left on 24 March 1993, after an argument with the appellant. She arranged to stay at the home of another friend, Amy Hastings, and Amy's father, Mr John Hastings. Ms Hastings was aware of the reason for the complainant not wishing to stay at her own home. The complainant said she left the Hastings household in October 1993 and returned to her home: Tcpt, 22/03/11, pp 31(30) and 47 (29). 

5Before cross-examining the complainant, counsel for the appellant raised in the absence of the jury his intention to cross-examine the complainant as to whether she had admitted to Ms Hastings, whilst staying at the Hastings home, that she was having an affair with Ms Hastings' father and that she was pregnant. That claim was based on a written account made by Ms Hastings dated 6 November 2011, part of the contents of which were put to the complainant in cross-examination on the voir dire. She denied making any such assertion. She was not asked whether at that time she was having an affair with Mr Hastings.

6Ms Hastings was also called on the voir dire and, consistently with her written account, gave evidence that the complainant had admitted to her that she was having an affair with Ms Hastings' father and that she was pregnant. Ms Hastings gave evidence that she moved out of home on 20 July 1993, following (she said ""days later"") her confrontation with the complainant over her claimed relationship with Ms Hastings' father: Tcpt, pp 63(45) and 64(30). (Aspects of the timing and consequence of this exchange departed from her written account.)

7The purpose of the proposed cross-examination was somewhat obscure. Following the evidence on the voir dire, the trial judge put to counsel for the accused that ""what you seek to establish at the trial is that [the complainant] was a sexual fantasist who was all too willing to make allegations against men, is that right?"": at Tcpt, p 65(30). Counsel denied that he would put to the complainant that she was a ""sexual fantasist"" but rather would put to her that ""when it suits her, if she's in conflict with a person, she will tell lies to hurt the other person"": p 65(40)-(45). The trial judge pressed on counsel that the ""forensic purpose is that the complainant lied about sexual experience with Mr Hastings"": p 65(47). Counsel stated that he was ""not going to put that she lied, I'm going to put that you will say these things when it suits you to hurt another person's feelings"".

8The purpose for which the evidence is proffered is not critical to the test of admissibility in s 293. However, the somewhat muted forensic purpose identified might have raised a question as to whether the accused would be entitled to call evidence from Ms Hastings to contradict the anticipated denial by the complainant of the conversation about her supposed relationship with Ms Hastings' father. As noted by Gleeson CJ in R v Morgan (1993) 30 NSWLR 543 at 544F, in considering the approach to be taken to the statutory provision, ""the evidence in question is, by hypothesis, relevant and of probative value (otherwise it would be inadmissible without the need for any statutory exclusion)"". See also HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2; 197 CLR 414 at [24] (Gleeson CJ). It may be accepted for present purposes that the evidence was both the suggestion to the complainant that she had told Ms Hastings that she (the complainant) had had sex with Mr Hastings, a statement which the complainant would deny making, and Ms Hastings' evidence affirming that it had occurred.

The exclusion - s 293(3)
9To determine admissibility, the first step is to consider whether that evidence disclosed or implied that the complainant had, or may have taken part in sexual activity (with Mr Hastings) or that she had not, or may not have, taken part in such activity. Because the evidence was limited to the making of the statement, it could hardly be said that it ""disclosed"" actual sexual activity. (Indeed, it appears to have been the intention of the accused to invite the jury to infer that the complainant was lying in denying she had made the statement to Ms Hastings and that the statement itself had been untrue when made.) However, a reasonable person might draw from the question and answer (so that the evidence could properly be said to imply) either the inference that the complainant had taken part in such activity, or the inference that she had not. The possibility that a reasonable person might draw neither inference would not remove the evidence from the prohibition, so long as at least one inference was open. Thus, it was rightly conceded on appeal that this evidence fell within the exclusion in s 293(3): see, in relation to the substantially identical provision which used to be s 409B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), R v White (1989) 18 NSWLR 332 (Gleeson CJ, Carruthers and Badgery-Parker JJ) at 340C-F; M (1993) 67 A Crim R 549 at 554-555 (Allen J, Gleeson CJ and Meagher JA agreeing).

An exception to the exclusion - s 293(4)
10In order to satisfy the condition of admissibility in sub-s (4)(a), the evidence must relate to sexual experience or sexual activity (or the lack of either) ""at or about the time of the commission of"" the offence alleged against the accused: s 293(4)(a)(i). Both the disputed statement to Ms Hastings and the possible relationship with her father must have occurred some 15 months after the events constituted by the first count on the indictment and eight months after the events the subject of the second count. They did not self-evidently satisfy the temporal element.

11The second and cumulative requirement of s 293(4) is that the relevant ""event"", which must be taken to include a non-event, must form part of ""a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed"" (emphasis added). The focus of the requirement is the circumstances in which the alleged offence was committed. However broadly one identifies that concept, it defies the ordinary meaning of the words to suggest that an assertion to a school friend about another matter months later constituted part of the circumstances of either assault alleged against the accused. In this regard, the difference between eight months and 15 months is of little significance.

12A number of common characteristics do not render two events which occurred eight months apart to be a connected set of circumstances. On the hypothesis that neither event occurred, the characteristics only obtain significance if it were shown that on the latter occasion she lied, which was not proposed to be done. Nor, accepting that the temporal element involves a degree of imprecision, can the events be described as being at ""about"" the same time. 

13Although the two limbs of the exception in paragraph (a) are differently worded and are cumulative, it may in some circumstances be helpful to read the temporal element (""at or about the time of"") and the relationship element (""form part of a connected set of circumstances"") together. Each phrase reflects elements of the other, particularly if the broader temporal element ""about the time of"" is the critical element. So much was implicit in the submissions for the appellant, which sought to identify certain characteristics (claim to be involved in a sexual relationship with a mature man in loco parentis in her home environment) said to be common to the elements of the alleged offence against the appellant and the inference to be drawn from the disputed assertion with respect to Mr Hastings. Although counsel for the accused was ambivalent as to whether the proffered evidence indicated a tendency to lie about such matters, the evidence could hardly have assisted the accused if that were not the forensic purpose. 

14It is not necessary for present purposes to consider what is encompassed by the phrases ""sexual experience"" and ""lack of sexual experience"", as compared to sexual activities or lack thereof. An event which occurred (or did not occur) several months after the alleged offences could not properly be understood as within the sexual experience of the complainant at the time of either offence. However, it may be doubted that the reference to ""experience"" was intended to encompass a state of understanding, rather than a form of activity, possibly seeking to distinguish the passive from the active role. That is because in the prohibition in sub-s (3)(a), the sexual experience is something that the complainant had or may have had, and in the second limb of the exception in sub-s (4)(a)(ii), it is necessary that the evidence be ""of events"", suggesting specific events or specific experiences.

15The trial judge was required to make an evaluative finding as to whether the temporal and relationship elements were satisfied. The decision to exclude the evidence was correct.

Further matters
16Two further things should be noted. First, contrary to the assertion of the appellant, the ground of the appeal, being a challenge to an evaluative judgment, was not a ground involving ""a question of law alone"" for the purposes of s 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Leave was therefore required but was not sought. Nevertheless, if leave had been sought, it would properly have been granted. Accordingly, no objection having been taken, it is sufficient to dismiss the appeal.

17Secondly, had there been an error in the approach adopted by the trial judge in rejecting the evidence as not falling within the exclusion in paragraph (a) in s 293(4), I would nevertheless have been inclined to dismiss the appeal on the ground that no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred: Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1), proviso. If the trial judge had formed a different view in respect of paragraph (a), it would then have been necessary to consider the overriding condition, applicable to all the exceptions in sub-s (4), namely that ""the probative value of the evidence"" must outweigh ""any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission"". 

18Although a question about the making of a statement possibly implying sexual activity may not in itself be a factor likely to cause significant distress, humiliation or embarrassment, the intention was to put the statement before the jury in circumstances where the complainant would have no opportunity to deny the underlying imputation, nor to explain the nature of her relationship with Ms Hastings, which might have given rise to a false allegation. Its capacity to cause distress could not have been ignored. On the other side of the balance, the alleged statement in respect of Mr Hastings could have had virtually no probative value. Apart from a handful of superficial similarities, the disparate circumstances in which the statements were made, one being to a school friend, the other to persons in authority, the extensive evidential detail relating to the claims against the appellant, as compared with the total absence of any investigation of the alleged statement about Mr Hastings, would have rendered the latter largely insignificant, assuming that the jury accepted that some such statement had been made and her denial disbelieved.

19However, to make good the proposition that the proviso is satisfied would require consideration of the whole of the evidence at the trial, which extended over three days. Because the question is hypothetical, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to carry out that exercise in these reasons.

20As indicated above, the appeal should be dismissed.

21HARRISON J: The appellant was found guilty on 24 March 2011 of two counts of having sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of 10 and 16 years whilst that person was under his authority. The offences were alleged to have occurred in 1992. The victim of the offences was the appellant's stepdaughter KN. The appellant was subsequently convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.

22The appellant appeals against his conviction on the single ground that the trial judge wrongly excluded certain evidence pursuant to s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act. For the reasons that follow, I consider that the evidence was properly excluded and that the appeal should be dismissed.

Background facts

23The Crown case had two main strands. The first strand was based upon the evidence of the complainant KN. She was aged 15 years at the time of the offences. She was in her early-thirties by the time of the trial. However, KN had complained about the offences many years before, on 10 November 1992, to one of her teachers at school. The Crown led evidence of other acts not in the indictment said to have been committed by the appellant against KN as well as evidence of various complaints made by her both in 1992 and in the years that followed. There was no objection taken by the appellant to this evidence.

24The second main strand was based upon the contents of intercepted telephone conversations between KN and the appellant. The appellant objected to the reception of that evidence but it was admitted. The appellant does not complain in this appeal about the reception of that evidence at the trial. The Crown contended that the appellant made admissions of sexual contact with KN in those conversations. This was disputed by the appellant.

25In his case the appellant called two witnesses to dispute certain aspects of the circumstances surrounding those upon which the complainant had been cross-examined. The appellant raised good character in his defence upon the basis that he had no criminal record. He did not give evidence. He did not take part in a police interview.

26As part of the Crown case KN gave evidence that on the first occasion upon which the appellant sexually assaulted her she referred to other sexual activity on her part. That evidence was as follows:

""Q You walk into the annexe, you've seen your stepfather naked with the erection, he's looking at you, what's the next thing you recall?

A. The next thing I recall is my stepfather saying to me, 'I have read your diary'. He then said to me, 'I know you had sex with the boy you met at the beach last summer and now that you've had it once you will need it again and more often'.

Q. Did he say anything else?

A. He also said that I could get it from him. My reply to him was, 'No, I'll be right'. I was scared, I didn't know what to do.

...

Q. What's the next thing that [the appellant] said?

A. The next thing that my stepfather [the appellant] said to me was that he had read my diary and he understood that I had sex with a boy I had met at the beach last summer and that if I did not have sex with him or did what he wanted me to do, he would tell the police about me and this other boy and that he would go to gaol and I would get into trouble as well because he had sex with somebody under the age of 16.

...

Q. Did you have a diary in April of 1992?

A. Yes I did.

Q. Did your diary contain an entry in relation to having had sex with a boy?

A. Yes it did.

Q. And did that entry relate to having had sex with a boy the previous summer?

A. Yes it did.""

27That evidence was led without objection. No complaint is made about the reception of that evidence at the trial.

The voir dire

28KN later gave evidence that after she had complained about the ongoing sexual assaults by the appellant, she moved in with her school friend Amy Hastings and her father John Hastings. Before commencing cross-examination of KN, the appellant's solicitor raised ""a potential 293 issue"": see s 293(5). In short, the appellant wanted to lead evidence that KN had said to Amy Hastings that KN was in a relationship with John Hastings. The evidence of those claims having been made by KN would come from Amy Hastings.

29KN was then asked questions on a voir dire. That evidence was as follows:

""Q. I will read from the statement. 'She', that's you, 'was coming to school and saying that she was in a relationship with my dad'. At any stage, did you - at this time - did you go to school and say to anyone that you were in a relationship - that is the word I use, 'relationship' - with John Hastings?

A. Absolutely not.

Q. I'll continue to read on. 'I knew this wasn't true' - this is her speaking. 'I told my brother or my nan, knowing this would get back to my dad' - I am not asking you to comment on that but I want you to comment on this, 'Not long after I told them [KN] was kicked out of my dad's house'. Were you asked to leave the premises by John Hastings?

A. Not to my knowledge. Not that I can recall, no.

...

Q Do you recall why it was that you left John Hastings' house?

A. I was having difficulty at school. I was no longer friends with Amy and I wanted to move back home. It wasn't ideal but I had nowhere else to go.""

30Amy Hastings was called to give evidence on the voir dire. Her evidence in answer to his Honour's questions was as follows:

""Q. Now you've told me that [KN] started to tell people that she was having a relationship with your father?

A. Yes.

Q. Now firstly did she ever say that to you?

A. Yes.

Q. When?

A. It started at school and when I came back ...

Q. No, look, look, don't...

Q. The question was when and you know you have to distinguish between what she told you and what you heard on the grapevine at school?

A. What I heard, I went back to her and asked her specifically about those things.

Q. All right so you heard some rumours at school and you confronted [KN]?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did you say to her?

A. Apparently you've been sleeping with my dad and you're pregnant with...actually I didn't know she was pregnant. She said, 'Yes I am and I'm pregnant'. So that's how I found out and it was days later that I moved out.""

31Amy Hastings was also asked questions on the voir dire by the Crown as follows:

""Q When you had that conversation shortly before you moved out and she told you she was in a relationship with your father and pregnant, were you still friends?

A. No.

Q. Why not?

A. I think that was enough.

Q. But prior to her saying that to you?

A. Prior to it, yes we were. We were friends.

Q. Prior to that moment when she said that, you were friends, is that right?

A. Until I heard that at school, I went directly to her and asked her about it and that's pretty much what I got. I went home that day and asked my father to ask her to leave.""

32Argument on the admissibility of the evidence then followed.

Section 293

33The appellant's notice of the application to cross-examine KN was necessitated by the terms of s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The terms of that section are relevantly as follows:

""293 Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience 

(1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 

(2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible. 

(3) Evidence that discloses or implies: 

(a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or 

(b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, 

is inadmissible. 

(4) Subsection (3) does not apply: 

(a) if the evidence: 

(i) is of the complainant's sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and 

(ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed, 

(b)...

and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission.

(5) A witness must not be asked: 

(a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or 

(b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible. 

(6) If the court is satisfied: 

(a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period: 

(i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or 

(ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and 

(b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication, 
the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified. 

(7) ...""

The decision

34His Honour's reasons for rejecting the appellant's application to cross-examine KN on this material included the following:

""In evidence given on the voir dire by the complainant, the complainant denies making any allegation of having a relationship with Amy Hastings' father. The accused submits that the accused is not seeking to adduce this evidence as evidence of sexual experience, or sexual reputation, but merely seeking to adduce evidence that the complainant may have lied about having a relationship with an older man, a person who may have been in authority over her.

...


In my view, the proposed cross-examination does infringe the prohibition contained in s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The same issue arose in White (1989) 18 NSWLR 332, and also in M v R (1993) 67 A Crim R 549, the latter being a decision of Allen J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Meagher JA concurred. In that case the appellant had been convicted of a number of sexual offences against three young girls, including a girl identified as T. At the trial the appellant's counsel sought to elicit by cross-examination and by evidence-in-chief from other witnesses that during, or shortly after, the period during which the offences charged were alleged to have occurred, T claimed that male members of her own family, including her father, were having sexual intercourse [with her] and that these claims were untrue.

In that case it was contended that such evidence did not invoke the prohibition...because the questions were not directed to her sexual experience but to establishing that in respect of sexual matters she was, at the relevant time, a fantasiser.

The Court held that the proscription in [s 293(3)] was directed not only to sexual experience but to lack of sexual experience. It was directed not only to having taken part in sexual activity, but also to not having taken part in such activity. The Court held that it was immaterial that the forensic purpose of the proposed evidence was that T had lied about sexual experience with members of her own family. The evidence, if elicited, would have disclosed or implied that she had not participated in sexual activity, the subject of the lies. Accordingly, it fell within the proscription.

The Court also pointed out that [s 293] enacts a blanket prohibition and to that prohibition there are only the exceptions specified in subsection [(4)]...There is no judicial discretion arising from considerations of justice as perceived by the Court in any individual case to proceed on the basis that some further exception can be read into the section by implication.

As was pointed out in M, a similar question arose in White where the trial judge refused to permit a question to be put in cross-examination suggesting that prior to the incident of sexual intercourse with the accused, the complainant had said to the accused that her former boyfriend had broken off their relationship as a result of finding her in bed with another man. The Court in White went on to discuss what is meant by the words, 'discloses or implies', and it was pointed out that it does not mean 'proves' but merely raises a suggestion that the tribunal of fact could consider. In my view, this proposed cross-examination is caught by the provisions of s 293.

...

As to subsection 4(a), under subparagraph (i), the sexual experience or lack of it has to be 'at or about the time' of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence and under subparagraph (ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed. In my view neither of those things is made out.

The last count in the indictment is alleged to have occurred between 19 October 1992, and 10 November 1992, and the question of a relationship arising between the complainant and John Hastings could only arise on or after 24 March 1993, so there is no relevant temporal nexus, in my view, nor is it part of a connected set of circumstances which, for example, could refer to sexual intercourse with other people at or around the same time, in the same place, for example, what is often referred to as a 'gang bang'. For those reasons I refuse leave to the defence to cross-examine the complainant about the existence or lack of existence of any relationship between her and John Hastings.""

The authorities

35A review of the cases dealing with s 293 or one of its predecessors does not reveal any particularly instructive method for determining the questions thrown up by subparagraphs (4)(a)(i) and (4)(a)(ii). This is not because there are any fundamental disagreements about what the provisions mean, or any inconsistencies in the way they should be applied, but because the disparate facts in every case require novel assessments of what is meant by ""at or about the time"" in (4)(a)(i) and ""alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances"" in (4)(a)(ii). In this way, otherwise clear statements of principle need to be understood and constantly reassessed having regard to the factual matrix in the context of which they have been expressed.

36In R v Morgan, it was held that the complainant having consensual intercourse with her boyfriend an hour or two after allegedly being sexually assaulted by the appellant fell within the terms of the predecessor to s 293. Gleeson CJ said this at 544:

""The nature of the connection that will suffice is left at large by the statute, and the facts and circumstances of each individual case need to be considered. However, it is the subject matter of the legislation that will ordinarily provide the best guide to whether circumstances are relevantly connected. There will necessarily be a temporal relationship between the events in question and the alleged sexual offence; otherwise one would not get past s 409B(3)(a)(i). The relationship to which s 409B(3)(a)(ii) directs attention is circumstantial. The facts that could give rise to such a relationship are widely variable.

Since the evidence in question is, by hypothesis, relevant and of probative value (otherwise it would be inadmissible without the need for any statutory exclusion), no narrow approach should be taken to that part of the statutory provision which permits its reception. Here the activities mentioned above all formed aspects of a social occasion in which the appellant, the complainant, her boyfriend, and some others were involved, and the events of that occasion constituted the context in which the alleged offence was committed and against which the complainant's evidence might reasonably be evaluated.""

37At 551, Mahoney JA said this:

""What precisely subpar (ii) requires is by no means clear. The
subparagraph requires that the set of circumstances be ""connected"" but gives no indication of what is an acceptable connection. The offence and the subsequent intercourse are, of course, connected in that, under the general law, the latter could, in the sense to which I have referred, be probative that the offence did not take place. But it is doubtful whether that is the kind of connection to which par (a) refers. As I have said, the section is drafted upon the assumption that the evidence deemed ""inadmissible"" would otherwise be admissible. Putting aside admissibility on credit alone (a matter to which par (a) does not appear to be primarily directed) the existence of a connection based on probative value would presumably always exist.

Established principles of construction and of justice require that the court adopt a construction which favours the liberty of the accused. Section 409B may result in an accused person, male or female, being imprisoned where otherwise he or she would not be. To this I shall refer.""

38In R v M, the appellant sought to establish that the complainant was a ""sexual fantasist"". By way of contrast to the present case, counsel for the appellant in R v M conceded that the evidence did not fall within one of the exceptions contained in the equivalent of s 293(4). That concession was referred to by Allen J at 555 of the report as follows:

""There are the specified exceptions, set out in subs (3), to the application of the proscription. It was conceded on the appeal that none of those specific exceptions apply. That concession was properly made. Counsel for the appellant was forced, accordingly, into the difficult role of having to argue, in substance, that despite the specific exceptions there is to be read into subs (3), by implication, an additional exception to the effect that the proscription does not apply where the evidence relates to whether the complainant by the making of false accusations of sexual misconduct with her by a person or persons other than the accused has manifested such a tendency to fantasise as to sexual conduct as to make her evidence in respect of the sexual conduct of the accused towards her unreliable.""

39In R v Bernthaler (Unreported, NSWCCA, 17 December 1993), the appellant was alleged to have sexually assaulted his wife. She was cross-examined at trial to suggest that she had lied about being sexually assaulted as a child. Evidence to contradict her was not admitted by the trial judge. However, on appeal to this Court, the whole of the evidence was held to be inadmissible in accordance with the terms of the earlier section.

40In R v Warner (Unreported, NSWCCA, 7 May 1997), the trial judge rejected evidence that, a few weeks after being allegedly sexually assaulted by the appellant, the complainant went to live with him and resumed her sexual relationship with him. Gleeson CJ held that the evidence should have been admitted pursuant to the equivalent of s 293(4)(b).

41In HG v The Queen, the appellant sought to lead expert evidence that the complainant had not been sexually assaulted by the appellant but had been sexually assaulted by her deceased father. The High Court held that the evidence as to that issue did not fall within the equivalent exceptions to s 293(4)(b) and (4)(c).

42In R v Tubou [2001] NSWCCA 243, this Court held that evidence that the complainant had had consensual sexual intercourse with a person other than the accused 34 hours before the offence occurred was not an event which formed part of a connected set of circumstances in which the offence was committed. Heydon JA found the events to be ""entirely unconnected"" and related to ""entirely separate sets of circumstances"": at [72].

43In R v Villar; R v Zugecic [2004] NSWCCA 302, this Court held that evidence of the complainant allegedly having worked in a brothel and having asked, after the alleged offence, ""Am I going to be paid for this?"" was correctly excluded by the trial judge. An argument based on s 293(4)(a) was rejected. At [135] Grove J said this:

""[135] To whom it was alleged to have been said and in what circumstances was not detailed. It would appear that the matter was argued at trial ""on principle"". It was not suggested that Zugecic wished to advance a case that he believed that RB came to Mitrov's unit for prostitution. The scant information available fails to demonstrate tangible probative value in support of contention that RB consented to what was happening and the ground should be rejected.""

44In R v Rahme [2004] NSWCCA 233, the appellant was alleged to have forced the complainant to work in a brothel and detained her there. The appellant sought to lead evidence at the trial that the complainant had previously freely worked as a prostitute and in a brothel. The appellant contended that the equivalent of the s 293(4)(a) applied. Sully J would have admitted the evidence. He said this at [57] - [59]:

""[57] It is true that the rejected evidence does not stipulate in terms of months and years quite when it was that the supposed prior experience is supposed to have occurred. Nonetheless, bearing in mind that the complainant was aged 15 years in January 2001, it is unlikely to have been, in the nature of things, any great time before January 2001 that she had whatever prior experience was to be suggested to her in cross-examination, or proved against her by the affirmative evidence of the particular witnesses upon whom the defence relied in that connection. 

[58] As to the necessary connection required in terms of section 105(4)(a)(ii), it seems to me that there was a clearly discernible connected set of circumstances of the kind contemplated by the statute. It can be expressed as follows: 

(1) The complainant was besotted by a young American who was then located in the United States.

(2) She was determined to get to him in the United States.

(3) For that purpose she needed to earn quickly a lot of money.

(4) She was alive to the potential of earning a lot of money by prostituting herself.

(5) She was alive to the fact that her prospects of prostituting herself for quick financial reward were better in Sydney than in, for example, Newcastle.

(6) That she conceives, thereupon, the idea of actively pursuing such an opportunity in Sydney.

(7) That she did not do so as, so to speak, an innocent abroad; but she did so, rather, as somebody who knew very well who was who and what was what in the dark world of prostitution; and that she had that knowledge by reason of her own personal antecedent experience.

[59] That connected set of circumstances, if accepted by the jury, did not go only to the credit in a narrow and pedantic sense of the complainant herself. It went to the very heart of the facts in issue at the trial.""

45James J made observations in that case that included the following:

""[162] As regards the Newcastle evidence, the trial judge held that s 105(4)(a) did not apply, because the evidence of the complainant's sexual experience or sexual activity as a prostitute in the Newcastle area was not evidence of sexual experience or sexual activity taken part in by the complainant ""at or about the time"" of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offences.

...

[176] On the authority of R v Morgan counsel for the appellant submitted that this Court should adopt a liberal approach in interpreting and applying subpara (ii) of s 105(4)(a). It was further submitted that ""a connected set of circumstances"" can include, not only what the Crown alleges, but what the defence alleges to have been ""a connected set of circumstances"".

...

[186] With respect to the Newcastle evidence and s 105(4)(a), I have concluded that the trial judge's finding, that the evidence was not evidence of sexual experience or sexual activity by the complainant ""at or about"" the time of the commission of the alleged offences is not a finding in relation to which this Court, consistently with the principles stated in O'Donoghue, can properly intervene. The times at which the complainant, according to the evidence of Mark Boumansour and Sonia Rahme, took part in acts of prostitution while she was living in the Newcastle area were not fixed by the evidence and were, of course, prior to the complainant travelling to Sydney and prior to the commencement of the period within which the Crown alleged that the offences had been committed. In my opinion, it was open to the trial judge to find that the Newcastle evidence was not evidence of sexual activity or sexual experience either at or about the time of the commission of the alleged offences...

...

[208] In my opinion, the Black Garter evidence satisfied the condition in subpara (i) of s 105(4)(a), as the trial judge in fact held; the evidence satisfied the condition in subpara (ii) as forming part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged offences were committed, adopting the liberal interpretation of this condition stated in R v Morgan; and the probative value of the evidence outweighed any additional distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might have suffered as a result of its admission.""

46In Clark v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 122; (2008) A Crim R 1, an unrepresented appellant at trial sought to question a young complainant to the effect that he had made up the allegations against him in order to hide his own sexual conduct with a friend. On appeal, reliance was placed on s 293(4)(a). Barr J said this at [94]:

""[94] In my opinion his Honour correctly held that the questions framed by the appellant were inadmissible. They were directed to sexual activity said to have been engaged in by the complainant at the appellant's house with SB. Although his Honour did not give detailed formal reasons, he sufficiently informed the parties during the long debate that he was rejecting the questions and why. There was in my opinion no failure to make sufficient record: see R v Dimian at 364. It sufficiently appears that his Honour was of the view that nothing in subs (4) excepted the proposed questions from the prohibition of subs (5). The only provision put forward as having such an effect was subs (4)(a). In my opinion the evidence failed the test of subs (4)(a) because it was not, using the words of (4)(a)(ii), evidence of events alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged proscribed sexual offence was committed. In my view the temporal connection between the two events was not enough. The event contended for by the Crown, namely the attempt by the appellant to recruit the complainant, had no connection with the event contended for by the appellant, in which the complainant committed sexual activity with SB. The appellant was involved in the former but not the latter. The sexual activity was different. The two sets of alleged events were unrelated.""

47In Rolfe v R [2007] NSWCCA 155; (2007) 173 A Crim R 168, the appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. Evidence that the complainant had said to her brother, ""Daddy will rape you"", was not pressed at the trial by defence counsel, who conceded that such evidence was caught by s 293. On appeal Giles JA questioned whether such evidence was indeed excluded because the statement did not necessarily suggest sexual experience on the part of the complainant. The question was whether the decision by the appellant's counsel at trial could amount to a miscarriage of justice. His Honour, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, decided that it could not.

48Finally, in BG v R [2010] NSWCCA 301; (2010) 208 A Crim R 34, the complainant gave evidence of offences alleged to have been committed by the appellant in 1970 and 1971. She had complained in 1997 about sexual offences said to have been committed by others against her many years before, but said nothing about the offences alleged against the appellant until 2005. Counsel for the appellant at trial had led evidence of the 1997 complaints generally, but not of their sexual nature, presumably upon the basis that they would offend s 293 and that he would therby be precluded from doing so. James J referred to this at [75] in these terms:

""[75] As to evidence of the matters in Annex B and evidence of the matters in Annex A if counsel's first submission about Annex A was rejected, it was submitted that both sets of evidence would have fallen within para (a) of subs (4) of section 293 and hence would have been excluded from the prima facie prohibition in subs (3). It was submitted that these matters had occurred ""just before"" or ""just after"" the alleged offences by the appellant were committed and as part of ""the same continuum"" as the alleged offences of the appellant and therefore evidence of these matters was evidence of the complainant's sexual experience or sexual activity ""at or about the time"" of the appellant's alleged offences (subpara (i) of para (a) of subs (4)) and evidence of events that formed part of a connected set of circumstances in which the appellant's offences were committed (subpara (ii) of para (a) of subs (4)).""

49His Honour rejected the submission and said this at [82] - [83]:

""[82] None of the matters described in Annexs A or B could be said to be ""at or about the time"" of the offences allegedly committed by the appellant. The matters described in annexure A occurred between 1962 and 1966 or between 1966 and 1969 (after which the complainant spent some time in a children's home, before going to the appellant's home) or after mid 1971. The matters described in Annex B occurred between 1962 and 1966. It is not possible, in my opinion, to regard matters occurring at any time within a period of a number of years as having occurred ""at or about the time"" of the alleged offences. 

[83] Nor could the matters be said to have formed part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged offences by the appellant were committed. The only real connection was the involvement of the complainant in all of the matters and in the appellant's alleged offences.""

The appellant's submissions

50The appellant submitted that the evidence went to a fact in issue, namely, whether the appellant and KN had sexual contact, and whether KN had a tendency to lie about such things. Alternatively, the appellant contended that it went to the credit of KN and passed the test in s 103 of the Evidence Act 1995. The appellant expressly conceded that the evidence sought to be led disclosed an absence of sexual experience or sexual activity on KN's part and therefore would have been caught by s 293(3), unless it fell within one of the s 293(4) exceptions. The appellant submitted that it fell within s 293(4)(a).

51The appellant argued that the terms of s 293(4)(a)(i) were satisfied. The last alleged sexual assault upon KN by the appellant occurred between 18 October 1992 and 10 November 1992. KN complained on 10 November 1992. She lived with the Hastings family between 24 March 1993 and October 1993. It was while KN was living with John Hastings, and when Amy Hastings had moved out that, according to Amy Hastings, KN was saying to her and others that KN had been in a sexual relationship with Amy's father.

52The relevant provision uses the expression ""at or about the time of"". The allegation about John Hastings was made some months after the allegation about the appellant. The appellant contends that the expression ""must be accorded some elasticity depending upon the evidence and the issues in the trial as a whole"". In this trial, KN was giving evidence in 2011 about sexual acts said to have been committed in 1992. The evidence that the appellant sought to lead related to events in early 1993. The appellant contended in these circumstances that the required temporal element had been satisfied.

53The appellant also argued that the terms of s 293(4)(a)(ii) were satisfied. He submitted that the allegations about John Hastings ""form[ed] part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed"". He contended that the two allegations were ""connected by their numerous similarities"". In this respect the appellant emphasised that complete sexual intercourse had occurred, as demonstrated by the pregnancy allegation, that it was with an older male, with whom she was then living, who was in loco parentis but was not her father and where the sexual intercourse alleged did not involve violence or overt force. The appellant submitted that ""the powerful similarity of the allegations made about the appellant [and] John Hastings fulfils the requirements of subsection (4)(a)(ii)"". 

54The appellant contended that the evidence should have been admitted and that its exclusion amounted to an error of law. He made the following written submissions:

""The authorities...demonstrate that there is room for flexibility with regard to the temporal requirement in subsection (4)(a)(i), and also with regard to subsection (4)(a)(ii).

More generally, I accept that accused persons and this Court must take the legislation...as it is, and not shy away from an unjust or arbitrary result if that is what Parliament clearly intended. And of course, it is well known that, for many years, s 293 and its predecessors have been the subject of trenchant calls for reform by senior judges and lawyers.

Nevertheless, even accepting those propositions, if the evidence sought to be led by the defence solicitor is not admissible, it leads to very peculiar results in the particular circumstances of this case. On the one hand, the evidence of the diary is admitted in the prosecution case, despite revealing consensual sexual conduct on the part of a fifteen year old girl with a person other than the appellant. On the other hand, evidence sought to be led by the defence that raises the absence of consensual sexual conduct on the part of the complainant, and that is admitted only to demonstrate that her allegations against the appellant are not to be believed, and that says nothing about her promiscuity or lack of sexual morality, is excluded, even despite its remarkable similarity to the allegations against the appellant.

One should not overlook the need for the evidence to comply with the concluding words of s 293(4). Because the first gate of inclusion was not opened, no evidence was presented with regard to the second gate. But this Court would accept that the test in those concluding words is made out. The evidence would have had extremely high probative value. It should be assessed on the basis that it would have been accepted: R v Shamouil (2006) 66 NSWLR 228. For the jury to have heard that, some months after the time of the making of the first complaint against the appellant, the complainant falsely accused another older man of sexual contact with her, would have had a devastating effect on the Crown case.""

55The appellant made further submissions concerning the proviso, to which reference is made later in these reasons.

The Crown's submissions

56The Crown referred in detail to the authorities. The Crown submitted that the appellant had failed to establish that the trial judge's decision to exclude the evidence was an error of law. In particular, the Crown submitted that neither the temporal requirement contained in s 293(4)(a)(i), nor the existence of a connected set of circumstances mandated by s 293(4)(a)(ii), had been established.

Consideration

57It is uncontroversial that the original version of s 293 was introduced to limit the circumstances in which complainants in sexual assault cases would have to endure having what might otherwise be personal and sensitive matters examined in public: see R v White at 340.

58Allen J referred at 556 - 557 in his remarks in R v M to what had been said in Parliament when the original legislation was being debated:

""In his speech the Premier said:

'Finally, the bill will prohibit irrelevant questioning of sexual assault victims about their prior sexual behaviour. This provision is based upon the premise that a person who seeks sexual intercourse with another should not be able to rely on scandal or gossip about the other person or on rumour or knowledge of that other person's sexual behaviour with others, as a basis of assuming consent to intercourse. The law should not - and under this legislation will not - allow the accused to subject the victim of the sexual assault to humiliating and irrelevant questioning about details of previous sexual conduct and attitudes. At the present time many victims believe that the humiliation they would face as a witness in court outweighs all other considerations. I have every confidence that this provision will play a significant part in encouraging victims to report offences, and ensure that such victims will be treated justly and humanely by the judicial system' (Hansard, No 41, p 4761).

I construe the section on the understanding that the principal deficiency in the pre-existing law, as administered by the courts, was understood by Parliament to be as stated by the Premier and that the principal purpose of s 409B was to remedy that deficiency. It does not follow that the Premier was essaying an exhaustive analysis of the pre-existing law. Manifestly he was not. Under the then existing law cross-examination as to prior sexual experience of the complainant was admitted on credit, independently of any relevance to the issue of accused's belief as to consent: Gregory (1983) 151 CLR 566; 10 A Crim R 234; McGarvey (aka Garner) (1987) 10 NSWLR 632; 34 A Crim R 119; White. Nor does it follow from the Premier's brief remarks that the correction of the evil briefly described by the Premier constituted the totality of the reform sought to be effected as distinct from being its main thrust. Indeed, the Premier indicated that he was to be followed in the House by the Attorney-General who would refer ""in detail"" to the matter which he had just referred to (as well as other aspects of the Bill). In following the Premier the Attorney-General said:

'Given this historical background it is not surprising that authorities agree that rape is one of the most underreported crimes. Humiliation, fear of stigma, judgmental treatment by authorities, fear of family difficulties and disruptions, and drawn out legal proceedings are some of the reasons why women do not report sexual violence ... The deficiency of the present law is that a victim may be cross-examined about sexual behaviour with other persons, possibly years before, in circumstances quite irrelevant to the case in question. For example, if an intruder breaks into a house and sexually assaults a married woman whose husband happens to be away on holidays, it is surely ridiculous to allow the woman giving evidence against the alleged rapist to be questioned about whether, for example, she had intercourse with anybody other than her husband before she got married. The fear of this type of cross-examination has been a potent cause of reluctance on the part of women to report sexual assault. The old law and practice, therefore, has actually been a cause of crime. It has discouraged the reporting of crime, and encouraged criminals in the knowledge that they could escape prosecution.

The old law was thoroughly bad and the Government intends to change it extensively'.""

59The legislative purpose behind the predecessor to s 293 was also reviewed in R v Henning (Unreported, NSWCCA, 11 May 1990) and R v M at 556 - 559.

60The section creates what amounts to a blanket prohibition on adducing evidence that discloses or implies that the complainant in a prescribed sexual offence case has or may have had sexual experience or lack of sexual experience. Unless one of the exceptions to the prohibition is established, the evidence is inadmissible and there is no residual discretion for the trial judge to admit it: see Taylor v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 180 at [47].

Conclusions

61The clear forensic purpose behind the appellant's attempts to cross-examine KN about what she allegedly told Amy Hastings, and to introduce Amy Hastings evidence about it, was to portray KN as a girl who at the time of the alleged sexual offences committed by the appellant was prepared to make, or had on that occasion at least made, untrue and fanciful allegations of sexual conduct with an older man in authority over her. The similarity between the offences charged and the content of alleged statements made by KN about John Hastings went directly to the issue of KN's credit in circumstances where her status as a witness of truth, concerning otherwise uncorroborated allegations of sexual offences committed by the appellant, was critical to the Crown's case. His Honour correctly identified this in the course of certain remarks that he made to counsel during discussions on the voir dire.

62In my view the evidence in question was evidence ""of the complainant's sexual experience"" or ""of the complainant's sexual activity"". Although there was some preliminary discussion in this Court concerning the question of whether the evidence in question was evidence of any kind of sexual experience or sexual activity, as opposed to it being evidence only of a propensity to fantasize about sexual experience or activity, it was uncontroversially accepted in the end that the evidence was evidence of a type described in s 293(4)(a)(i).

63Was the evidence in question also evidence of KN's sexual experience or lack of it, or sexual activity or lack of it taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged sexual offence by the appellant? Importantly, the words in the subparagraph are ""taken part in by the complainant"". They serve on one view to distinguish between sexual experience and sexual activity. The former rather encompasses a state acquired over time, whether long or short, but which refers to the condition of having had experience in sexual matters, as opposed to a single or isolated sexual experience, or a number of them, at some particular time. The inquiry brought forward by the words ""sexual experience or lack of sexual experience"" appears to be related to whether the complainant was or was not ""sexually experienced"". In contrast, the latter suggests a discrete sexual activity or lack of it that occurred, or in which the complainant took part or did not take part, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged offence by the appellant, but not at some other time. 

64The distinction may be critical, because any complainant's sexual experience, in the historical sense, will necessarily be his or her sexual experience ""at or about"" the relevant time. In other words, a complainant's sexual experience will be his or her state of being at or about the time of the commission of any alleged prescribed sexual offence because that state of sexual experience or lack of sexual experience will in an ambulatory fashion always exist at the relevant time. On the contrary, evidence of particular sexual activity may clearly be either activity at or about the time of the commission of the alleged offence or it may not. The words ""taken part in by the complainant"" clearly relate only to sexual activity or lack of sexual activity, and not to the complainant's sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, because of the commas surrounding the words ""or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant"". In this way, evidence that relates to a complainant's general state of sexual experience may more readily satisfy the temporal test in subparagraph (4)(a)(i) than evidence relating to singular acts of sexual activity or lack of it in which the complainant is alleged to have taken part.

65That distinction may be less significant having regard to the words used in s 293(4)(a)(ii). That is because that subparagraph speaks in terms of the evidence being ""of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances"". In that way the historical experience of the complainant appears to be restricted or limited to sexual experience that is also capable of being described as or at least restricted or related to an event. 

66In the present case the evidence in question is directly related to a particular ""sexual activity taken part in by the complainant"" and not to her state of sexual experience generally. The evidence is limited to the complainant's alleged sexual activity with John Hastings. The question is whether it is evidence of something that occurred ""at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence"". In my opinion it is not. It did not take place ""at the time"". It could only have taken place ""at about the time"". It did not take place at about the time of the alleged sexual offences or either of them in the sense that it took place some three or so months later. The issue to which the exception in subparagraph (4)(a)(i) is presently directed is the achievement of a fair balance between the lost forensic advantage to the appellant if it applies, having regard to the probative value of the evidence on the one hand, and the distress, humiliation or embarrassment that KN might suffer if the evidence were admitted on the other hand. Having regard to that equation, it does not seem to me that the subject matter of the alleged conversation between Amy Hastings and KN took place at about the time that the appellant was allegedly sexually abusing her. In the vernacular, it took place some time later.

67It is even clearer in my view that the evidence is not evidence of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged sexual offences committed by the appellant were committed. They are distinctly unconnected. There is no ""set of circumstances"" at all. It is in my view a mistake to attempt to connect events as part of a set of circumstances by reference only to the fact that the events in each case are arguably similar. The alleged or apparent similarities do not necessarily or reliably inform the question of whether or not the events form part of a connected set of circumstances.

68In this case the evidence related to the question of whether or not KN had a sexual relationship with John Hastings. There is no connection between that alleged event and either of the alleged sexual offences apart from the identity of KN as a person involved in each case. That does not lead to, or even approach, a conclusion that the two events form part of a connected set of circumstances.

The proviso to s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act

69Having regard to the view I have formed about the correctness of the trial judge's decision concerning the admissibility of Amy Hastings' evidence, it is not strictly necessary to consider the proviso. However, as both parties addressed the issue it is proper that I express my view about it.

70The appellant expressly accepted for the purposes of the hearing in this Court that the content of two intercepted telephone conversations between him and KN enhanced the strength of the Crown case at trial in the sense that it tended to corroborate KN's complaints. The appellant did not accept that these conversations, when examined closely, actually incriminated him. On the contrary, the appellant submitted that a proper consideration of what the appellant is recorded as saying to KN leads to the conclusion that he said what he said in a state of exasperation and in an attempt to cause KN to ""get off the phone and stop harassing him"". 

71The appellant contended in those circumstances that this Court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offences had been proven, and would not apply the proviso. Alternatively, the appellant submitted that even if this Court were so satisfied, it would regard the erroneous exclusion of the evidence referred to earlier, which the appellant contended has a significant degree of probative value in a child sexual assault trial, as not being an error to which the proviso could be applied.

72In contrast, the Crown submitted that in the event that an error of law had been established, the appeal should in any case be dismissed upon the basis that no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred. The Crown contended that the case against the appellant was made compelling by the admissions he made during the recorded telephone calls with KN. Any evidence that Amy Hastings might have given about the asserted allegations made by KN would have had little credibility. That was said to be for at least two reasons. First, the version of events in Amy Hastings' statement and the version given by her in evidence on the voir dire concerning why she said to her father ""it's her or me"" were completely at odds one with the other. Secondly, the Crown submitted that Amy Hastings had an axe to grind with KN as the result of a falling out that they had had over an unrelated matter. It is unnecessary to elaborate upon these matters for present purposes.

73Part of the intercepted telephone conversation between KN and the appellant that took place on 7 March 2010 was as follows:

""A: Hello [K]. Yeah?

KN: Hello. You raped me and I want to know why you raped me. You had sex with me and my mother at the same time.

A: I'm listenin'.

KN: Why? That's sick.

A: I'm still listenin' to you [K]. Anything else you want to say?

KN: Yes, I, I want to know why?

A: Is that all you've got to say?

KN: Please George, you told me on the last phone call that I needed to get over it. What I need to get over is to know why you had sex with me?

A: Why do you think?

KN: Why do I think you had sex with me?

A: Yeah.

KN: I don't know. I was 15.

A: And why can't you not get over it and get on with your life?

KN: Because you were supposed to be my father figure. You tell me why you had sex with me.

A: I tried to be the best father figure I could be to you and, and make sure that you got the best out of life that you could get. And I did my best to sort of, bring you, bring you to that stage where you are now.

KN: And that included having sex with me?

A: It included me making sure that you, you got to where you are now.""

74The earlier recorded conversation on 15 February 2010 contains a series of denials by the appellant that he did anything wrong. He uses expressions like ""there's nothing [for me] to answer for"" and ""I didn't do nothin' to ya"". The first recorded conversation does not contain any arguably unambiguous statements or admissions of any sort.

75The second conversation arguably does so. The answer, ""Why do you think?"", seems to me to be quite a significant response in the context of that conversation, with the appellant replying to KN's inquiry of him about why he had sex with her. This was material that was before the jury and which they were entitled to consider having regard to the whole of the evidence in assessing whether or not they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. That other evidence necessarily included the evidence of KN. Even if the evidence of Amy Hastings had been wrongly rejected, so that its admission may have cast some doubt upon the reliability of KN's story, it seems to me in the light of the material contained in at least the second intercepted telephone conversation that it is highly unlikely that any substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. However, it is not possible for me to be satisfied of that to the necessary standard and disposition of this appeal does not require that a final conclusion about it should be expressed.

Orders

76In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

77BEECH-JONES J: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Harrison J. Subject to what follows I agree with his Honour's reasons.

78The evidence that was the subject of the application had two components. The first component was the statement that Amy Hastings asserted KN made sometime in 1993 to the effect that she was in a relationship with John Hastings and he had impregnated her. The second component was that KN had not in fact been in a relationship with John Hastings and had not had sex with him. On the voir dire KN denied she had made that statement referred to in the first component. Although it was not expressly stated, it seems that she would have agreed with the second component in that she would have denied having been in a relationship with John Hastings or having had sex with him. 

79Both components of this evidence are prima facie inadmissible under s 293(3). The first is excluded by either or both of s 293(3)(a) and (b) because it discloses or implies that KN may have had a sexual experience or taken part in sexual activity. The second is excluded by s 293(3)(b) because it discloses or implies that she has ""not taken part in any sexual activity"".

80As noted by Harrison J, it is then necessary to consider s 293(4). Each component of this evidence is clearly evidence ""of"" KN's ""sexual experience or lack of sexual experience"" or ""of"" her ""sexual activity or lack of sexual activity"" for the purposes of s 293(4)(a)(i). However for the reasons given by Harrison J, it is doubtful that they can be considered to be evidence of such activity or experience taken part in ""at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence"".

81In my view the real difficulty for the appellant concerns s 293(4)(a)(ii). It refers to evidence ""of events"". If the evidence is broken down into its two components and each is considered against s 293(4)(a)(ii), then it travels nowhere. With the second component, evidence that KN did not have sex with John Hastings is clearly not evidence of an ""event' connected to the ""set of circumstances"" in which the offence occurred. With the first component, evidence that KN in effect said she had sex with John Hastings has the same problem. Further it would not be of much assistance to the appellant without the second component. 

82The adoption of a more favourable approach for the appellant of considering the evidence in combination does not assist either. With such an approach the only relevant ""event"" it could be considered evidence ""of"" is the making of a false accusation against an older male in whose house KN was living. The making of that false statement, if that is what occurred, does not ""form part of a connected set of circumstances"" in which the subject offences took place. It is not part of the narrative of events that lead to the offence nor is it part of the immediate aftermath. It does not provide a piece of any jigsaw puzzle concerning the ""set of circumstances"" in which the offence was said to have been committed. 

83In those cases reviewed by Harrison J where evidence was found to fall within this exception, the evidence was of some ""event"" that had relevance beyond what it might reveal about the complainant's credit. They concerned an event that was in each case found to be so connected to the circumstances of the offence that it bore on the objective likelihood of the offence having been committed. In R v Morgan, the conduct of the complainant in having intercourse with her boyfriend within 1 to 2 hours of the sexual assault having occurred ""could be seen by the jury as making the occurrence of the offence less likely"" (at p. 551E per Mahoney JA) and formed part of ""the context in which the alleged offence was committed and against which the complainant's evidence might reasonably be evaluated"" (at p. 544F per Gleeson CJ). Similarly in R v Rahme, Sully J at least found that evidence of the complainant's previous (apparently voluntary) occupation as a prostitute had been wrongly rejected as those events had an appreciable connection with the set of circumstance surrounding the alleged offence, bearing in mind that the appellant was charged with having forced her into prostitution. According to his Honour, it went beyond her credit and to ""the very heart of the facts in issue at the trial"" (at [59]). In contrast in this case, the making of an allegedly false accusation against another older male might have impacted on KN's credit but it did not reveal an ""event"" that was so connected to the circumstances of the offence that it bore on the objective likelihood of the offence having occurred. 

84For the sake of completeness I should add that evidence that a complainant has given an inconsistent version of the events the subject of the offence would in my view fall within s 293(4). The evidence of the uttering of the statement would clearly be evidence ""of"" sexual experience or lack of it at the time of the alleged offence as well as evidence ""of"" events that are connected to the set of circumstances that give rise to the offence, being the offence itself. The same reasoning applies to evidence of complaint made by a victim of a sexual offence.

85Unlike Harrison J, had I concluded that the evidence was admissible then I would not have been sufficiently satisfied on the material before me of the appellant's guilt to enable the application of the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The second telephone conversation set out in the judgment of Harrison J at [73] is not particularly helpful for the appellant. However it needs to be considered with the first conversation in which the appellant repeatedly denied acting improperly. The second interview is perhaps explicable on the basis that the appellant was trying to avoid directly denying KN's allegation as that would simply prolong the conversation as had occurred with the first conversation. While the second conversation does provide some support for KN and there are inconsistencies in Amy Hastings' evidence, the ""natural limitations"" that inhibit an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record are such that I could not reach the necessary degree of satisfaction as to the appellant's guilt taking into account the excluded evidence (Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [41]). That said I agree with Harrison J that the evidence was correctly excluded.

86I agree with Harrison J that the appeal should be dismissed.

2759705,Attorney General (NSW) v Lipton [2012] NSWCCA 156,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The respondent entered pleas of guilty in respect of two offences involving the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. He has yet to be sentenced for those offences.

The respondent sought access to any documents in the custody of the Commissioner of Police recording communications between members of the police force and Ms Brown, a person he suspected of being a police informer. His counsel suggested that he intended to allege at the sentencing hearing that Ms Brown had encouraged him to increase the quantity of drugs in each successive transaction.

The Commissioner of Police produced certain documents to the Court but objected to their disclosure to the respondent on the basis of public interest immunity. On 24 February 2012 Finnane DCJ indicated that he would order that the documents be disclosed to the respondent. The Attorney General appealed to this Court, pursuant to Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5F, against the interlocutory order of Finnane DCJ.

The issues for determination on appeal were:

(i) whether a claim of public interest immunity involving an informer is capable of being overcome for the purposes of a sentencing hearing, and if so

(ii) whether the material sought met the threshold for disclosure.

The Court held (per Basten JA, Hoeben JA and McCallum J agreeing), allowing the appeal:

In relation to (i)

1. Where non-production is necessary in order to protect the identity of the informant and the information disclosed by an informant, it may be doubted that a rule existed under the general law that the only available exception is the public interest in preventing an accused person properly defending himself or herself against conviction: [36]-[37]

Marks v Beyfus (1890) 25 QBD 494; D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children [1971] AC 232 referred to.

2. The balancing exercise required by Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 130 is not to be constrained by unexpressed rules derived from the common law: [39]

In relation to (ii)

3. The primary judge erred in his consideration of the factors relevant to the making of a disclosure order: [49]-[58]

4. This Court is not in a position to determine whether the material met the threshold for disclosure. Without the benefit of evidence from the respondent as to any statement of Ms Brown that influenced him in some manner, there is a risk that the Court might miss an arguable point: [62]

5. The respondent has not demonstrated that the material may be relevant to a real and not hypothetical issue with respect to his sentencing, such as a specific enticement which affected his conduct: [68]




			Judgment

1BASTEN JA: On 5 November 2009 Mr Richard Lipton (""the respondent"") entered pleas of guilty in respect of two offences involving the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The first charge related to 1.101 kilograms of cocaine; the second charge related to 586.9 grams of MDMA. He has yet to be sentenced for those offences. Sentencing has been delayed because the respondent has sought (and not so far obtained) access to any documents in the custody of the Commissioner of Police recording communications between members of the police force and Ms Melanie Brown. (The precise description of the class of documents sought has varied over time.)

2Ms Brown had been in a relationship with the respondent prior to the time of the offences. She was suspected by him, at least after his arrest, of providing information to the police, although his arrest resulted from the recipient of the drugs being an undercover police officer.

3The present appeal is brought by the Attorney General from an interlocutory decision of Finnane DCJ ordering the Commissioner to provide the respondent with access to certain documents. The appeal should be upheld and the order set aside. To explain why that should occur requires reference to the procedural history of the matter.

Procedural history
4The procedural history of this matter has been fraught; it has been attended by missteps at almost every stage of the process. This Court does not have the full procedural history before it.

5On 25 November 2009 a subpoena was issued to the Commissioner of Police on behalf of the respondent seeking four categories of documents. The Commissioner, by notice of motion filed in the District Court, sought to set aside paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 to the schedule to the subpoena: R v Lipton, Richard [2010] NSWDC 187 at [1] (King DCJ). Neither the subpoena nor the notice of motion is otherwise before this Court. However, as appears from the judgment of this Court in Lipton v R [2010] NSWCCA 175 at [4], paragraph 4 in the schedule referred to ""[a]ll written or electronic records of communications between any officer of the NSW police and Melanie Brown"".

6Again as explained by King DCJ, the principal ground in the motion to have the subpoena set aside was the absence of any legitimate forensic purpose for the production of the documents. A second ground, if the Court were satisfied as to legitimate forensic purpose, was that ""any documents would be protected by a claim of public interest immunity"": at [5]. King DCJ was not satisfied that there was a legitimate forensic purpose and ordered that paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of the schedule to the subpoena be set aside: at [26]. As accepted by King DCJ and explained in this Court by McClellan CJ at CL (Hislop J and Barr AJ agreeing) there might have been a legitimate forensic purpose in establishing that, if Ms Brown took steps to coerce, pressure or entice the respondent to deal with the undercover officer to an extent or in a manner which he would not otherwise have done, Ms Brown had acted as an agent of the authorities. Such conduct could have provided an element of mitigation of sentence. However, there was no evidence from the respondent to demonstrate that Ms Brown had encouraged him to commit the offences, absent which the question of her relationship with the authorities did not arise. Accordingly, this Court upheld the ruling of King DCJ and dismissed the application for leave to appeal.

7McClellan CJ at CL anticipated that the setting aside of those paragraphs of the subpoena might not be an end of the matter as the respondent might issue a further subpoena and bring evidence that Ms Brown had acted to coerce, pressure or entice him to deal with the undercover officer: at [22]. Depending on the nature of that evidence, the reasoning continued, it might be possible to infer from matters already known which suggested that Ms Brown was acting in collusion with the police, ""together with the fact that a volume of documents has been produced to the Court in answer to the relevant paragraphs of the schedule to the subpoena"", that the documents might materially assist the respondent's case on sentence. His Honour further noted that paragraph 4, in its original form, was ""extremely wide and may capture documents which have no relevance to the present applicant"": at [23].

8The initial response of the Commissioner to the subpoena, as revealed above, is puzzling for two reasons. First, the production of documents to the Court (however that occurred) was inconsistent with the application to ""set aside the subpoena"". Secondly, and more importantly, the production of documents identified as answering the description in paragraph 4 of the subpoena, namely recording communications between Ms Brown and the police, constituted an implicit acceptance of the fact of that relationship. To then claim public interest immunity on the basis that disclosure of the documents might reveal the existence of a police informer was, in effect, to disclose precisely that which was sought to be protected.

9The Court is not privy to the decision-making which underlay those actions, but they sowed the seeds for more than two further years of attempts to undo the consequences. It is appropriate, therefore, to note that there were alternative courses available which could have avoided the unfortunate consequences which have come to pass.

10Relevantly for present purposes, there are two broad categories of case involving police informers and disclosure of their identity. In the one case, the accused suspects, or even knows, that the police have relied upon information supplied to them by third parties, but does not know the identity of the informant. The other category, which includes the present case, arises where the accused knows very well the identity of the individual suspected of being an informer, but does not know whether that individual has a relationship with the police. In the latter case, to disclose the existence of documents recording that relationship may be to concede the very point which the claimed immunity is designed to preserve. The situation is not unique: it arose in the seminal case of Alister v The Queen [1984] HCA 85; 154 CLR 404. In Alister, the case against the accused had depended significantly on the evidence of a Mr Richard John Seary, who had joined the Ananda Marga, of which the accused were members, as an undercover agent. In order to attack his credibility, the accused had sought access to any document relating to the applicants supplied by Mr Seary to ASIO. Whether he was an agent for ASIO was not known. The trial judge set aside the subpoena directed to ASIO. The appeal challenged that order. However, as noted by Brennan J, at 452, a different procedural course might have been appropriate:

""Perhaps the order to set the subpoena aside was wrong in any event, the appropriate order being an order excusing the officer in charge of ASIO from the obligation to state whether ASIO had possession of documents answering the description set out in the subpoena and from the obligation to produce any such documents.""

That course should have been adopted by the police in the present case, but was not. 

11It is convenient now to return to the procedural history. Rather than issue a further subpoena, the respondent sought a stay of the sentencing proceeding ""until such time as the Crown discloses to the defence materials relating to communications between members of the New South Wales Police Force and Melanie Brown in relation to the investigation into the matters which are the subject of the charges against the offender, currently in the possession of the New South Wales Police"": R v Richard Lipton (No 2) [2010] NSWDC 295 (Finnane DCJ) at [7]. (The notice of motion itself, dated 11 October 2010, was not before this Court.) The District Court did not make an order in that form, but did order a stay until the Director of Public Prosecutions had sought and obtained from the police all documents pertaining to the relationship between the police and Ms Melanie Brown; had formed an opinion as to whether the documents may be relevant to any matter of sentence and had communicated that opinion to the respondent's lawyers. In the course of his judgment Finnane DCJ stated:

""13. What is abundantly clear from a consideration of the judgments of Judge King and the Court of Criminal Appeal is that there is material linking Melanie Brown to the offender and to the Police and it should be obvious to the prosecuting authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions that there is material available which is relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case, namely the culpability of the offender and whether this is lessened in any way by the activities of and relationship with Melanie Brown.

14. It also seems obvious to me that there could be no public interest in suppressing her name since it is publicly known. Part of her role is already known and there is every reason to believe that Police officers have in their possession material that could relate to the relevant issues in the sentencing of the offender.

15. What is also clear is that Mr Allison has taken the view that because there has been a claim of public interest immunity by the Police, he has no obligation to inquire further.""

12It will be necessary to return to that reasoning when reconsidering the question of legitimate forensic purpose and the consistency of that reasoning with the 2010 decision of this Court. The order was the subject of an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, which was dismissed: Regina v Richard Lipton [2011] NSWCCA 247. Judgment was delivered on 17 November 2011.

13On 8 December 2011 the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions wrote to the respondent's solicitor advising that the Director had ""reviewed all documents pertaining to the relationship"" and had formed the opinion that ""there are documents amongst them that may be relevant to a matter of sentence of the offender"" but that those documents were, in the Director's view, subject to a claim of public interest immunity.

14Despite the limitations on the views expressed by the Director, namely that only some of the documents pertaining to the relationship between the police and Ms Brown may be relevant to sentence, it appears that the Commissioner then abandoned any argument based on lack of a legitimate forensic purpose. Further, although the subpoena, originally issued on 25 November 2009, was potentially wider than the terms of the stay order and the relevant paragraph had in any event been set aside at a hearing on 16 December 2011 in the District Court, senior counsel for the respondent called upon the subpoena and the Commissioner's representative handed up a bundle of documents which had been prepared in response to the subpoena, but sought to maintain the objection based on public interest immunity. (Whether the documents so produced were the same as those which had apparently been produced to the Court in 2010 is not clear.) The claim based on immunity was formalised by a notice of motion returnable on 16 December 2011, supported by both an open and a confidential affidavit. Paragraph 4 of the open affidavit stated:

""The Commissioner makes a claim for public interest immunity in relation to the disclosure of information, whether adduced in evidence or contained in a document, that could reveal or tend to reveal the identity of any person who has assisted police in their investigations or that could reveal details of any information in police intelligence holdings available for use in current or future criminal investigations.""

15The affidavit further stated that the deponent, being an Assistant Commissioner of Police, had no objection to the Court inspecting the confidential exhibit and affidavit but submitted that access to the confidential material ""beyond the Court would be as harmful to the public interest as would be the disclosure of the information sought to be protected"": paragraph 15. The reference to ""the Court"" in this context was clearly intended to be a reference to the judge, as the orders sought in the motion, in support of which the affidavit was read, included a denial of access ""to all parties to the proceedings"": order 4(b).

16After receiving the material, Finnane DCJ purportedly closed the court: Tcpt, 16/12/11, p 3 (6). There was, however, a dispute as to whether the respondent's father should be entitled to remain in the Court. At the request of the respondent's counsel, the judge indicated that he would allow the respondent's father to remain. In response to an incomplete request by counsel for the Commissioner to be heard on that issue, the judge stated:

""I'm not going to publicly reveal what's in the documents am I, I mean the Courts have frank discussions even in a closed court, I don't reveal what's in them. I think that would be entirely wrong were I to say Well look let's be frank, let me tell you all what's in these. I can't really do that ....""

17Senior counsel for the respondent then identified the forensic purpose to be relied on in the following terms at pp 4-5:

""More precisely the position is that this was an operation under the auspices of the New South Wales Crime Commission carried out by the New South Wales police and it involved what I've seen ... described as a well known technique of ramping up the amounts of the drug until such time as the amounts in total supplied by the offender exceeded the large commercial limit and of course the minute that that happened they were then arrested. ... The precise point that Mr Lipton makes is that he got out of his depth and out of his league when the amounts got bigger but Melanie Brown was encouraging him to continue to deal with the undercover officer because she said he could be trusted and because she needed the money because she had lost her job and he ought to get on with it.""

18There then ensued debate with counsel for the Commissioner in the course of which the primary judge made remarks which could have been understood to be disclosing the contents of the documents before a member of the public who would have been in a position to relay the remarks to the respondent (and indeed the world at large). At the end of the hearing, the primary judge stated in open court (Tcpt, p 19 (45)):

""I order a transcript from today. It can be made available to each of the parties. Mr Lipton can have a free copy, but I make it plain: I will not make that transcript available to the press.""

19To the extent that the order closing the Court had not already been subverted, that step effectively revoked it. The Court reconvened on 24 February 2012, at which stage the primary judge delivered a judgment. It appears from an exchange with counsel for the Commissioner after the commencement of the delivery of the judgment that although the Court was again ""closed"", the judge allowed the respondent's parents and brother to remain: Tcpt, 24/02/12, p 2. No constraint was placed on communication by them to any person. His Honour then indicated that some of the material should be suppressed. He said (Tcpt, p 5):

""The material showing contact between her and police officers, what she said to them about the offender, the information that she passed on, in my opinion, is material which can be and should be shown to the offender's legal representatives because it is possible that it may assist them in some way in presenting their arguments on sentence.

In my opinion, the interests of the offender being able to present a proper case outweigh any possible claim of public interest in suppression of the information and, therefore, I proposed to reveal that material, that is, the material that I have looked at which I consider should be revealed. I do not have it here at this very minute and I will have to make it available in an edited form. 

The use that can be made of it is a matter for the parties. I would make an order that the legal representatives of the parties can use it for these proceedings, and to the extent necessary to do so they can discuss the material with their client. But the material cannot be used for any other proceedings and if they judge there is no use they can make of the material, it should be handed back to the Court and will be given back, then, to the police.""

20Following the delivery of the judgment, it appears that the Court remained ""closed"". Counsel for the Commissioner then sought a stay of the ""orders"" for 28 days to enable a consideration of an appeal. The primary judge determined that he would adjourn for a period of seven days to allow the Commissioner to consider his position, whilst commenting in pejorative terms on the application. He then directed that his ""remarks today be taken out and made available to the parties forthwith"": Tcpt, p 2 (13). After that, and following some further discussion, counsel for the Commissioner noted that it might be necessary to obtain the documents which were to be released and the editing which had been proposed. The primary judge then responded that he was simply deleting material which might be used to locate Ms Brown and proceeded to describe the contents of the material to be released, in summary terms: Tcpt, p 3 (12)-(21). That statement would also have been made available, presumably, to each of the parties ""forthwith"".

Issues on appeal
21The stay of the release of the documents themselves has continued. On 30 March 2012 the Attorney General filed a notice of appeal against the judgment and orders in the District Court made on 24 February 2012, the appeal being pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

22The notice of appeal did not identify with any degree of particularity the grounds of the appeal. However, the appellant's written submissions of 4 May 2012 allow the grounds to be summarised in the following terms:

(1) a valid claim of public interest immunity involving an informer can only be overcome if the material has a sufficient bearing on the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused, and is not capable of being overcome merely for the purposes of a sentencing hearing;
(2) in the alternative, if the immunity may be lost for the purposes of a sentencing hearing, the material sought in the present case does not meet the threshold for disclosure, and
(3) the primary judge failed to give adequate reasons for his decisions.

23In the event that the first two grounds failed, but the third ground succeeded, the Attorney submitted that the material should be reconsidered by this Court and a decision made as to what if any documents should be disclosed to the respondent.

24For the reasons given below, ground 1, asserting an absolute limitation on the power to disclose, should be rejected. Grounds 2 and 3 may be considered together, and should be upheld on the basis that the reasons of the primary judge reveal the wrong test was applied. That being so, the objection to disclosure must be reconsidered. In this context, it will be necessary to have regard to the procedural history and the disclosures made by Finnane DCJ in court at a time when the court was not closed to the public, in the accepted sense of that term.

Jurisdiction of court
25An appeal lies as of right at the instance of the Attorney General (and the Director of Public Prosecutions) in respect of an ""interlocutory judgment or order"" which is given or made ""in proceedings"". A ruling with respect to the admissibility of evidence is generally considered not to be such a judgment or order, although clearly made in the proceedings: R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633. An objection to evidence based on public interest immunity will frequently give rise to an evidential ruling as to admissibility in the course of proceedings. However, such objections may also arise in respect of production of documents in answer to a subpoena or other form of court process or court order. Rulings on such objections have uniformly been treated as falling within the scope of s 5F: Attorney General (NSW) v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 673C-D (Hunt CJ at CL, Studdert J agreeing) and 689B-C (Smart J); Attorney General v Kaddour [2001] NSWCCA 456 at [2] (Sully J, Spigelman CJ and Adams J agreeing); R v Fandakis [2002] NSWCCA 5 at [10] (Barr J, Ipp AJA and Hidden J agreeing); Attorney General (NSW) v Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 65; 182 A Crim R 536 at [33] (Beazley JA, James and Kirby JJ agreeing); Nagi v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 197 at [25]-[27]; WO v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 275 at [59]; Derbas v R [2012] NSWCCA 14 at [1] (Meagher JA, Hoeben and Rothman JJ agreeing).

26Although the court is now required to determine an objection to production ""as if [it] were an objection to the giving or adducing of evidence"" - see Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 131A, discussed below - there was no submission in this Court that the line of authority as to an appeal under s 5F was affected by that provision. Accordingly, it should be accepted that the appeal was properly brought by the Attorney, as of right.

Principles as to public interest immunity
27A further preliminary issue arose in relation to the principles governing the substantive issue. In a supplementary submission dealing with the question of jurisdiction, senior counsel for the Attorney submitted that the issue was to be addressed by reference to s 130 of the Evidence Act, which section, although dealing with the admissibility of evidence, was applicable by virtue of s 131A of the Evidence Act. Section 131A constituted a device by which the question of production could be assessed by reference to the test applicable to admissibility. As a matter of principle, that approach had much to commend it. However, it was not the approach adopted by this Court in Derbas, a judgment delivered on 21 February 2012. That case, like the present matter, involved a claim of immunity from disclosure in the public interest made by the Commissioner of Police. Meagher JA rejected the Attorney's submission that the matter was to be addressed by reference to s 130 of the Evidence Act, concluding that s 130 was not engaged and that it was necessary to address the application for immunity by reference to common law principles: at [6].

28Although the Attorney also submitted in Derbas that nothing turned on the answer to this question, that may not be right. In support of ground 1, the Attorney argued that there was an inflexible rule that once the identity of an informer was raised, the only basis for rejecting the objection was the need for disclosure to show that the defendant was innocent of the offence: Cain v Glass (No 2) (1985) 3 NSWLR 230 at 248 (McHugh JA, Kirby P agreeing). That was said to be a principle of the common law; even if that were right, it is less clear that it is a principle which fits within the language of s 130. The irony of the Attorney's position is thus that if s 130 is applied, as he submits it should be, he may fail on ground 1.

29Under s 131A, if a person is required by a subpoena to produce a document of a kind ""referred to in"" Division 3 (which includes s 130) and ""the person objects to ... providing that document"", the court must determine the objection by applying the provisions of s 130 with any necessary modifications ""as if the objection ... were an objection to the giving or adducing of evidence"". (Once the objection is treated as an objection to giving evidence, it is not clear what modifications to, say, s 130 are contemplated.)

30As noted by the writers of a standard text on the Evidence Act, the use of ""the circuitous drafting device"" adopted in s 131A ""gives rise to fundamental problems"": J Anderson, N Williams SC, L Clegg, The New Law of Evidence (2nd ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2009) at [131A.3]. One problem noted by the authors is that the section appears to operate only where the person required to produce the document is the person who objects to production. If the first person is not the holder of the privilege, the section may not be engaged. 

31This approach has been accepted in relation to public interest immunity and a statutory corporation. Thus, in State of New South Wales v Public Transport Ticketing Corporation [2011] NSWCA 60 at [26] Allsop P stated (with the agreement of Hodgson JA and Sackville AJA):

""The State submitted that the terms of s 131A(1) were not engaged. That was so, it was submitted, because the State, which had the carriage of the upholding of the immunity was not a person subject to a disclosure requirement who objects to giving that information or document. The PTTC [being the statutory corporation] is the person subject to the disclosure requirement; all the documents are discovered by it and are within its custody, power and control. The State is seeking to rely upon the immunity, not the PTTC, and the State is not subject to the disclosure requirements.""

32That approach was applied in Derbas at [8], in respect of a subpoena to produce addressed to the Registrar of the Local Court. Objection was taken by the Commissioner for Police who sought to intervene in the proceedings in the District Court. Meagher JA noted that on a question of production, s 130 did not in its terms apply and continued:

""Nor did s 131A operate to require the primary judge to determine the Commissioner's objection by applying the provisions of s 130. That is because s 131A only applies if the 'person' required to produce the document is 'the person' who objects to the provision of the document .... In State of New South Wales v Public Transport Ticketing Corporation ... the person producing documents by way of discovery (the Public Transport Ticketing Corporation) and the person making the claim for immunity (the State) were distinct juristic entities, with the result that ss 130 and 131A were not engaged. That is also the position here. The person producing the documents (the Registrar) and the person making the claim for immunity (the Commissioner) were not the same.""

33Approaching the present matter in the terms accepted in these two recent cases, a different result obtains. The subpoena was addressed to the Commissioner and it was the Commissioner who raised the objection. There was no objection in Derbas to the Commissioner raising the objection, as distinct from the State, and it may well have been that the Court in Derbas was satisfied that the Commissioner and the State were relevantly the same entity.

34Given the unity of the producer and the objector in the present case, it is not necessary to raise any question as to the correctness of those decisions, although whether they achieve a sensible result may be debated. Significantly, there was no reference to the terms of s 130(2) providing that the court might direct that the document not be adduced as evidence ""either on its own initiative or on the application of any person (whether or not the person is a party)"". This provision is consistent with the common law principle which allows an objection to be taken by a private person, whether witness, litigant or person subject to an order for production, and obliges the court to consider the issue for itself, and indeed to do so whether or not objection is raised: Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43; 142 CLR 1 at 44 (Gibbs ACJ), 58-59 and 68 (Stephen J), 100 (Mason J) referring to Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Co Ltd v The Commonwealth (No 2) [1913] HCA 19; 16 CLR 178 at 192 (Barton J) and 206 (Isaacs J). As it is clear that the person required to produce documents is entitled to object to such production on the basis of public interest immunity, s 131A(1) would be satisfied if such objection were taken. Public interest immunity is not a ""privilege"", as has long been recognised, and does not ""belong"" to any individual or entity, although in many cases an objection by a private individual without the support of the government of the day will fail: see, eg, Sankey v Whitlam. In any event, such matters do not affect the outcome in the present case, where the Commissioner was the recipient of the subpoena and the Commissioner objected to production. The Court was therefore required to determine the objection by application of s 130.

Applicable principles - Evidence Act, s 130
35Section 130, so far as presently relevant, provides:

""130 Exclusion of evidence of matters of state

(1) If the public interest in admitting into evidence information or a document that relates to matters of state is outweighed by the public interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to the information or document, the court may direct that the information or document not be adduced as evidence.
...
(4) Without limiting the circumstances in which information or a document may be taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to relate to matters of state, the information or document is taken for the purposes of that subsection to relate to matters of state if adducing it as evidence would:

...
(c) prejudice the prevention, investigation or prosecution of an offence, or
...
(e) disclose, or enable a person to ascertain, the existence or identity of a confidential source of information relating to the enforcement or administration of a law of the Commonwealth or a State, or
(f) prejudice the proper functioning of the government of the Commonwealth or a State.

(5) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to take into account the following matters:

(a) the importance of the information or the document in the proceeding,
(b) if the proceeding is a criminal proceeding - whether the party seeking to adduce evidence of the information or document is a defendant or the prosecutor,
(c) the nature of the offence ... or defence to which the information or document relates, and the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding,
(d) the likely effect of adducing evidence of the information or document, and the means available to limit its publication,
(e) whether the substance of the information or document has already been published,
(f) if the proceeding is a criminal proceeding and the party seeking to adduce evidence of the information or document is a defendant - whether the direction is to be made subject to the condition that the prosecution be stayed.""

36The next step in the Attorney's argument is that where non-production is necessary in order to protect the identity of the informant and the information disclosed by an informant, the only available exception is the public interest in preventing an accused person properly defending himself or herself against conviction. This principle has been differently expressed from time to time, but it is not necessary to consider such variations in language: compare Marks v Beyfus (1890) 25 QBD 494 at 498 (Lord Esher MR) and D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children [1978] AC 171 at 232 (Lord Simon of Glaisdale).

37Whether, even at common law, such a rule existed may be doubted. The importance of private informers to law enforcement has not diminished over the decades and, arguably, only the availability of reasonably watertight assurances, well founded in the law, can ensure the continued flow of such information. On the other hand, that principle cannot become a protection for unchallengeable and potentially malicious complaints which may lead to a wrongful conviction. Hence the exception where the court is satisfied that disclosure is necessary to avoid a wrongful conviction. However, clear applications of established principle do not demonstrate the absence of other forms of exception: they merely demonstrate the high value placed on the protection of informers.

38In practice, informers fall into different categories, as do the threats attendant upon disclosure. Each case must depend, to a certain extent, upon its own facts, although the importance of maintaining trust in the ability of a police force to offer protection to informers is a consideration of general application.

39Whatever may be the principle applicable under the general law, the test to be applied under s 130 is clearly a balancing exercise which requires the court to be satisfied that, relevant to the present circumstances, the public interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to a category of documents outweighs the public interest in their production. In undertaking that balancing exercise, the court is required to take into account those factors identified in sub-s (5) as are relevant in the circumstances of the case. That exercise is not to be constrained by unexpressed rules derived from the general law, although the same result may be expected on either approach.

Application of principles
40The present case had two notable aspects. First, the respondent had no doubt about the identity of Ms Brown; his suspicion was that she was a police informer. Thus he sought records of communications between her and the police in order to establish the correctness or otherwise of his suspicion.

41The second notable feature was that, as explained above, the police did not in fact object to production of documents apparently falling within the scope of the subpoena: rather, they produced the documents and objected to any person other than the Court having access to them. Accordingly, the respondent is now aware that there is a significant volume of communications falling within the category of documents pertaining to the relationship between the police and Ms Brown. 

42There may be an issue as to the precise scope of the term ""informer"", in this context. It is no longer used to refer to a person who lays an information against an offender and is paid by the State for so doing, although that was its meaning in the phrase ""common informer"". It is now used to refer to a person who gives information to the police, usually about criminal activity. The uses to which such information may be put is quite variable, depending on its nature.

43It is arguable that the mere fact that police have had a volume of communications with a particular individual does not mean that he or she is a police informer. The police may have engaged over a lengthy period in the strategy of seeking to obtain information from the person, only to be supplied with misinformation. On the other hand, as the further result of the condition of the stay, the respondent believes that some of the information contained in the documents may be of genuine forensic interest in relation to his sentencing proceedings. It is quite unlikely that such an inference would be drawn from documents which disclose that the relationship of Ms Brown with the police was other than that of an informer. That inference has arisen entirely as a result of the order made by way of conditional stay, upheld by this Court in the 2011 appeal.

44It is not the function of this Court to say whether the stay order made by Finnane DCJ was misconceived and whether the 2011 decision of this Court was wrong. However, the fact that the respondent can now establish certain inferences, at least on the balance of probabilities, is a factor to be weighed in the balance in considering whether the presently impugned disclosure order made in the District Court was erroneous.

45Three further matters should also be noted. First, although the Director indicated that some of the documents may be relevant to a matter of sentence of the respondent, he has not indicated what proportion of those sought fall into that category. It may be a large proportion or it may be quite a small proportion. Secondly, he has not stated how they may be relevant: they may demonstrate that the police were urging Ms Brown to encourage the respondent to sell larger and larger quantities of drugs, or they may reveal the reverse, or they may reveal nothing in this regard.

46Thirdly, the Director indicated a view that they were properly subject to a claim for public interest immunity. He did not express any view as to the basis of that claim. He may have assumed, for the purposes of the exercise, that the respondent did not know whether there had been any significant communications between Ms Brown and the police or the opinion may have been formed for reasons unrelated to the offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty. 

47Before identifying the reasons given by the primary judge for the order foreshadowed on 24 February 2012, it is necessary to note that passages in the reasons appear to reveal the contents of the documents sought to be protected. Despite an application by counsel for the Commissioner, in the sense already explained the reasons were not delivered in closed court. Further, as explained, subsequent remarks on the transcript which appear to reveal the contents of the protected documents were not delivered in closed court. Such conduct was singularly inappropriate and had the self-evident potential to subvert any possible appeal which might be sought in respect of the judgment. On the other hand, the judgment has not been uploaded to the internet, so far as this Court can tell, and the transcript would not be generally available. Nevertheless this Court should not extend the scope of such publication as may have occurred by setting out those disclosures.

48In summary form, the factors which appear to have persuaded the primary judge to make the disclosure order were as follows:

(a) the opinion of the Director that some documents may be relevant to the sentencing exercise;
(b) the fact that it might be inferred from the production of material that Ms Brown was an informer and was known to be such by the offender; and
(c) having read the produced material, he had formed the view that it was ""material which can be and should be shown to the offender's legal representatives because it is possible that it may assist them in some way in presenting their arguments on sentence"".

49The first factor was either irrelevant or of no weight; the second factor was by no means decisive and the third factor illustrated lack of attention to the appropriate legal test.

50In relation to the first point, the Director's opinion was both irrelevant and unhelpful. Indeed, the primary judge appears to have rejected it in part because he ignored the fact that it referred only to some of the documents viewed and not to the whole of the documents which the primary judge held should be released. Secondly, he ignored the Director's opinion that public interest immunity applied. Thirdly, he ignored the fact that the opinion only extended to the possibility of relevance, a matter which will be addressed further below.

51In relation to the second point, as already noted, to identify a person as an ""informer"" is to accord a label which may well have implications which are not intended and may or may not be supported by the true facts, if they were known. It certainly cannot, by itself, provide a basis for disclosure of communications, as opposed to removing a critical obstacle: cf Alister, 154 CLR at 469-470.

52The third point is, however, critical for present purposes and calls for analysis. Section 130 requires that the court undertake a balancing exercising involving two aspects of the public interest. On the one hand, there is the public interest in ""admitting into evidence information or a document"". The assumption underlying this element is that the document or information would otherwise be admissible. The importance of that consideration appears to have been obscured by the fact that the Courts were first invited to deal with the question of whether the respondent may have had a legitimate forensic purpose in seeking access to the documents, before dealing with the question of public interest immunity. Furthermore, it is not possible to carry out the balancing exercise by addressing the possibility that such material may be relevant to an issue at the sentencing hearing, without identifying the issue. That exercise was not undertaken, an omission which demonstrated error in the approach adopted.

53Importantly, it is an exercise which still cannot be undertaken. The forensic purpose relied upon by senior counsel for the respondent has been set out at [17] above. That explanation included three elements. The first was that the operation involving the undercover officer, which resulted in the respondent's arrest, ""involved ... a well known technique of ramping up the amounts of the drug until such time as the amounts in total supplied by the offender exceeded the large commercial limit"". The term ""ramping up"" has sinister connotations; what the facts as presently known to this Court indicate is that there were a number of supplies of cocaine over a period of some weeks and an arrest which followed when the total amount exceeded 1 kilogram. That set of circumstances was neutral as to whether the respondent had been willing, anxious or reluctant to supply further drugs at any particular point in time.

54The second element of the identified forensic purpose was described thus: ""[t]he precise point that Mr Lipton makes is that he got out of his depth and out of his league when the amounts got bigger but Melanie Brown was encouraging him to continue to deal with the undercover officer ..."". The language used may have been intended to be rhetorical; it may have reflected the respondent's current instructions to his counsel. However, at no stage had the respondent indicated any willingness or intention to give evidence along the lines of the statement. Submissions without a factual foundation would not raise a relevant issue at the sentencing hearing. This, indeed, was the reason why King DCJ originally set aside (relevantly for present purposes) paragraph 4 of the subpoena, a conclusion upheld by this Court in its 2010 decision. Nothing has changed since that time in this respect. The respondent is not bound to give evidence in accordance with the instructions he may have given to his counsel, and may not do so. There is no suggestion that anyone else could give such evidence on his behalf. Evidence that he was in a particular ""league"" would presumably involve admissions as to a prior course of dealing in drugs not yet the subject of any charges. One would not need to be unduly cynical to express doubt as to whether the respondent will ever give evidence to that effect.

55Thirdly, the fact that Ms Brown may have encouraged the respondent to trust the undercover officer could hardly provide a significant point in mitigation of sentence. It suggests that the respondent was not unwilling to supply drugs, but was wary about supplying drugs to people he did not trust and who might be undercover police officers. That aspect of counsel's statement should be disregarded.

56The fact that the primary judge accepted that material ""showing contact between her and police officers"" should be disclosed ""because it is possible that it may assist [the respondent's legal representatives] in some way in presenting their arguments on sentence"", suggests that no significant consideration was given to the use of the material in evidence or its precise relevance to any particular argument. How it could be used in argument if it were not tendered is unclear; the possibility of assistance ""in some way"" at the very least indicates that the weight to be given to disclosure must be low.

57On the other side of the scale, the primary judge was required to consider the public interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to any information supplied to the police in confidence. He was also required to consider whether, even if the person in question had been identified as ""an informer"", the release of all communications between that person and the police might not have a chilling effect in respect of future co-operation between prospective informers and police.

58Having assumed that Ms Brown had been identified as an informer and ""not a secret person"" (judgment, p 4), the primary judge largely restricted his further consideration of the public interest against disclosure by referring to the need to protect ""police methods"", a factor as to which he was sceptical and to which he gave little weight. That consideration did not adequately address the two points noted above.

Conclusions
59The relevant documentary material and confidential submissions with respect to it were supplied to this Court. The Attorney General expressly invited this Court to determine the question of immunity in the event that the Court found error on the part of the primary judge and set aside his orders. The purpose of that request appeared to be to preclude the need for any further debate on the issue in the District Court. In effect, the Attorney sought a finding that there was simply no material which would, in any possible circumstances, provide material assistance to the respondent with respect to mitigation of sentence.

60Given the period of time during which the respondent has been in custody awaiting sentence, the possible benefits from acceding to such a submission are attractive. However, there are difficulties inherent in the exercise.

61The principal difficulty may be illustrated by considering the circumstances of the undercover officer. If there had been any enticement of a kind sufficient to warrant a degree of mitigation of sentence, it might be expected that that would have come from the undercover officer. With respect to the relationship between the respondent and the undercover officer, their conversations were recorded. In his case, there is no doubt that any enticement was to be attributed to the law enforcement authorities. By comparison, the situation with respect to Ms Brown is quite different. Such records as there may be of communication between her and the police would not be records of communications between her and the respondent. A statement by a police officer as to what Ms Brown claimed to have said to the respondent or the respondent had said to her would give rise to different questions as to admissibility, relevance, reliability and weight.

62As noted above, the ""forensic purpose"" identified by counsel for the respondent is both fragile (in the sense that it may well be abandoned) and incomplete, in the sense that it is difficult to see how any statement made by Ms Brown to the respondent could assist in mitigation of his sentence unless he gave evidence that it had influenced him in some manner. If he did give such evidence of a particular statement at a particular time, that might affect the consideration which the Court would need to give to any documents which might be produced by the Commissioner and which might be relevant to that alleged enticement. Without knowing the detail of such reliance, there is a real risk that the Court might undertake an inspection of any documents produced and miss an arguable point. On the other hand, it might undertake the task in the manner in which the primary judge appears to have done and treat the mere possibility that the respondent could make some use of discovered material as sufficient to warrant its production and inspection. That would be to compound the error already identified. There is yet a further difficulty; if disclosure were declined in relation to some or all of the inspected material, the reasons would not be disclosed and the scope of the consideration might not be revealed in a way which would assist the respondent to know if a fresh application would be warranted.

63Accordingly, it is necessary to decline the invitation of the Attorney that this Court carry out that exercise. In truth, this Court is in no better a position than it was on the occasion of the 2010 appeal, when it upheld the setting aside of the subpoena.

64There is one further matter as to which the Court can provide some limited further assistance. It concerns the supposed disclosure that Ms Brown ""is an informer"". 

65There are occasions upon which that disclosure may be a necessary step in undertaking the balancing exercise required both under the general law and under s 130. Thus, in Alister, the High Court was fully cognisant of the fact that if it were to order that the Commonwealth produce documents recording communications concerning the applicants from Mr Seary to ASIO, it would in effect reveal the fact, or confirm the suspicion, that Mr Seary was an ASIO informer. In circumstances where it was known that Mr Seary was an agent and an informer and had been a most important prosecution witness at the murder trial of the applicants, Gibbs CJ was ""not persuaded that the public interest would be harmed by discovery of the fact (if it be a fact) that Seary had made reports to ASIO concerning the applicants"": at 415. Having reached that conclusion, he further held that it would be proper to require disclosure of the documents to the Court so that it could form an opinion as to whether they should be produced to the applicants: at 416.

66Had a different view been taken it would no doubt have been possible, and would have been possible in the present case, for the primary judge to have conducted a hearing in the presence of counsel for both parties at which the Commissioner could have been directed, pursuant to s 133, to disclose any documents which fell within the terms of a valid subpoena, for the inspection of the Court, but in circumstances where counsel would not be entitled to advise the respondent as to whether any documents had been produced. The fact that such information would not be disclosed would maintain confidentiality as to whether the person from whom communications were suspected of emanating was or was not a police informer.

67This case is not in the same category as Alister's case, in the sense that there is no question about the legitimacy of a conviction of the heinous crime of murder, the respondent having pleaded guilty. Nor is it a case where the documents relate to the credibility of a central prosecution witness; there is no suggestion that Ms Brown will be called at the sentencing hearing. Nor was it true when the subpoena issued to say of Ms Brown, as could be said of Mr Seary, that it was well known that he was an undercover agent, though not for whom he worked. On the other hand, it must be acknowledged that, due to the course taken by the police and by the courts after the first subpoena was set aside, the respondent is entitled to assume that Ms Brown had communications with police officers in relation to the offences for which he has pleaded guilty. 

68That fact, however, does not warrant disclosure of the content of those communications unless the respondent is able to demonstrate that they may be relevant to a real and not hypothetical issue with respect to his sentencing. It follows that, if such an issue is squarely raised, the sentencing court may be required to examine the documents to determine whether any is genuinely relevant and admissible, taking into account the matters of state, and particularly those identified in s 130(4)(c), (e) and (f). Thus, if the respondent gives evidence of a specific enticement which affected his conduct and it is not squarely admitted by the Director that the enticement emanated from the police, the Court will need to consider any relevant documents to see if they supply admissible evidence of that connection.

69For present purposes, it is sufficient that the Court make the following orders:

(1) Set aside any order made by Finnane DCJ in the District Court at the time of or consequent upon the judgment delivered on 24 February 2012 requiring the Commissioner of Police to produce and permit the respondent to have access to documents pertaining to the relationship between police and Ms Melanie Brown.
(2) Direct that if such documents are in the custody of the Court, they be returned to the Commissioner of Police.
(3) Direct that any further application for production of such documents be made by way of a fresh subpoena issued for that purpose.

70HOEBEN JA: I agree with Basten JA and the orders which he proposes.

71McCALLUM J: I agree with Basten JA.

2759725,R v Pratten (No 11) [2012] NSWSC 1674,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: I have two applications before me in relation to bail. The applications for bail relate to the period for an adjourned sentencing hearing. Mr Pratten, having been found guilty by a jury of seven counts of dishonestly obtaining by deception a financial advantage from the Commonwealth, is awaiting sentence. Those sentence proceedings will now occur either on 10 September 2012 or some time to be adjusted in relation to that.
	
	
	Whether I grant bail is a matter that requires consideration of the provisions of s 32 of the Bail Act 1978. I have dealt with these issues in relation to an application by the Crown on an earlier occasion for revocation of bail, that application being based upon a breach of the bail condition to be of good behaviour in that Mr Pratten did and has been charged with contravening a restraining order in relation to the disposal or dealing with property, being a boat. It seemed to me on the last occasion that the provisions of s 32(1)(b) of the Bail Act as it applies to Mr Pratten and the complicated factual scenario that is before the court on sentencing required his liberty to prepare his case appropriately.
	
	
	What has occurred in the meantime is that there has been a change of solicitor, there is an issue about Legal Aid funding, and new solicitors are required to become acquainted with the proceedings and the vast amount of detail. It seems from the position of Mr Pratten that he now is the only person who has continuity in terms of the trial and the sentencing proceeding, and his liberty to prepare the case is probably even more important.
	
	
	In those circumstances, I intend to continue bail. The reasons for the continuation were essentially confined to that aspect.
	
	
	The circumstances of the contravention of the restraining order gave me concern for a greater risk involved in attendance. It is for that reason that I imposed the reporting condition and the condition related to the passport of his daughter, that is the daughter of whom he has custody or that is staying with him.
	
	
	It seems to me from what has fallen in the proceedings today that nothing has changed in that regard. The need to tend to Mr Pratten's farm and his stock is accommodated by the condition that he can report either at Kings Cross or at Raymond Terrace, and I do not vary the conditions of bail, nor do I revoke them.
	
	
	The court makes no order as to bail.

		29 April 2016",2012-07-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759757,Magoulias v R [2012] NSWCCA 160,"Judgment

1ALLSOP P: On 2 December 2010 a jury in the District Court found the appellant guilty of two charges: count 1: that on 8 December 2009 he entered part of a building, a bathroom of a dwelling house at Bellevue Hill, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely an act of indecency, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 114 (1)(d); and count 2: that on the same day he did commit an act of indecency towards the complainant, a young woman of 24 years of age, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 61N(2).

2The appellant was also called up for bonds under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), ss 9 and 12. The bonds under s 9 related to four counts of possessing a prohibited drug under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and the bond under s 12 related to a six month suspended sentence for driving a vehicle recklessly or furiously in a manner and speed that was dangerous contrary to the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW).

3He was sentenced on 11 February 2011. The s 12 bond was revoked and he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months to commence on 11 February 2011 and to expire on 10 August 2011. On count 1, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years imprisonment to commence on 11 August 2011 and to expire on 10 August 2013 with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months to expire on 10 February 2015. On count 2, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months to commence on 11 February 2011 and to expire on 10 August 2011. The s 9 bonds were revoked and a conviction was recorded with no additional penalty under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 10A.

4The grounds of appeal were originally four, as follows:

""1.His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that the evidence of the complainant should be scrutinised with care;

2.His Honour erred in failing to discharge the jury on the ground that his comments as to the failure of the appellant to give or call any evidence effectively undermined those directions given as to the appellant's silence;

3.His Honour's summing up was unfair and unbalanced to the appellant;

4.In all the circumstances a miscarriage of justice occurred.""


Ground 1 was abandoned at the hearing of the appeal.

5The grounds of the application for leave to appeal against the sentence were as follows:

""1.His Honour erred in failing to give any or any sufficient weight to the applicant's mental condition;

2.The sentence was manifestly excessive.""


6For the reasons expressed below, the appeal against conviction should be allowed and the convictions quashed. Whilst that makes the application for leave to appeal against the sentence strictly unnecessary to deal with, the reasons below state why, if I be wrong about the conviction appeal, I would have granted leave to appeal and allowed the appeal on sentence on the ground of manifest excess. Those reasons are sufficient to explain why I would not order a retrial: the appellant has already spent time in custody that is a more than adequate reflection of a non-parole period (at least) that would reflect the criminality of what occurred.

7The appellant was engaged as a painter working on the exterior of a block of flats at Bellevue Hill. The complainant was a 24 year old woman who was staying in a flat in the block, which flat was occupied by her brother and his flatmate. The complainant had become aware of the painters on the day before. On the day in question (8 December 2009) she got up at about 10.30 am. She changed for the beach. Her brother and the flatmate had left for work earlier in the morning. Upon opening the blinds she saw a male person (who was the appellant) working on a ladder on the balcony. It was a hot day. She asked him if he would like some water. He said yes. She took him a mug of water. She then worked on her computer for a short period of time. The appellant then sought to strike up a conversation with the complainant. She then went into the bathroom to brush her teeth, before going to the beach. While brushing her teeth, the complainant said that she felt a presence and turned to her left towards the bathroom door. She said there was a male person, who was moving towards her with his penis out of his trousers. His eyes were directed down. She immediately shouted, ""What the fuck are you doing?"" There was no reply and she shouted, ""Get the fuck out, you sick mother fucker."" She said the person walked inwards a little more, blocking her in the bathroom. She pushed him back and moved past him into the hallway and from there said, pointing to the balcony, ""Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out."" He walked out and said, ""I just need to use the bathroom. I just needed to use the bathroom."" To which she said, ""Get the fuck out.""

8In her evidence, she said that she looked at his face first and that she noticed he had his penis out of his trousers when his eyes went down. He did not put his whole head down to look, he just gave an indication to look with his eyes. She said that his arm had a bit of movement and he was holding his penis in one of his hands and it was pointing at her. She could not say if it was erect or not.

9In cross-examination she said that it was both his eyes looking down and the movement in his arm that drew her attention to his penis. She was not sure which arm was moving. It all took a couple of seconds. The summary of the trial prepared by the Crown summarised aspects of the cross-examination as follows:

""The complainant agreed that she had made two or three statements. She made a statement on 8 December 2009. She said she was in shock on that day but she knew it was an important document. She agreed that she said in the statement 'He wasn't moving his hand while holding his penis' and that this was different to the evidence she had given. She agreed that she said in her statement, 'I looked down and saw him holding his penis in his left hand.' She didn't think her evidence was different because his face was there first and his eyes went down and she was noticing that there was movement in his arm at the same time. The complainant was asked whether she saw his arm moving or his hand moving and she responded: 'No he was holding it with his hand. He was - I was in shock, so basically, like, okay his eyes did that. His hand was there, and it's not like he was - like, you know, doing that fast or anything. It was sort of, like his hand was moving and penis was literally facing me, and he was taking steps forward towards me.' He maybe took a couple of steps toward her. He attempted to take steps forward and she couldn't tell exactly how many. She agreed that nowhere in her statement did it say that the man took steps toward her but she could swear that he did. She accepted that there are a few different things in her evidence from what she had put in her statement.""


10Grounds 2, 3 and 4 can be dealt with together as the parties did in their submissions. The essence of the complaint was that the judge delivered an unbalanced and unfair summing up to the jury. The matters in dispute went essentially to proof beyond reasonable doubt as to the appellant's intention. Relevant to that was the resolution of questions as to where he was standing, whether he was moving forward and whether his arm or hand was moving. These matters were relevant to the inferring of the relevant intent and could be seen as perhaps contradictory to the purpose expressed by him at the time, of wanting to go to the bathroom.

11It is unnecessary to set out all the summing up and directions. As a preliminary matter it is to be noted that nowhere in the directions was there any clear direction about proof beyond reasonable doubt of the necessary intention in the offences derived from inference from objective facts. That was important because the matters to which I have earlier referred - his position in the hallway or the bathroom, moving forward and whether his hand or arm was moving - were the subject of a degree of inconsistency in prior statements and in the evidence of the complainant. It was necessary to focus upon those inconsistencies in order that the jury properly attend to the drawing of factual conclusions about intent from relevant inferences. That process of fact finding did not turn on whether the complainant was truthful or on whether there was contrary evidence. (The appellant did not give evidence.) Rather, it required a dispassionate direction as to the possible inconsistencies in the versions the plaintiff had given and the need for the jury to address the question of the proof of intent from the objective circumstances, some of which were the subject of the inconsistencies.

12The summing up contained the following:

(a)The judge referred to the evidence of the complainant being in a unit. He said 'She has given evidence of that. There is no evidence to the contrary. As there is no evidence to the contrary it would be perverse to come to any conclusion other than ...'.

(b)The judge referred to evidence as to the appellant coming into the bathroom. He said, 'She has said she was in the bathroom. She has said that the accused came into the bathroom. There is no evidence to the contrary of that. She said he came into the bathroom. He has given no evidence. The fact that he has given no evidence means that he is exercising a right to give no evidence. If he gives no evidence, he does not add to the evidence which is given and the evidence which is given is that she was standing in the bathroom near the vanity basin and the accused came into the bathroom'.

(c)The judge reminded the jury of some cross examination of the complainant where he said, 'It was put to her that he merely stood on the carpet outside. She denied that. There is no evidence to the contrary. It follows then, that the only evidence is that the accused was in the bathroom'.

(d)The judge reminded the jury of the complainant's evidence as follows: 'She said the accused came towards her and was holding his penis in his hand ... Again, there is no evidence to the contrary of the fact that he came towards her while she was standing at the basin with his penis in his hand. There is no evidence that he was anywhere on a carpet outside the room holding his penis when he encountered her. The evidence is he was inside the unit. You must decide the case based on the evidence, not on suppositions. The question can be put as to some event, but it is not the question that is the evidence, it is the answer. So if there is a denial that something happened, there is no evidence of it'.

(e)Further, the judge told the jury that 'There is no evidence that he at any point attempted to cover his penis or hide his penis ... The only evidence is her evidence. Hers is the only evidence in the case as to what occurred in that bathroom'.

(f)In relation to intent, the judge told the jury as follows: 'How do you tell what his intention was? The only evidence that he had any intention of an innocent type comes from what the complainant herself has said'.

(g)Whilst the judge reminded the jury as to the accused's silence again, shortly after he also reminded the jury that 'the only evidence of the case as to what occurred was given by her as to what occurred in that unit'.

(h)As to intention, the judge again reminded the jury that 'The only way in which you can determine whether he had any innocent intention if you like comes from her evidence. The only way that you can determine whether he had any guilty intention comes from her evidence. It is only her evidence as to any intention on his part. There is no evidence of any other type from anybody about his intentions. It all depends on her. The mere fact that you do not like some part of her evidence does not mean she lacks creditability [sic] generally or she should be disbelieved.'


13The jury could only have been left with the impression that crucial to the finding of intent was the fact that the appellant did not give a contrary version and that the complainant's truthfulness was determinative. In fact, the case for the appellant had been that, because of the inconsistencies (such as they were) as to a small number of objective facts, one could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite intent. This did not depend on truthfulness, but doubt as to accuracy based on past inconsistencies about a very brief episode. This was not fairly put to the jury.

14The unbalanced nature of the summing up meant that the appellant did not receive a fair trial.

15The conviction should be quashed.

16The application for leave to appeal against sentence, therefore, does not strictly arise. It is necessary, however, to explain why I would not order a retrial.

17Even putting to one side the report of Dr Nielssen, the sentence was manifestly excessive. His Honour imposed the six month sentence concerning the reckless driving that had been the subject of the bond. The combined sentence for the two offences was imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years, the sentence of six months for count 2 being wholly concurrent with the penalty for count 1. His Honour found special circumstances. The assessment of the criminality involved includes the fact that this was opportunistic, occurring in a short time, with no actual or threatened violence. The indictable offence (in count 2) which he is taken to have been intending to commit for count 1 (an act of indecency) upon entering the building carries a maximum penalty of 18 months imprisonment. Considering the totality of the criminality involved, I can only conclude that this was an excessive response. This conclusion would be reinforced by the evidence of Dr Nielssen as to the probable chronic schizophrenia of the appellant.

18Because of my view as to the conviction appeal it is not necessary to re-sentence the appellant. Relevant, however, to any decision to put the appellant up for another trial is the fact that he has now served a custodial sentence referable to the principal offences as long as what I would consider to be the maximum possible non-parole period for the offence - about one year.

19The appellant has now served his sentence for the reckless driving offence, his bond under s 12 having been revoked. No additional penalty was imposed for the offences relating to the s 9 bonds, which were revoked. It is unnecessary therefore to deal with these matters in the orders.

20The orders that I would make are:

(1)Appeal against conviction allowed;

(2)Convictions on counts 1 and 2 on the indictment quashed.

21LATHAM J: I agree.

22DAVIES J: I agree.

		30 July 2012",2012-07-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759772,R v Won [2012] NSWSC 855,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HER HONOUR:  On 10 July 2012 the offender was convicted, after trial, of the manslaughter of Hyoung Mo Lee at Pendle Hill on 11 May 2010.  The jury acquitted him of the deceased's murder.  Although the jury were directed that a conviction of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act was open to them in the event that they were not satisfied that the Crown had proved an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, I am satisfied that the verdict of manslaughter was returned because the Crown was unable to exclude the reasonable possibility that the offender killed the deceased under provocation after the offender found him having sex with his wife in the bedroom of their home.  Counsel did not submit otherwise.
2The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter when he was indicted before the jury.  The Crown did not accept that plea in discharge of the indictment.  
3At the sentence hearing the Crown acknowledged that both prior to, and at the time of the committal proceedings, the offender had offered a plea of guilty to manslaughter (on the grounds of provocation) and that, consistent with what the Court has held in R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129, he was entitled to a discount on sentence for that reason.  In the circumstances of this case where, in final address, the Crown conceded that the offender had in fact lost his self-control, thereby seeking a verdict of guilty on the basis that the jury would be satisfied that an ordinary person in the position of the offender would not have lost his self-control as to have formed an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, I am satisfied a discount of 25 per cent on the sentence should be allowed. 
4The deceased died from blood loss within minutes of suffering a knife wound to the front of his upper left arm.  It penetrated to the surface of the bone, transecting two arteries, a major vein and a nerve.  Five other knife wounds were inflicted to his back, chest and abdomen, none of which would have proved fatal, assuming medical attention was administered.  That said, the wound to his abdomen was deep enough for the internal organs to protrude from the wound, and one of the wounds to the chest was deep enough to penetrate the lung, albeit to a minor degree.  
5Although the pathologist was unable to assign any order to the infliction of the six stab wounds, the evidence from the offender's wife suggests that the fatal wound was inflicted as the deceased raised his arm to defend himself after being stabbed in the abdomen and falling against a window in the bedroom, and that the balance of the wounds were inflicted in the lounge room after the deceased attempted to escape from the offender's knife attack and after her failed attempts to disarm her husband. 
6The offender and his wife were married in 1992.  Two children were born in 1993 and 1995.  It would seem the marriage was happy for a time but that they progressively became distant from one another, to the extent that they were sleeping apart as at the date of the killing, whilst maintaining the outward semblance of a marriage, largely, it would seem, for the sake of their children.  Mrs Won gave evidence that the sexual relationship with her husband had been unsatisfactory, from her perspective, for some time and that she became sexually involved with the deceased in an extramarital affair soon after meeting him in a Korean social club in 2008.  The offender met the deceased at the same time and they became friends.  Mrs Won said that aside from their poor sexual relationship and strained domestic life the offender was a loving, caring and gentle man who was a good provider for her and her children. 
7Mrs Won agreed that she maintained a separate mobile telephone in order that her relationship with the deceased would be maintained undetected and that this was done with the intention of deceiving her husband.  She gave evidence that at no time during the affair, or since the killing, did the offender ever tell her that he knew she was having the affair. 
8The deceased's wife, on the other hand, became aware of the affair after she discovered explicit photographs on her husband's mobile phone.  The deceased and his wife separated on 28 December 2009 after a violent argument in a car park, witnessed by the offender and his wife, when the deceased tried to stop his wife talking with Mrs Won about the photographs.  Mrs Lee said the offender helped her up off the ground and that she said to him ""You should know why I had to do this"".  She said that she did not tell the offender what she knew of the illicit affair because she did not want to shame him.  She agreed that although in the Korean community extramarital affairs are kept very private, others in the Korean community knew about the affair between Mrs Won and her husband.  She said she tried to call the offender a number of times between December and May but he did not return her calls.  She believed he wanted to keep his family together.  
9Mrs Won said she was embarrassed by the incident in the carpark.  She said when the offender asked her what the confrontation was about she deflected his enquires by accusing the deceased's wife of being overly suspicious.  
10The affair continued after the deceased's separation from his wife.  Mrs Won said in the weeks prior to the killing she persuaded her husband to allow the deceased to paint their house because he was short of money but that the offender was not very happy about it.   
11Both counsel advanced submissions concerning the findings of fact which would inform my assessment of the objective seriousness of the offender's conduct accepting that the verdict of the jury determines the characterisation in law of the unlawful killing.  In R v Alexander (1994) 78 A Crim R 141, in the context of manslaughter by provocation, Hunt CJ at CL identified three matters which the case law suggested had (to that date at least) been taken into account on sentence: (1) the degree of provocation offered (or, alternatively, the extent of the loss of self-control suffered), which when great has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence,
(2) the time between the provocation (whether isolated or cumulative in its effect) and the loss of self-control, which when short also has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence, and 
(3) the degree of violence or aggression displayed by the prisoner, which when excessive has the tendency of increasing the objective gravity of the offence.
12His Honour went on to observe that the second feature is in a practical sense no more than some evidence by which the degree of provocation might be judged.
13In R v Bolt [2001] NSWCCA 487; 126 A Crim R 284 Dowd J at [34] observed that there are logical, practical and legal inconsistencies in the consideration to be given to the features identified in Alexander.  Although his Honour recognised that as a matter of logic the degree of provocation (if high) must reduce the objective gravity of the offence and that the degree of violence employed (if great) would increase the objective gravity, there are cases where the degree of provocation is not great (the view I take of the present case) but the degree of violence or aggression involved in the killing is considerable (also my view of the present case), and cases where the converse also applies. 
14I do not understand that sentencing in cases of manslaughter committed under provocation requires ""a tick box approach"" to those matters identified by Hunt CJ at CL in Alexander.  What is essential is that all the features of the offending are taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness that has accompanied the unlawful taking of a human life. 
15In the present case, the objective features of the attack on the deceased which resulted in his death, while not of the same magnitude as the Court was considering in Bolt, nonetheless amounted to the infliction of serious violence accompanied by what I am satisfied was an intention to kill the deceased.  The offender's attack with a kitchen knife with a blade of 18 centimetres in length and about 4 centimetres wide at the hilt, was on any view sustained and persistent.  He first stabbed the deceased at least twice in the bedroom and then, as the deceased attempted to flee he was stabbed repeatedly in the lounge room where he bled to death.  It was at this time that the offender said words to the effect ""I'll kill him"" or ""He must die"" and said, somewhat rhetorically, ""Shall I kill you too"" because of Mrs Won's attempts to stop him.
16While on one view the wound to the deceased's arm was an unusual site for a fatal wound, the fact that it was inflicted after the deceased sustained a serious stab wound to the abdomen satisfies me that it was sustained when the knife was being aimed at the deceased's upper body, and under force, and that it was only deflected as the deceased raised his arm.  Although there is no evidence of what the offender said at the time of inflicting that wound, what he said as the attack continued in the lounge room persuades me that his intention throughout the sustained attack on the deceased was not just to inflict really serious injury, but to kill him. 
17There is an additional feature of the offending the subject of conflict on the evidence which needs to be resolved by me in order to make a final assessment of the gravity of the deceased's provocative conduct. 
18The offender gave evidence that he was provoked into killing the deceased - a man he knew and with whom he claimed to have had a close friendship - when, after becoming ill at work, and on coming home to collect his wallet containing his Medicare card and credit card en route to the doctor, he found the deceased having sex with his wife.  He claimed he had no reason to suspect that the deceased and his wife were having an affair.  
19The competing factual scenario contended for by the Crown at trial and a finding I would need to make beyond reasonable doubt for sentencing purposes, was that the offender left work before 9am because of his suspicions about his wife's fidelity and the deceased's loyalty to him as a friend, and not because of illness or the need to go home and collect his wallet before seeing a doctor.  The Crown submitted that I would be satisfied that the offender parked his car around the corner from his house so as to approach his home without warning to see whether his suspicions were well founded and not because of fear of falling debris damaging his car were he to park it at the front of his house.  The Crown also submitted that logic and common sense would dictate that were he to drive into the driveway of his house he would have avoided the risk of damage entirely and the more so when, on his own evidence, he was only stopping at his house to collect his wallet before going directly to the doctor.  The Crown also submitted that I would be satisfied that when the offender found his wife's car was in the garage and concluded that she was not at work as she was scheduled to be, and that the deceased was not painting the outside of the house as he was expected to be, he let himself into the house, took a knife from the kitchen and headed to the bedroom, perhaps to threaten to harm the deceased (or his wife, or both), or perhaps with no crystallised purpose of any kind other than to present the knife in a show of strength.  
20Even on this scenario it should be emphasised that it was not the Crown case at trial that the offender acted with premeditation or that he armed himself with the knife with the intention of harming the deceased (or his wife), or at that time intending to kill the deceased.  To the contrary, the Crown conceded at trial (a concession maintained on sentence), that the offender lost control whilst armed with the knife and he formed the intention of killing the deceased only when he was confronted with the stark reality of the sexual relationship between his friend and his wife, and that it was then that he lost his ability to control his reactions or response and used the knife with murderous intent. 
21It is not necessary to refer to the evidence in any great detail to resolve this issue.  The evidence at trial relied upon by the Crown came from the offender's wife and a neighbour who saw the offender park his car around the corner and retrieve it later and the arresting police to whom the offender made full admissions to the killing of the deceased.  
22Mrs Won gave evidence that she was having sex in her son's bedroom when the deceased said he heard a click (she said she did not hear it).  She said she then noticed a shadow in the corridor so she pushed the deceased away from her.  She said that the deceased was standing next to the bedroom door when she saw her husband come in through the door.  She said she did not see anything he was holding in his hand then all of a sudden he started stabbing the deceased.
23The offender also gave evidence.  He told police that he came home from work, discovered the deceased and his wife having sex; that they did not notice him at the bedroom door; that he went and got a knife from the kitchen and he stabbed the deceased in the bedroom and then followed him and stabbed him again.  He then said he put the knife in the washing basin and went to the kitchen and had a drink of wine.  He said the deceased was a family friend and he did not want him to die. 
24In his evidence at trial the offender said that he came home from work because of illness and that he parked around the corner partly out of habit and to avoid damage to his car and that he always removed his shoes on entering the house.  The offender gave evidence, supported by evidence from other Korean witnesses called in his case, that removing footwear is a Korean custom that is adhered to irrespective of the period of time that a person is inside the home or their purpose in entering.  His work colleagues supported his evidence that he left work that morning because he claimed he was ill.  They also gave evidence of his good character which was not in dispute.  The character evidence was relied upon to support the truth of his account that he left work because of illness. 
25In my view, the fact that the offender did not announce his arrival when he entered the house, or call out to see where his wife or the deceased might be inside the house, perhaps engaged in some innocent activity weighs against accepting his account as truthful.  Of less weight was the fact that he removed his footwear on entering despite the fact that on his evidence he was only intending to collect his wallet from the shelving in the hall and go directly to the doctor.  It is, however, not insignificant as I see it that the offender had his wallet in his pocket when he was arrested by police.  There was no evidence as to whether the wallet also held the cards the offender claimed to be intent on retrieving for his doctor's appointment.  
26The offender also gave evidence that he retrieved his wallet from the shelving in the hallway after killing the deceased.  He also gave evidence that again after regaining his self-control and before the arrival of the police he collected the car and parked it in the garage.  He said he did this also having accepted that he would be taken into custody for killing the deceased. 
27In so far as the question when the offender got the knife, Mrs Won' s evidence to the effect that he must have had it when she saw him at the doorway of the bedroom satisfies me that, contrary to the offender's evidence, he did not leave and return with the knife before launching his attack on the deceased but had the knife with him as he approached the bedroom.
28In short, I do not consider the offender's account of his actions on the day of the killing as a reasonably possible version of events in all respects.  I expressly reject his evidence that he had no suspicions of his wife's infidelity or the deceased's disloyalty to him.  Although he told workmates that he was ill and needed to attend a doctor, not only did he give inconsistent accounts of his medical complaints but his conduct thereafter is, in my view, inconsistent with any medical urgency and wholly consistent with what the Crown contended were his true motivations, namely seeking to see whether his suspicions as to his wife's infidelity were well founded and, if so, to expose her.  I place particular weight on the offender parking the car distant from his house and then entering soundlessly, arming himself with the knife in the process.  This satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that he did suspect his wife's infidelity and that the deceased was her lover, and that while he had no premeditated plan to avenge his position as her husband with violence, he did plan to expose them and that when he was confronted by their sexual activity he lost his self-control and killed him.
29On the basis of those findings, his loss of self-control and the formation of his intention to kill the deceased must be regarded as immediate and relatively short lived, thereby explaining the arrangements he made for his family by offering $3000 in cash in his wallet to his wife and retrieving his car before the police arrived coupled with his unqualified admissions to police at the house and his expressed remorse at the time.  Whilst I am obliged to accept that the offender did lose his capacity to exercise self-control I do not regard the degree of provocation presented by the deceased engaged as he was in sexual activity with the offender's wife as grave even allowing for some build up of suspicion due to the unhappy state of his marriage and his strained marital relations.  There is no evidence to suggest any taunting by the deceased or any overt slight at the offender's sexual prowess or masculinity.  However confronting and upsetting proof of infidelity might prove to be when it is exposed, where a marriage or other relationship is unhappy (as I am satisfied this marriage was), regrettable though it might be, a lack of fidelity is not uncommon.  While the identity of his wife's lover as a person who he regarded as a friend added to the offender's general upset, I do not regard this as adding materially to the degree or extent of provocation for sentencing purposes.
30In summary, I am satisfied that the death of the deceased was accompanied by an intention to kill and was the result of a sustained and determined attack delivered with considerable violence.  Although the degree of provocation was obviously sufficient for the jury to be satisfied that the offender lost his self-control (albeit only for a short time), and for them to be satisfied that the Crown had not removed the reasonable possibility that an ordinary person in the offender's position may have lost self-control, I am of the view that for sentencing purposes the degree of provocation was not such as to reduce the objective gravity of the offending to any significant degree.  I am also of the view that the degree of violence reflects the need for the sentence to denounce the offender's conduct that resulted in a loss of life and to provide some measure of general deterrence.   
31That is not to say that this case does not engender a degree of sympathy for the offender.  For my part, I recognise the weight of moral responsibility he will bear for the death of the deceased and the permanent loss of family life that he has suffered as a consequence.  It is in cases such as these that the remarks of Street CJ in Hill v R (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402, where he described sympathy for an offender as a manifestation of a humanitarian tendency that must be attended by the utmost caution, have particular resonance.  He went on to say:...It can be seen to be constantly written in the decision of the courts and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party.
The offender's subjective circumstances 
32The offender gave evidence that he was born in Korea in 1956 and is one of four children.  He spent time as a conscript in the Korean army before travelling to Bahrain where he obtained work in a steelyard.  He arrived in Australia in 1985 and acquired citizenship in 1993.  He married the same year.  His children, who now reside with his wife, are aged 16 and 19. He has a maintained relationship with them.  His relationship with his wife is likely to be the subject of divorce proceedings initiated by her once the criminal proceedings have concluded. 
33He has had various jobs including as a fruit and vegetable shop keeper in Chatswood before travelling to Western Australia where he acquired work as a boilermaker.  He commenced work with S and L Steel in 1999 and has worked full-time since then.  He has the ongoing support of his employer who has offered him work on his release.  
34He operated a small business in 2009 where he paid welders to do welding jobs for which he earned extra income.  Between his full-time work and his small business he was working seven days a week.
35On any view he was a hard-working person who provided well for his family and he was of an exemplary character.
36He gave no evidence as to his attitude to his marriage or his sexual relationship with his wife.  He did however tell arresting police that he loved her. 
37I am satisfied that the offender's rehabilitation is well advanced after two years in pre-trial custody and that his remorse is genuine and ongoing.  There is no need in these circumstances for the sentence to provide for personal deterrence.  While I am satisfied that the offender is not likely to react violently in the future, an extended period on parole will ensure his reintegration into the community and that, without the mainstay of family life to support him, he will benefit from the support of the parole service and related community agencies.  The Crown prosecutor agreed that a finding of special circumstances was warranted in this case justifying the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and balance of term otherwise provided for in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 being disturbed.
Sentence
38Joachim Won, I sentence you to imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months to date from 11 May 2010.  I impose a non-parole period of 5 years expiring on 10 May 2015 and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 10 November 2017.

		03 August 2012",2012-08-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759775,Cargnello v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] NSWCCA 162,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 8 September 2009 the appellant was convicted of seven counts of importation of child pornography, contrary to Customs Act 1901 (Cth), four counts of encouragement of sexual intercourse with a child under 16 years outside Australia, contrary to Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 50DB, and one count of use of the internet to access child pornography, contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth). The prosecutor did not establish the identity of the persons encouraged to engage in sexual intercourse and it was assumed that they were not Australian citizens or residents.

On 21 December 2009 the appellant was sentenced by Toner DCJ in the District Court to a non-parole period of four years, commencing on 8 September 2009 and expiring on 7 September 2013, with a balance of term of two years, six months.

On appeal, the appellant challenged his convictions for all the offences. He submitted that for the purposes of s 50DB the person encouraged to engage in sexual intercourse outside Australia must be an Australian citizen or resident; that the trial judge erred in refusing to direct the jury to acquit if the evidence of an alibi might reasonably have been true; that his counsel at trial should have been permitted to split the closing address, and that the trial judge's direction in relation to tendency evidence was erroneous. 

The appellant sought leave to appeal against his sentences in relation to the offences of encouragement of sexual intercourse.

The issues for determination on appeal were:

(i) whether, for the purposes of Crimes Act, s 50DB, the person encouraged to engage in sexual intercourse must be an Australian citizen or resident,
(ii) whether the trial judge erred in refusing to give a direction as to the defendant's alibi,
(iii) whether defence counsel should have been permitted to split the closing address,
(iv) whether the trial judge's direction in relation to the tendency evidence was erroneous, and
(v) whether the trial judge erred in sentencing in relation to the offences of encouragement of sexual intercourse.

The Court held (per Basten JA, Price and S G Campbell JJ agreeing), dismissing the appeal:

In relation to (i)

1. While Crimes Act, s 50AD provided that a person who was not an Australian citizen or resident could not be charged with engaging in sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 16 years overseas, it was not an element of s 50DB that the recipient of the encouragement be an Australian citizen or resident: [24]-[29]

XYZ v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 25; 227 CLR 532 applied, Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137; 199 ALR 1 referred to.

In relation to (ii)

2. The evidence that the appellant was aware of the existence and nature of the child pornography on his computer might well have been regarded by the jury as overwhelming. None of the appellant's witnesses gave any evidence of knowledge of the material on the computer and there was no evidence that any of them manipulated the material. The absence of a direction in relation to the evidence that the appellant did not have access to his computer at specific times could not have caused a miscarriage of justice: [36]-[37]

3. In circumstances where the appellant did not request a redirection, and the grounds of appeal are inconsistent with the manner in which the trial was run, leave under Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), r 4 to raise these grounds should be refused: [37]

In relation to (iii)

4. The appellant's counsel did not make an application to split the defence address. There was no suggestion that the refusal of the prosecutor to consent to a split defence address gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. Leave to raise this ground, pursuant to Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), r 4, should be refused: [41]

In relation to (iv)

5. It was not clear what precise direction would have assisted the jury in relation to the tendency evidence. The evidence was not highly prejudicial. No miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated and leave to raise this ground should be refused: [50]-[51]

In relation to (v)

6. No allowance in sentencing should be made for extra-curial punishment that will be common to all offenders subject to custodial sentences. It is not generally appropriate that wealthy or well-known offenders should receive lesser sentences because they have more to lose as a result of conviction. It is also necessary to distinguish between consequences for the offender and consequences for his or her family and associates: [60]

Einfeld v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 referred to.

7. There was no error of principle nor unreasonableness in the sentencing judge taking into account, in the appellant's favour, half of the delay between arrest and trial: [65]

8. At least in some circumstances it is likely that encouragement of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 16 years will be at a higher level of culpability where it can be shown that the conduct did occur. However, the number of persons encouraged and the specificity with which a victim was identified will also be relevant to sentence. There were factors in the present case that might be thought to diminish the seriousness of the offence. However, the sentence period was not in aggregate excessive: [66]-[68], [99]-[91]

R v Wicks [2005] NSWCCA 409; R v Percival [2001] NSWCCA 429; R v Pearson [2005] NSWCCA 116; Kaye v The Queen [2004] WASCA 227 discussed, R v Ruppert (unrep, County Court of Victoria, 19 August 1998) distinguished, R v Van Der Zyden [2012] QCA 89 disapproved.

9. By imposing separate, wholly concurrent and identical sentences for offences involving common elements, the sentencing judge erred by sentencing the appellant more than once for those common elements: [92]-[94]

Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616, R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 applied, R v Knight [2005] NSWCCA 253; 155 A Crim R 252; R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255; 174 A Crim R 100; Porter v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 145 referred to.




			Judgment

1BASTEN JA: In August and September 2009 the appellant stood trial in relation to 12 counts on an indictment alleging two main groups of offences against Commonwealth law. Counts 1-7 alleged importation of child pornography on or about 31 August 2006 in contravention of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). Counts 8-11 alleged conduct which had occurred over six years earlier, in March 2000, involving encouragement of sexual intercourse with a child under 16 years of age outside Australia, contrary to s 50DB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Count 12 alleged use of the internet to access child pornography, between March 2005 and August 2006, contrary to Criminal Code (Cth) and related to conduct the subject of the first group of counts.

2On 8 September 2009 the appellant was convicted by a jury on all counts. On 21 December 2009 he was sentenced by Judge Toner in the District Court to a non-parole period of four years, commencing on 8 September 2009 and expiring on 7 September 2013. The balance of the term was two years, six months, giving a total sentence of six years, six months imprisonment.

3By a notice of appeal dated 10 December 2010, the appellant challenged his conviction on counts 8-11 and also his sentence on those counts. On the same day (10 December 2010) the appellant filed written submissions in support of his conviction appeal and his application for leave to appeal against sentence. During 2011 the appellant filed further written submissions. On 13 January 2012 the appellant filed amended grounds of appeal together with a fourth set of written submissions. The hearing of the appeal took place on 28 June 2012. Although the delay was not explained, senior counsel for the appellant accepted that the lapse of time was not the responsibility of either the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Court.

4The delay might have been significant: the sentences on all counts other than counts 8-11 expired on 7 March 2012. Any non-parole period fixed in respect of those convictions would likely have expired before the amended grounds of appeal were filed. In the event, the lapse of time has not caused prejudice as, for the reasons given below, the conviction appeals should be rejected.

5As the proceedings involved contraventions of Commonwealth law, both the trial and the proceedings in this Court involved the exercise of federal jurisdiction. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) apply as federal law, pursuant to the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 68(1)(d) and (2). As will appear, the appellant's initial conviction appeal in respect of counts 8-11 involved a question of law only and did not require leave: Criminal Appeal Act, s 5(1). Ground 2 (unreasonable verdicts) was not pressed. Grounds 3-6 did not involve questions of law only and were matters in respect of which it is not appropriate to grant leave to appeal. It is appropriate that there be a grant of leave to appeal against the sentence on counts 8-11.

Counts 8-11: conviction appeal
6On 31 August 2006, the appellant was intercepted at Sydney International Airport, returning on a flight from Vancouver, Canada. Customs officers seized a laptop and digital video recorder. They located on these items images involving child pornography and child abuse. They also located a volume of emails dating from 1999. Counts 8-11 involved four particular emails sent by the appellant (as the jury accepted) to two email addresses. The identity of the recipients was not established and accordingly it should be assumed for the purposes of the legal argument that neither was a citizen or resident of Australia. The emails discuss places in Bangkok, Phnom Penh and Costa Rica where girls under 16 years of age could be located for the purposes of sexual activity. The jury verdict, which was not challenged in respect of these facts, demonstrated that the prosecution had proved that the emails were sent by the appellant with the intention of encouraging conduct which would constitute engaging in sexual intercourse with a person who was under 16.

7The legal issue raised by the first ground of appeal was whether the elements of the offence required proof of that which, by concession, was not established, namely that such conduct outside Australia was to be committed by a citizen or resident of Australia. 

8At the time of the alleged offending, the statutory provisions relevant to counts 8-11 were contained in Part IIIA of the Crimes Act. Part IIIA was repealed with effect from 15 April 2010 by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Offences Against Children) Act 2010 (Cth), the equivalent provisions now being found in the Criminal Code (Cth). In March 2000, the relevant offence was found in s 50DB of the Crimes Act, which read:

""50DB Encouraging offence against this Part

(1) A person contravenes this section if:

(a) the person does an act, or makes an omission, whether within or outside Australia, with the intention of encouraging conduct of a kind that would constitute an offence against this Part (other than this section); and
(b) the act or omission is reasonably capable of encouraging such conduct;

whether or not that conduct in fact occurs.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 17 years.

(2) In this section:

encourage means:

(a) encourage, incite to, or urge, by any means whatever, for example, by written, electronic or other form of communication; or
(b) aid, facilitate, or contribute to, in any way whatever.

(3) These are examples of acts covered by paragraph (1)(b):

(a) organising an arrangement that facilitates an offence against this Part (other than this section);
(b) assisting a person to travel outside Australia in order to commit an act that would constitute an offence against Division 2;
(c) advertising an offer so to assist a person or an arrangement for so assisting a person.""

9Division 1 of Part IIIA was entitled ""Preliminary"" and contained a number of definitions, to which reference will be made in due course. Division 2, headed ""Sexual offences against children overseas"" set out four primary provisions of which the first, s 50BA, which was relied on in the present case, provided:

""50BA Sexual intercourse with child under 16

(1) A person must not, while outside Australia, engage in sexual intercourse with a person who is under 16.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 17 years.""

10Division 3 is headed ""Defences"" and included, for example, a belief that the victim was over 16, or that the accused and the victim were married: ss 50CA and 50CB respectively.

11Division 4 contained two sections of which one was s 50DB, set out above, the other being s 50DA, the operative part of which was structurally the same as s 50DB, with the variation that in place of the intention ""of encouraging"" the relevant conduct, it referred to the intention ""of benefiting, whether financially or not, from"" conduct similarly described, although without the words in parenthesis in s 50DB(1)(a) excluding an offence under the section itself.

12The language of s 50DB(1)(a) was attended by an element of uncertainty which founded the appellant's submissions in respect of ground 1. The conduct was identified by use of the subjunctive mood, ""would constitute"", which invoked a contingent or hypothetical element. On one view, the contingency was merely that the conduct might or might not occur. The alternative view was that the conduct which might or might not occur was conduct which would constitute an offence. The appellant argued for the second reading, with the further element that to be an offence under Part IIIA the act must be committed by a person who could be charged with and convicted of the relevant offence. 

13To explain the different approaches it is necessary to refer back to the offences in Division 2. In respect of three counts the relevant offence was that under s 50BA, set out at [9] above. (The fourth count related to an act of indecency on a person under 16, which would be an offence under s 50BC, but that variation does not affect the present argument.) In its terms, s 50BA appeared to create an offence by any person in any place in the world, other than Australia. The appellant submitted that it could not be so understood and, indeed, was not so intended. That conclusion relied on the provision in Division 1, s 50AD, which limited those who could be prosecuted: 

""50AD Who can be prosecuted for an offence committed overseas

A person must not be charged with an offence against this Part that the person allegedly committed outside Australia unless, at the time of the offence, the person was:

(a) an Australian citizen; or
(b) a resident of Australia; or
(c) a body corporate incorporated by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or
(d) any other body corporate that carries on its activities principally in Australia.""

14Reading ss 50AD and 50BA together, the appellant submitted that, despite the apparent breadth of s 50BA, it only created an offence for the purposes of the Part where, although the conduct must occur outside Australia, the offender was an Australian citizen or a resident of Australia. 

15In order to evaluate this submission, it is necessary to place s 50DB in its statutory context. Generally speaking, aiding and abetting, encouraging and inciting refer to forms of ancillary culpability involving a derivative responsibility for the crime committed by another. These kinds of responsibility were reflected in ss 5 (aiders and abettors), 6 (accessory after the fact) and 7A (inciting to or urging the commission of offences) in Part IA of the Crimes Act. There was a qualified adoption of those provisions in Part IIIA by virtue of the following parts of s 50AA:

""50AA General

(1) In this Part:
...

offence, in the case of a reference to an offence against this Part or against a particular provision of it, has a meaning affected by subsections (2) and (3) of this section.
...

(2) A reference in this Part (except section 50DB) to an offence against this Part or against a particular provision of it includes:

(a) a reference to:

(i) an offence against section 6, 7 or 50DB ...
...

that relates to an offence against this Part or against that provision of it; and

(b) a reference to an offence against this Part, or against that provision of it, because of section 5.

(3) A reference in section 50DB to an offence against this Part or against a particular provision of it does not include a reference to such an offence because of section 5.

(4) Section 7A does not apply to an offence against this Part.""

16Section 50DB was thus substituted for the operation of ss 5 and 7A in respect of offences against Part IIIA. The Director asserted that the structure of these provisions revealed an important characteristic of s 50DB, namely that it did not involve any form of derivative liability but imposed direct responsibility for the kind of conduct which might otherwise have been caught by ss 5 and 7A. There was, therefore, a deliberate abandonment of the language of aiding and abetting ""the commission of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth"" (language that occurs in both s 5 and s 7A) and replacement with encouraging ""conduct of a kind that would constitute an offence"", not against any law of the Commonwealth, but against Part IIIA. On this approach, the particular conduct, ""of a kind that would constitute an offence"", picking up s 50BA, was engaging in sexual intercourse outside Australia with a person who was under 16. While a person who was not an Australian citizen or a resident of Australia could not be charged with such conduct, the conduct itself was not limited by reference to the nationality or residence of the person. The critical connection in s 50DB(1) was with ""conduct"" having the specified characteristics in s 50BA, and not with a person having a characteristic specified in s 50AD.

17The appellant resisted that construction as being contrary to the understanding of the operation of Part IIIA adopted by the High Court when considering its constitutional validity in XYZ v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 25; 227 CLR 532. That case was concerned specifically with offences under what were, in 2000, ss 50BA and 50BC. An interlocutory challenge to the validity of those provisions was mounted on the basis that they were not supported by s 51(xxix) of the Constitution, as laws with respect to external affairs. For that purpose, Gleeson CJ identified the provisions in the following terms, at [2]:

""Sections 50BA and 50BC of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) respectively make it an offence for a person, while outside Australia, to engage in sexual intercourse with a person under sixteen, or to commit an act of indecency on a person under sixteen. By virtue of s 50AD, the first-mentioned 'person' relevantly means a person who was, at the time of the offence, an Australian citizen or a resident of Australia.""

18The Chief Justice continued at [4]:

""No issue of statutory construction arises. That the legislation has, or purports to have, extra-territorial effect is clear. In terms, it relates to conduct outside Australia, but is limited in its operation to the conduct of Australian citizens or residents.""

19The circumstances of the case, as noted by Gleeson CJ at [3], were that the accused was an Australian citizen and that the offences were said to have been committed in Thailand. The alleged victim was neither a citizen nor a resident of Australia. Given that his Honour did not consider there to be a relevant question of statutory construction involved, the comments set out above may be understood to reflect the circumstances of the case in which the question of constitutional validity arose. 

20In a joint judgment, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ spoke of the issue to be determined in the following way at [49]:

""The Commonwealth correctly submitted that legislation proscribing conduct engaged in outside Australia, such as ss 50BA and 50BC of the Crimes Act, is supported by the external affairs power. That is so without the further requirement, here imposed by s 50AD, that the person alleged to have committed the offence outside Australia must be an Australian citizen or a resident of Australia.""

21That language is consistent with the manner in which the issue was earlier addressed at [31] (in the joint judgment) and at [74] by Kirby J. On the other hand, Kirby J also referred to the fact that the plaintiff's Australian citizenship ""afforded a clear connection between the plaintiff and the subject matter of the federal law"": at [133].

22In these circumstances, it is arguable that both Gleeson CJ and Kirby J placed some weight upon the connection with Australia, for the purposes of a prosecution. However, the Court was not concerned with the operation of s 50DB and, pursuant to that provision, the same connection was required between the putative offender and Australia: that is, if the act were done outside Australia, the person could not be charged unless he or she was a citizen or resident of Australia. Accordingly, there was nothing in XYZ which was inconsistent with the Director's construction of s 50DB.

23Even accepting that to be so, the appellant submitted that there was uncertainty as to whether the constraint in s 50AD should apply to the characterisation of the conduct referred to in s 50DB as well as to the capacity to prosecute the person sought to be encouraged. In other words, if the encouragement or incitement were to take place in a European country, by a person organising sex tours of a South East Asian country, not only should the alleged offender be a citizen or resident of Australia, but so should the target audience. It is unlikely, the appellant contended, that an Australian citizen in Europe, organising a trip for non-Australians to South East Asia for sex with young persons under the age of 16, would have been intended to be caught by such a provision. By contrast, an Australian citizen in Europe seeking to organise a trip for fellow Australians to go to South East Asia was an entirely plausible reading of the provision. At the very least, the submission proceeded, in circumstances where the language was ambiguous or doubtful, the ambiguity or doubt should be resolved in the favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences, in accordance with the reasoning of Gibbs J in Beckwith v The Queen [1976] HCA 55; 135 CLR 569 at 576.

24The degree of uncertainty in the present case is not sufficient to invoke such a principle. There are three primary reasons for adopting that conclusion. The first is that s 50DB, being a provision imposing direct liability for conduct of a particular kind, which did not depend on whether an offence was committed by another person, should not be read down by reference to the possibility that a particular person could not have been prosecuted for such an offence if it were committed.

25Secondly, the focus of the provision was the discouragement of persons in Australia, or Australian citizens and residents outside Australia, encouraging child sex tourism. As the section made clear, the conduct might not take place and, it should be accepted, the encouragement might have been directed to a general audience, without the need to determine where in the world they were resident, nor whether they were Australian citizens. The fact that the encouragement might be directed to an individual (as it was in this case) did not mean the prohibition was so restricted. The attraction of the appellant's submissions diminished once that factor was recognized.

26Thirdly, that ss 50BA and 50BC could only relate to conduct outside Australia, but were defined without reference to the citizenship or place of residence of the person committing the offence, was clearly recognised in the joint judgment in XYZ, in upholding the validity of those provisions. The interrelationship of those provisions with s 50AD did not lead to a different conclusion. Section 50AD limited those who could be prosecuted for such an offence, but did not limit the scope of those offences. Other offences in Part IIIA involved conduct which could occur within or outside Australia, including s 50DB itself. Again, the effect of the section was not to prevent such conduct as might be committed outside Australia from being an offence, if not committed by a citizen or resident of Australia.

27This conclusion receives further support from the operation of s 50DA, dealing with those seeking to benefit from conduct of the kind that would constitute an offence against Part IIIA. Such conduct may itself be carried out within or outside Australia, but, assuming it were carried out within Australia, it is difficult to find that it was only intended to render such conduct an offence if the conduct from which the benefit was sought to be obtained involved sexual activity by citizens or residents of Australia in an overseas country. If such a limitation were not to be imposed on those acting with intent to benefit, the similar structure of s 50DB resists such a limitation with respect to the offence of acting within intent to encourage.

28Finally, some limited further support may be obtained from the heading of the Part, namely ""Child sex tourism"". That heading appeared as the heading of a Part ""appearing before the first section of the Act"", that is, in the table of contents, and thus forms part of the Act: Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 13(2). That title is at least consistent with the purpose of the Act being to criminalise various forms of conduct having a relevant connection with exploitation of children in other countries. It thus confirms the purpose which is otherwise to be inferred from the language of Part IIIA, read as a whole: cf Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137; 199 ALR 1 at [137] (Allsop J).

29It follows that it was not an element of the offences identified in counts 8-11 that the recipient of the encouragement be a citizen or resident of Australia who would, if the offences were committed, be liable to prosecution under Part IIIA for the sexual activity. Ground 1 must therefore be rejected.

Other counts: conviction appeal
(a) grounds 3 and 4 - access to laptop
30Grounds 3 and 4, as set out in the amended grounds of appeal filed on 13 January 2012, were as follows:

""Ground 3. His Honour erred in failing to direct the Jury that, if the evidence given by the appellant's witnesses (to the effect that the appellant did not have access to the relevant laptop when the material was said to have been downloaded on to that laptop) might reasonably have been true, then the jury was required to acquit the appellant in relation to counts 1-2 and 12.

Ground 4. Due to his Honour's failure to direct the jury as set out in Ground 3, a miscarriage of justice has resulted in relation to counts 1-7 [sic] and 12.""

31The written submissions were developed with respect to counts 1-7. However, their focus was upon counts 1 and 2 which, it was asserted, involved material most of which was downloaded on Wednesday, 22 March 2006 at about 3.30pm, and appeared to have been manipulated on 26 March 2006 between 9.23 and 9.24 am, as certain directories had been modified at those times. 

32So far as the opportunity to download material in private on 22 March 2006 was concerned, the appellant was then staying with his sister at South Yarra in Melbourne, convalescing following surgery. However, the Director stated in his written submissions, a proposition not contradicted by the appellant, that there was no evidence as to his whereabouts during that day, his sister having been at work from 8.30am until the evening: Tcpt, 02/09/09, p 1040(18)-(30). Although a nanny was at the home, her function was to look after the children. She did not give evidence.

33In relation to the morning of 26 March, there was evidence from several witnesses for the appellant that he was still staying with his sister and, from some time before 9am until about midday, the appellant and two friends (and his sister for part of the time) were away from the house watching a cycling event. This evidence should, in the appellant's submission, have been sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether material which was accepted to have been on his computer was manipulated by him on this occasion, and, if not, whether it had been downloaded by him and not by someone else.

34The complaint was that the trial judge dealt with the matter dismissively, on the basis that the times recorded within a computer system are ""notoriously unreliable"": Tcpt, Summing-up, 07/09/09 at pp 24-25. That passage should however be put to one side, as it related to counts 8-11, not counts 1 and 2. 

35The appellant set out in written submissions the evidence of the appellant's sister in respect of the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. He did not, however, set out the appellant's counsel's address with respect to that matter. These matters (not limited to the specific occasion) were addressed by counsel, although no great emphasis was placed on the detail of the evidence in the submissions for the appellant. That fact suggested that the issue now sought to be raised was not one seen to be equivalent to a waterproof alibi during the hearing. The appellant conceded that there had been no request for a redirection in respect of that matter and that he therefore required leave to raise the issue, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.

36A consideration of the relevant evidence as to the timing of events, the extensive manipulation of data on the computer, the unlikelihood of some external party downloading the material onto the appellant's computer, the unlikelihood that the appellant was not aware of the data on the computer, together with evidence as to the difficulties in assigning a specific time to particular activities on the computer by reference to the records on the computer hard drive, supported the Director's case that the appellant was well aware of the existence and nature of the material on his computer. That case might well have been regarded by the jury as overwhelming. Of the witnesses who were called, none gave evidence that he or she had any idea what material was on the computer and there was no suggestion that any of them, although sharing accommodation from time to time with the appellant, themselves manipulated the material. 

37Grounds 3 and 4 are therefore inconsistent with the manner in which the trial was run. They were first raised as grounds of appeal on 28 March 2011, some 18 months after the trial. The absence of a general direction of the kind referred to in ground 3 could not have caused a miscarriage of justice in the circumstances of the case. Leave under r 4 to raise these grounds should be refused.

(b) ground 5 - splitting defence address
38Ground 5 stated:

""His Honour erred in refusing to permit the appellant's closing address to be divided between senior and junior counsel, in circumstances where junior counsel with specialist computer knowledge had been wholly responsible for the cross-examination of the Crown's computer expert, and the computer evidence had constituted a complex and self-contained portion of the prosecution's case.

39That the counsel in question, Mr Lange, was present for the evidence of the principal prosecution computer expert, Mr Daniel, is not in doubt. His attendance part of the way through the trial for that purpose was explained to the jury at the time. However, the suggestion that the trial judge ""refused"" to permit him to address on matters involving specialist computer knowledge was fallacious, the fallacy being the implicit suggestion that there was an application made to the trial judge to that end.

40Shortly before the conclusion of the prosecution address, and in the absence of the jury, Mr Bellanto, senior counsel for the appellant, raised the issue in the following way (Tcpt, 04/09/09, p 11):

""BELLANTO: Your Honour, could I just mention one matter, in the interests of trying to speed things along I raised with Mr Game [senior counsel for the Director] the possibility of splitting our address in that Mr Lange touches on the matters that he brings-

HIS HONOUR: I've got no problems with that. Do you have any problem with that?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, I do, your Honour, I object to it. He can't have two addresses.

HIS HONOUR: I know he can't. It can only be done by consent.

BELLANTO: That's right, your Honour, I thought I'd offer it.

HIS HONOUR: All right, let's have the jury.""

41The ""offer"" fell well short of an application. Nor was there any suggestion that the unwillingness of the Director to consent gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. The written submissions for the appellant conceded that splitting a final address was a course to be reserved for ""exceptional cases"", referring to the principles helpfully enunciated by Kaye J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Hills (No 8) [2010] VSC 596 at [6]-[10]. He then submitted that the present was such an exceptional case, because of the specialised knowledge needed to deal with the computer evidence, being a discrete topic capable of severance, to avoid duplication and confusion. There followed extensive written submissions referring to overseas authorities, extracts from the cross-examination of Mr Daniel and principles relating to miscarriage of justice. None of these matters advanced in any way a case which had not been presented in those terms to the trial judge. The ground was without substance. It required an assessment of the factual matters at issue in the trial which was not assayed before the trial judge. Leave to raise this ground should be refused.

(c) ground 6 - direction as to use of computer material
42Ground 6 stated:

""His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury adequately, or at all, on the limited use, which could properly be made by the jury of the material contained in Exhibits T, U and V.""

43Exhibits T and U involved downloads of internet histories taken from the hard drive of the appellant's computer. They indicated websites visited at particular times. Exhibit V was a collection of 36 examples taken from Exhibits T and U. The material in the histories was used by Mr Daniel to demonstrate how access could be obtained to the contents of the hard drive. His description of the tasks he was undertaking was set out in the written submissions, but need not be repeated. The point made in summary was as follows (par 10):

""Thus, the Crown contended that Exhibits T, U and V, when coupled with the actual images, which were the subject of the earlier counts, as well as the similarity of names, permitted the jury to infer that the appellant had used a carriage service to access child pornography, contrary to s 474.19 Criminal Code (C'th). Accepting, for the purpose of the present argument, the validity of this explanation, then the jury was nonetheless left in a vacuum with regard to knowing how such evidence could be used during its deliberations.""

44The submissions accepted that the manner in which Mr Daniel was examined on the topic would have indicated to the jury that the evidence was only relevant to count 12, as demonstrating use of a telecommunication carriage service to access child pornography. Although the exhibits did not contain the relevant photographs, Mr Daniel gave evidence that his firm had been able to access approximately 100,000 images on the hard disc of which he estimated, without objection, that approximately three-quarters were of a pornographic nature: Tcpt, 24/08/09, pp 445(40) - 446(5).

45The crux of the complaint was that the material could only be relevant with respect to counts other than count 12 as tendency evidence, admissible pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). However, no tendency notice, issued for the purposes of that provision, was relied upon. Without a clear direction as to how to use the material, it was submitted that the potential for prejudice was plain because the material demonstrated that the appellant had ""frequently surfed the Internet for child pornography; thus, it is more likely that he was the sort of person who would now possess the kind of material, which was the subject of counts 1-7, or, indeed, engage in the type of activity charged in counts 8-11"": at par 13. To avoid such prejudice, it was necessary that the jury be directed that ""they must consider each count separately and ... consider it only by reference to the evidence that applies to it"": KRM v The Queen [2001] HCA 11; 206 CLR 221 at [36] (McHugh J).

46Specific complaint was made in respect of two directions. First, at p 21 of the summing-up, the trial judge stated:

""The Crown says the very volume of material, albeit that it concedes that there is significant duplication of parts of the material, depending upon where it might be within each of the various devices, the very volume of material points again to something other than accident or somebody other than John Cargnello, the accused, manipulating or inserting or bringing down this material into this system.""

47The trial judge had previously stated (Summing-up, p 16):

""You must not substitute the evidence of other conduct for evidence of the specific offences in the indictment. You must not reason that because the accused may have done something wrong on other occasions he must have done so on the occasions in the indictment.""

48The submissions concluded with an acknowledgment that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applied because no further direction was sought at trial. Reference was also made ""to the plain inadmissibility of Exhibits T, U and V in relation to"" counts other than count 12.

49The Director made two broad responses. The first was that no objection was taken to the tender of the material; no direction was sought as to the use of the material and no additional directions were sought at the conclusion of the summing-up. All of these propositions are correct and invoke the need for leave. However, the second basis of the Director's response was that while the exhibits were used in proof of count 12, they also formed part of a ""circumstantial case"" that no one other than the appellant was responsible for downloading and manipulating the child pornography on the computer hard drive. 

50In an appropriate case, there may be a need to distinguish aspects of circumstantial evidence which are indeed a form of tendency evidence. However, that problem was not explored in submissions in this case. It is by no means clear what precise direction could have been given which would have assisted the jury in respect of this material, once it was admitted. Exhibit U, which contained in some 350 pages a dump of a computer log, was not of itself highly prejudicial. It demonstrated a high volume of usage to a large number of sites, the names of which vary from the anodyne to the salacious. Exhibit T is in similar form, although the printout extends to some 560 pages. The suggestion that some further direction should have been given, in terms which are not made explicit, cannot be used as a belated attempt to remedy what is now seen as a forensic error in failing to object to the admissibility of the evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act.

51In the circumstances, no miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. Leave to raise this ground should be refused.

Counts 8-11: sentencing appeal
52The trial judge, quite correctly, treated these four counts as involving more serious conduct than the importation counts. The maximum sentence for the offence was imprisonment for 17 years. The same sentence, imprisonment for five years, was imposed in respect of all counts. It might be assumed that, if a non-parole period had been fixed in respect of this period alone, it would have been approximately three years (using the proportion of about 61% applied by the trial judge to the overall sentence).

53The submissions noted that the appellant was 55 years of age, had no prior criminal history and was serving his first custodial sentence. The sentencing judge addressed these considerations, but considered that they should be given less weight than in some other cases, referring to R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 at [65], although his Honour may have meant to refer to [64] where Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing) stated:

""There is a foundation for the approach that less weight should be attached to evidence of prior good character on sentence for offences of importing child pornography. It appears that such offences are committed frequently by persons of otherwise good character. General deterrence has been referred to as the 'paramount consideration' on sentence for this class of offence .... The fact that the offence is, in a sense, committed in secret is also relevant to this issue.""

54With respect to counts 8-11, the sentencing judge treated the conduct as more serious than mere possession of pornographic material, because it demonstrated ""not merely a detached fixation with the topic but encouragement to actually do what the images depicted and more"": Judgment, p 14. He further described the text messages as ""on their face persuasive and included implicitly claims of prior experience on the part of the offender"". He noted that, as with the other offences, there were steps taken to disguise the nature of the offending. The submissions challenged the finding of the trial judge that the criminality fell within the middle of the range for offences of that kind: Judgment, p 20. 

55With respect to the subjective circumstances of the offender, the sentencing judge stated (p 15):

""The offender has shown no contrition for these offences. ... He has shown no relevant co-operation with the authorities. He was entitled to put himself on the State but at the same time he cannot avail himself of any assistance where none was rendered ....""

56Two further factors which were considered by the sentencing judge and reiterated on appeal require specific consideration. These involved supposed ""extra-curial punishment"" and the delay in the matter coming to trial.

(a) extra-curial punishment
57The factors relied upon as extra-curial punishment related to the business which the appellant was engaged in prior to his arrest and imprisonment. His sister's partner gave evidence on the sentencing hearing, which the sentencing judge appears to have accepted, that in the year ending June 2009, the business showed a pre-tax profit of $850,000 (in Canadian currency). The business was then said to be valued at $7 million. However, the removal of the appellant from active participation in the business, which involved some form of gaming security services, appears to have led to a collapse of the value so that, at the date of the sentencing hearing, they were thought to be worth little more than their liabilities, which were $1 million. (His Honour did not find it necessary to determine whether these figures were in Canadian or Australian dollars for the purposes of the exercise.) 

58His Honour dealt with the submission that the appellant had suffered a very substantial extra-curial punishment in the following way (p 17):

""Whilst I conclude that probably a significant part of the dramatic diminution in value of his company has been because he can no longer manage it, the question is whether this represents extra curial punishment or is simply a consequence of his conviction. It seems to me that the effective demise of this man's business is a consequence of his conviction for these crimes rather than a form of punishment for it.""

59After referring to a number of authorities dealing with the issue, he concluded that it would be ""wrong to categorise this offender's loss as a consequence of his crimes as extra curial punishment, but it is a factor that can be taken into account in a generalised sense"": Judgment, p 18. The overall effect of this reasoning is not entirely clear, but it appears to accept that the loss of the appellant's business is a material detriment that can be taken into account, though not one to be accorded significant weight.

60It is beyond doubt that the various steps in the criminal process, from arrest to trial, to conviction and loss of liberty can have multifarious effects, not only for the offender, but also for his or her family and associates. As the trial judge noted, it is difficult to know whether incarceration, which results in the loss of liberty to the breadwinner of a family, thereby removing the source of mortgage repayments with the consequent loss of the family home, is to be treated differently from the loss of managerial skills to a small business or the loss of rental accommodation to the family of an offender with no assets or savings. Some of these considerations were addressed in Einfeld v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 at [85]-[100]. First, it is clear that no particular diminution in sentence should be accorded for consequences of imprisonment which will, in a general sense, be common to all offenders subject to custodial sentences. Secondly, it is not generally appropriate that those who are wealthier, or who have a higher public profile, should receive lesser sentences because they have more to lose as a result of conviction. Thirdly, it is necessary to distinguish between consequences for the offender and consequences for his or her family and associates.

61As the sentencing judge properly recognised, the matters to be taken into account in the present exercise were identified in s 16A of the Crimes Act. They included ""the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person"": s 16A(2)(m), as in force at the time of sentencing. However, to identify material factors is not necessarily to explain how they will be taken into account in particular circumstances.

62It is no doubt true to say that the value of a business may be calculated as a multiple of its annual pre-tax profits; on the other hand, a purchaser would take account of the possibility (or probability) that the profitability in the past has been a factor of the involvement of a principal executive. A purchaser would not be likely to pay a sum calculated purely by reference to past profitability if the executive in question were not continuing in that role. Accordingly, the disastrous drop in value may be overstated in the submissions. Further, the turnaround in the fortunes of the business appears to have pre-dated the appellant's conviction. That may have been partly due to his pre-occupation with his forthcoming trial. However, the same consequence could have flowed from injury or illness. Taking all these considerations into account, it is not apparent that the sentencing judge applied any wrong principle in the approach set out above.

(b) delay
63The sentencing judge dealt with two aspects of the lapse of time involved in the present case: Judgment, p 20. First, he noted that the counts 8-11 offences had occurred over nine years before the trial. That factor was not considered significant in the absence of any difference in sentencing patterns, which would need to be taken into account if they had occurred. He indicated that none had been drawn to his attention.

64Secondly, the sentencing judge gave consideration to the delay between the appellant's arrest and his trial, a period of some three years. Although the circumstances were reagitated on appeal, the manner in which error was asserted was not identified with precision. The sentencing judge stated at pp 20-21:

""I find that about half of the delay was caused by those problems confronting the Crown. I take this delay into account in [the] offender's favour when sentencing. He has had the uncertainty of the process over him with its obvious distractions and detriments.""

65On the appellant's argument, the trial was originally intended to proceed on 26 November 2007, almost 15 months after his arrest. No complaint appears to be made in respect of that period of delay. However, by giving consideration in the appellant's favour to half of the three year period (approximately 18 months) account has been taken of all but three months of the subsequent delay. There was no error of principle, nor unreasonableness or other error demonstrated in the approach taken by the sentencing judge in this respect.

(c) manifestly excessive sentence
(i) general principles
66One consideration which might be taken into account is that, although an offence under s 50DB does not require that the conduct encouraged in fact occurs, at least in some circumstances it is likely that the offending will be at a higher level of culpability where it can be shown that the conduct did occur. In such a case, the legislature has indicated that the person guilty of encouraging will be liable to the same maximum imprisonment (17 years) as the person who engaged in sexual intercourse. 

67It might be doubted, however, whether the encourager or facilitator should be liable to a greater penalty in circumstances where the encouragement was at a person-to-person level (with no large target audience involved) and no specific victim in mind. That consideration arises because most of the cases appear to involve what might be described as the substantive offences under ss 50BA-50BC, rather than incitement or encouragement. 

68The comparison between the cases involving offenders engaged in sexual activity and those encouraging or facilitating others to engage in such activity must, of course, be approached with caution. The culpability of a facilitator who arranges for groups of people to exploit, for example, child prostitutes in South East Asia may be seen as higher than that of the individual who spends a week in a tourist destination and indulges in such activity. On the other hand, the culpability of an individual who passes on information about the availability of children for prostitution in particular places, without any further step to facilitate actual sexual activity, will generally be less culpable than the person who engages in the sexual activity, if it occurs.

69A comparison is also available with respect to sentences imposed for sexual activity with young persons carried out within Australia and punished in accordance with local laws. This point of reference was adopted by this Court in R v Wicks [2005] NSWCCA 409 by McClellan CJ at CL (Adams and Hoeben JJ agreeing). The offender in that case had been sentenced, on a plea of guilty, with respect to six offences committed during a 10 day holiday in Thailand in February 2003. Four counts involved sexual intercourse with persons under 16 years of age contrary to s 50BA(1) of the Crimes Act, together with one offence of inducing a person under 16 years of age to have sexual intercourse with another person. For each offence the trial judge imposed a sentence of five years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three years. For a lesser offence under s 50BD (inducing a person under the age of 16 years to commit an act of indecency) a sentence of three years imprisonment was imposed.

70McClellan CJ at CL noted that in various Australian States the sentencing regime discriminated according to the age of the child and according to whether circumstances of aggravation (such as being a carer or a person in authority with respect to the child) are involved. He referred to the decision of this Court in R v Percival [2001] NSWCCA 429, involving an offender convicted of two counts of sexual intercourse with victims, each aged between 12 and 14 years. The acts involved fellatio and the victims each worked for the offender. Two further assaults were taken into account. A sentence of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years, as imposed by the sentencing judge, was upheld on appeal. The maximum penalty in respect of the offences was then eight years imprisonment.

71McClellan CJ at CL also referred to R v Pearson [2005] NSWCCA 116, a case involving a plea of guilty to three counts of aggravated indecent assault and one count of using a child under the age of 14 for pornographic purposes. The offences carried a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The offender was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. In Wicks, the Court described the sentences of five years as being at ""the lowest end of the available range"", but did not intervene on that basis. Rather, it was held that the sentencing judge had erred in failing to partly accumulate the sentences, all being imposed concurrently. The appropriate degree of accumulation was held to be a period of two years. The effective sentence was therefore a period of imprisonment of seven years, with a non-parole period of five years.

72It therefore appears that the only case of direct assistance in the present circumstances is Kaye v The Queen [2004] WASCA 227. That was relied upon by the sentencing judge, but primarily for the purpose of noting the importance of general deterrence in dealing with such offences, noted by McLure J. Kaye was also discussed by McClellan CJ at CL in Wicks. As correctly noted in Wicks, Kaye involved one count of offering to assist a person to engage in an act of indecency in Thailand. The conduct in question occurred in October and November 2000 and was thus committed in the same year as that of the appellant in respect of counts 8-11. The applicant operated, apparently on a somewhat informal basis, as a travel agent assisting persons seeking to travel to Thailand. A customer responding to an advertisement in a local Perth newspaper attended the applicant's unit in Perth and noted pictures of young looking Thai boys on the walls. The applicant explained that these and other boys were available as sexual partners and that he could arrange a meeting for a customer. He continued to press the possible services of the boys in conversation with the customer after the customer had expressed a lack of interest in males under the age of 18. The trip to Thailand did not eventuate because the police raided the applicant's premises and later arrested him. The applicant was convicted after a trial and sentenced to imprisonment for six years, with a non-parole period of three years. His appeal against sentence was rejected.

73Particular factors bore a degree of similarity with the present case. First, the offender claimed that he himself had engaged in sexual activity with young persons. Secondly, he was 71 years of age, with no prior criminal record. Thirdly, he had a record of community service. On the other hand, there were factors which tended to make the offending more serious than the present case. First, it formed part of what appeared to be an established business venture; secondly, it involved a proposed degree of facilitation which would have resulted in direct contact with identified individuals; thirdly, the offender was prepared to press the services of young boys on an apparently uninterested customer.

74Factors which may have diminished the severity of the sentence in Kaye, which were not available in the present case, included the greater age of the applicant and the fact that the prison sentence would weigh heavily upon him because of ill health and a psychiatric condition. However, those factors were not considered by the sentencing judge to have had ""a significantly greater effect upon him than upon someone in good health and without such condition"": at [40] (in the judgment of Malcolm CJ).

75In considering whether the sentence was manifestly excessive, Malcolm CJ noted that it appeared to be only the second case of its kind: at [42]. The first, R v Ruppert was an unreported decision of the County Court of Victoria delivered on 19 August 1998. The case was of limited assistance because it involved writing letters to women in Ghana suggesting they should train young female children to engage in sexual acts. The sentencing judge had been satisfied that ""the prisoner's central purpose was one of sexual self-gratification by writing them, and this is not the crime for which he is to be sentenced"" (quoted in Kaye at [44]). 

76The Court in Kaye also considered, by way of comparison, its earlier decision in R v Lee [2000] WASCA 73; 112 A Crim R 168 which had involved one count of sexual intercourse outside Australia, eight counts of acts of indecency and 15 counts relating to child pornography. The sentence imposed by the trial judge on the count of sexual intercourse, of eight years imprisonment, was reduced as excessive in all the circumstances. The total effective sentence imposed, after reduction, was 11 years, with a minimum term of 4.5 years. In rejecting the appeal against sentence in Kaye, Malcolm CJ stated at [54]:

""While the offence fell at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness contemplated by the legislation, I consider that a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years fell well within the discretion of the sentencing Judge. Ruppert differs significantly from the present case in that in Ruppert the offender pleaded guilty, and, as the learned sentencing Judge said in that case, 'The likelihood of the perversion being effected was low'. In the present case, although the applicant did not profit from the offence, his status as the operator of a travel business providing accommodation and contacts in Thailand to persons interested meant that the likelihood of acts of indecency against children under 16 being committed as a result of his efforts was increased. That, taken in conjunction with the applicant's lack of remorse, indicates that this offence was more serious than that in Ruppert.

Murray J and McClure J agreed, McLure J adding the remarks as to the significance of general deterrence, noted by the sentencing judge in the present case: at [66]. She also explained further why age and health were not significant considerations: at [65].

77It is necessary to refer to the recent case of R v Van Der Zyden [2012] QCA 89 and the authorities discussed by Muir JA (with the concurrence of the Chief Justice and Margaret Wilson AJA) at [111]-[117]. That matter involved an unsuccessful appeal by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions against the leniency of the sentences imposed at trial. The offences, which took place over a period of almost two years, in Kiribati, involved 15 counts and four complainants. Sentences with respect to acts of indecency involved imprisonment for 12 months whilst the more serious offences of sexual intercourse involved imprisonment for three years six months with a minimum term of 21 months. All sentences were to be served concurrently. The rejection of the appeal suggests a sentencing range which would be considered low for such offending in Australia, as discussed in Wicks and Kaye. Little weight appears to have been given to the maximum penalty available.

78There are aspects of the judgment in Van Der Zyden which suggest it may have limited weight for present purposes. In particular, the judgment of primary significance in the present case, Kaye, appears to have been misunderstood. After noting that the offender had been sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years, the judgment in Van Der Zyden continued at [116]:

""His offending conduct involved numerous sexual encounters with boys aged between 15 and 16. The offender travelled abroad for the purposes of engaging in paedophilia and to entice his victims he placed advertisements in a newspaper. The nature and degree of the offending was far worse than in the present case.""

In fact, Kaye involved one offence under s 50DB and a far heavier sentence for an attempted facilitation. The description in Van Der Zyden suggests the precedent of Kaye was inappropriately discounted.

(ii) application of principles
79Because the events in Kaye occurred in the same year as the events the subject of counts 8-11, and because it appears to be the only case involving an offence under s 50DB for which the sentence is known, it is appropriate to have regard to it in considering whether the sentence imposed on the appellant was excessive. Nevertheless, it does not constitute a ""range"" and allowance must be made for that fact.

80Although there was no degree of accumulation of the sentences, the fact that identical separate sentences were imposed for each of the offences, including one which was not said to involve encouragement of an offence of sexual intercourse, but only acts of indecency, invites attention to the contents of the emails. 

81Count 10 related to one email sent by the appellant to a recipient only known as ""auto"" with a number, but apparently in reply to an email which is not referred to in the evidence. The email referred to sex with girls under 16 in Costa Rica stating that, despite recent laws against such activities, ""you can still find 20- [15 year olds] in the streets but you need to be careful"". The message also stated that, as in Bangkok parks, ""fun can still be had with 18- to 20- [13-15 year olds] found in shopping centers. You smile, see if it's returned and then negotiate from there"".

82This exchange demonstrates a degree of knowledge and experience, but is at a level of generality and in the form of reportage rather than active encouragement, which could not warrant a lengthy term of imprisonment. It is clear that the recipient is a person having similar sexual interests, apparently with some degree of experience. Such an exchange could not warrant a significant sentence of imprisonment and, taken in isolation, might not warrant imprisonment at all.

83Counts 8, 9 and 11 all relate to parts of an on-going exchange of emails between the appellant (using the pseudonym ""John Cutter"") and ""zippyboy"". They were sent on 1, 5 and 8 March 2000 and are part of a chain in the course of which the appellant and the recipient were planning to meet in Bangkok in late March 2000. Count 8, an email dated 1 March 2000, referred to information which the appellant was hoping to receive, indicating that ""younger girls can also be found around the parks in BKK [Bangkok]"". The email identified a specific establishment by name which was said to have over 100 girls in the ""fishbowl"" with ""an alternate fishbowl for underage girls"". The appellant stated that ""[y]ou have to get there early to get the lookers"" and that the place was popular with Thai men attending after work.

84Count 9 involved an email sent by the appellant on 5 March to the same person. It commenced with reference to a subscription list. It then purported to pass on information from other emails which the appellant had received about picking up ""younger girls"" in parks in Bangkok. They are referred to as ""primarily schoolgirls from poorer families that want to supplement their allowance"". Prices were given in respect of a 14-17 year age group. The email then refers to information with regard to Phnom Pen involving girls between 11 and 12 years old, which appears to have been the appellant's preferred age group for sexual intercourse. The appellant was expressing a hope to meet the recipient in Canada prior to visiting South East Asia.

85The email of 5 March contained little by way of specific information in relation to locations, but a clear intention to seek very young girls for sexual intercourse. The recipient might be characterised as a prospective companion with similar interests.

86Count 11 involved an email of 8 March 2000 that provided the recipient with travel details and a ""plan"" for proposed sex tourism activities. There is some indication that the appellant was the primary source of experience and information and that the recipient was looking for guidance and assistance. That is consistent with the email which appears to have started the chain, being one from ""zippyboy"" dated 26 January 2000 indicating that he was arriving in Phnom Penh around March 28 and asking for ""[a]nyone interested in hooking up there?"" Further, in an email of 28 January, the appellant explained to him the use of ""minus 5"", stating that ""[b]ecause emails can be read by outsiders we never mention ages under 18 and use a minus sign to indicate every five years to add to the age"". In a message of 29 January, the recipient stated that this was his first trip to South East Asia, ""in Cambodia I'm gonna go with the flow - I hear that 15, 16 is quite common there -"". In response to a question from the recipient as to his experience in Cambodia, the appellant stated ""[n]ot recently but I have been to both Laos & Cambodia some years ago"".

87It remains to consider whether the sentences imposed in respect of the 'encouragement' counts 8, 9 and 11 were manifestly excessive. The appellant's contention in this regard is based in part on the sentences themselves, and in part on the observation that his culpability was ""at the very least at the middle of the range for offences of this type"": Judgment, p 20.

88This kind of characterisation, which was no doubt encouraged by the introduction into State law of s 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) with respect to offences the subject of standard non-parole periods, is often unhelpful. That is because it is rarely explained what is meant by the 'middle of the range'. Clearly a range is not a point on a scale, but it could cover anything from 25% to 75% of a most serious case, or it could be far more narrowly defined. Unless it is narrowly defined, it is unlikely to provide useful guidance for the sentencing judge, let alone for those reading the judgment.

89Assuming that it is more narrowly defined, the following factors might be thought to diminish the seriousness of the offence:

(a) the offences involved an exchange of a small number of emails between like minded persons;
(b) the information was mainly at a level of generality about places where young people available for sexual activities might be located;
(c) there was no attempt to identify or place the recipient of the information in contact with any individual, whether organiser or victim;
(d) the email exchanges occurred over a period of some 10 days;
(e) because the appellant was not concerned to identify individuals, it could not be said that he was exploiting an existing relationship or position of authority;
(f) except at a high level of generality, it was not probable that his conduct placed any group of potential victims at greater risk than they would otherwise have been; certainly there was no specific inference that any individual had been harmed as a result of his conduct.

90The sentencing judge accepted that the offences were not committed for profit, although had they been, they would probably have been laid under s 50DA. He also took into account, correctly, that generally deterrence was a significant element in the sentencing exercise and that personal deterrence was a significant element in circumstances where there was no evidence of contrition or insight into the harm that could be done to children by the kind of conduct which the appellant was willing to promote. The real difficulty in the present case is to identify an appropriate sentencing range, taking account of the objective seriousness of the events and the subjective circumstances of the offender.

91The contextual material demonstrated a relationship between two men with similar interests developing, with the appellant being the source of information and experience. The purpose was to meet in Bangkok with the intention of finding girls as young as 10 or 11 years of age willing to engage in sexual intercourse as well as fellatio. The probability that the recipient of the emails would engage in such activities would appear to have been quite high, but the fact of such activities was not proved. The degree of encouragement was significant. In these circumstances, an overall sentence for the overall course of conduct involving five years imprisonment was within the appropriate range. The non-parole period, if apportioned as between counts 8-11 and the sentences on which those sentences were accumulated, being approximately three years, was also well within the appropriate range for a mandatory custodial term. It is necessary, however, to consider whether such sentences should have been imposed for each offence.

(iii) error in sentence structure
92When sentencing for federal offences, it is necessary to impose separate sentences for each offence: Crimes Act, s 19. On the other hand, having determined that it is appropriate to fix a non-parole period, the sentencing court must fix a single non-parole period in respect of the totality of the sentences: s 19AB(1). It follows that the same approach must be applied to the fixing of the individual sentences, by reference to each count, as explained in relation to State sentencing in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [40] (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ). The application of that principle in respect of federal sentencing was confirmed in Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 at [27]ff (Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ, Gleeson CJ and Kirby J agreeing). It follows, as this Court has now explained in a number of cases, that where a sentencing judge imposes the same sentence, reflecting the overall criminality of a course of conduct, in respect of individual elements of that conduct, there will have been error because the offender will have been sentenced more than once for common elements. The fact that each of counts 8, 9 and 11 were the subject of wholly concurrent identical sentences demonstrates that that happened in the present case.

93In R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66, Simpson J stated (with the concurrence of Mason P):

""[9] Pre-Pearce, it was possible to discern two different approaches to sentencing for multiple offences. The first was to select a single charge (a lead or representative count) and, in accordance with the principle of totality, on that charge impose a sentence that properly reflected the overall criminality involved in all offences. On the remaining counts, comparatively lenient sentences, frequently fixed terms, were imposed. The second approach was, again with the principle of totality in mind, to select a sentence appropriate to the overall criminality and impose that sentence in respect of all or most of the charges. Both of these approaches avoided the need for elaborate exercises in accumulation of sentences.

[10] Neither of these approaches would survive the application of the Pearce principles. In the case of a judge adopting the first approach, the lengthy sentence imposed in relation to the lead or representative count would appear excessive and those imposed on the remaining counts would appear inadequate. None would represent 'an appropriate sentence' for the specific offence for which it was imposed. On the second approach, all sentences would appear excessive for the specific charges to which they related, even when the ultimate term to be served was unimpeachable.""

94The need to adopt an offence-specific approach where multiple offences have been charged in respect of overlapping elements of criminality has been confirmed in numerous cases thereafter: see, for example, R v Knight [2005] NSWCCA 253; 155 A Crim R 252 at [78] (Johnson J, Mason P and Barr J agreeing); R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255; 174 A Crim R 100 at [37] (Howie J, Giles JA and Fullerton J agreeing) and Porter v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 145 at [72]-[74] (Johnson J, Bell JA and McCallum J agreeing). The approach adopted in the present case was therefore erroneous.

(iv) resentencing
95An appropriate way of solving the problem in the present case is to impose separate sentences in respect of each of counts 8, 9 and 11, recognising that they were discrete steps in a period of conduct warranting a degree of accumulation in order to reflect the totality of the appellant's culpability. There being no particular reason to distinguish between the three emails on March 1, 5 and 8, it is appropriate to impose the same sentence in respect of each. Because each must be viewed in the context of the chain of emails commencing in January 2000, and because each is properly to be understood in the context of the other emails the subject of the other counts, each involves a significant level of criminality, but with significant overlapping elements. 

96The email the subject of count 10 did not warrant the sentence imposed: see [82]-[83] above. The sentence in respect of count 10 should be set aside and a period of imprisonment of three months should be imposed, to run concurrently with the other sentences. 

97While the exercise is to an extent arbitrary, I would propose sentences of three years imprisonment in respect of each of counts 8, 9 and 11, the second and third sentences each being accumulated on 12 months of the previous sentence. The sentence on count 10 should be served wholly concurrently with the sentence on count 11. The sentencing judge accumulated the sentences for counts 8-11 on 18 months of the sentences imposed for the other counts. That course is not challenged and should be maintained. The four sentences thus imposed each commenced on 8 March 2011. I propose that the sentence on count 8 commence on that date, the sentence on count 9 commence on 8 March 2012 and the sentences on counts 10 and 11 commence on 8 March 2013. The sentence on count 10 will terminate before the expiration of the non-parole period, which will remain the date on which the appellant will first be eligible for conditional release.

98Accordingly, I propose the following orders:

(1) Dismiss the appeal against conviction in respect of counts 8-11.

(2) Refuse leave to appeal against conviction on counts 1-7 and 12.

(3) Grant leave to appeal against the sentences imposed in respect of counts 8-11.

(4) Allow the appeal in respect of the sentences on counts 8-11; quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and re-sentence the appellant to the following terms:

(a) with respect to count 8, a term of imprisonment for three years commencing on 8 March 2011 and terminating on 7 March 2014;
(b) in respect of count 9, a term of three years imprisonment commencing on 8 March 2012 and terminating on 7 March 2015;
(c) with respect to count 10, a term of imprisonment of three months commencing on 8 March 2013 and terminating on 7 June 2013;
(d) on count 11, a term of imprisonment of three years commencing on 8 March 2013 and terminating on 7 March 2016.

(5) In respect of the sentences imposed in the District Court on counts 1-7 and 12, and the further sentences imposed by these orders on counts 8-11, confirm the non-parole period imposed in the District Court, being four years commencing on 8 September 2009 and expiring on 7 September 2013.

(6) The earliest date on which the appellant is eligible for conditional release is therefore 7 September 2013.

99PRICE J: I agree with Basten JA.

100S G CAMPBELL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA and with his Honour's reasons.

2759776,R v C Shedden [2012] NSWSC 854,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HER HONOUR:  On 31 May 2012 the offender was convicted by a jury of the murder of Joshua Maynard at Raymond Terrace. 
2A standard non-parole period of 20 years applies to murder as provided in Div 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
3The deceased died as a result of a single shotgun wound to his chest after he emerged from the front seat of a car that was driven by one of his friends into a suburban street in Raymond Terrace at around midnight on 29 June 2010.  The shooting was the culmination of a series of violent encounters during the course of the night between two groups of boys and young men, the offender leading one group with the active assistance of his brother, and the deceased leading the other group which included his younger brother, Thomas.
4The offender's brother, John Shedden, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of his participation in a joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased (and those in his company) where the intended victims of those assaults were exposed to an appreciable risk of suffering serious injury (R v Shedden [2012] NSWSC 759).  He did not give evidence at the offender's trial.  Daniel Forbes, another member of the offender's group, also pleaded guilty to manslaughter on a similar basis.  He gave evidence for the Crown pursuant to an undertaking which attracted a discount on sentence (R v Forbes [2011] NSWSC 1547).  Others associated with the offender also gave evidence for the Crown: Bradley White gave evidence with the benefit of an immunity from prosecution from the Attorney-General and AB under a certificate issued pursuant to s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995.  The deceased's brother was also called by the Crown as were three other young men in the deceased's group: Dean Rivers, Dillon Bell and Daniel Wright.  None were indemnified.  None applied to give evidence under a s 128 certificate. 
5In his evidence at trial the offender admitted to discharging the shotgun but claimed that he acted in defence of himself (or his brother).  At the time of arraignment the offender entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the basis that his response to the threat from the deceased (as he perceived it) was excessive.  The Crown did not accept the plea of guilty in discharge of the indictment.  By its verdict the jury must be taken to have rejected any reasonable possibility that the offender acted in self-defence. 
6The Crown relied upon the evidence at trial for sentencing purposes supplemented only by the tender of the offender's criminal antecedents.  The offender tendered a report from Dr John Jacmon, psychologist.  I also received a victim impact statement from Ms Tracy Maynard, the deceased's mother.  I acknowledge her loss and the grief all members of the Maynard family have suffered by the death of a valued and loved family member and I extend my sympathy to them.  Consistent with legislative provisions which allowed me to receive her statement in the sentencing proceedings, it does not inform the sentence to be imposed in this case.
7The factual findings I am required to make for sentencing purposes, in particular those that inform the objective seriousness of the offender's criminal conduct, including but not limited to the question of intent, must be consistent with the jury's verdict.  Any findings of fact adverse to the offender, again including but not limited to the question of intent, must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  I acknowledge that it is sufficient that the matters upon which the offender relied in mitigation of sentence are to be proved by him on the balance of probabilities.  
8The Crown submitted that I would be satisfied that the deceased was not armed when he was shot by the offender, a finding relevant to an assessment of objective seriousness.  The jury's verdict does not necessarily involve a factual finding of that kind.  They may have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not act in self-defence even were the deceased armed although, given the issues that confronted the jury at trial, I consider this unlikely.  
9The Crown also submitted that I would be satisfied that the offender discharged the shotgun with the intention of killing the deceased which, in addition to other features of the offending, including statutory features of aggravation, should attract the imposition of the standard non-parole period, there being nothing in mitigation, or in the offender's subjective circumstances, which would warrant a lesser minimum period in custody (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120). 
10Ms Davenport SC sought to persuade me that having regard to the ballistics evidence, which established that the shotgun was discharged over a distance of between 6 and 8 metres, and that the single shot was fired in highly volatile circumstances with two groups of young men confronting one another with aggression in a poorly lit suburban street, I would not be satisfied that the offender discharged the gun with the intention of killing the deceased as distinct from intending to cause him really serious injury.  She also sought to persuade me that the offender was responding to provocative conduct on the part of the deceased when he discharged the gun because the deceased emerged from the car armed and aggressively wielding a sword or machete, threatening to use it to stab someone.  She submitted that despite the jury's rejection of the defence of self-defence, a finding on the probabilities that the deceased was armed when he got out of the car remained open for sentencing purposes in mitigation of sentence as provided for in s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
11It is necessary to refer to the evidence in some detail to resolve this issue.  This also involves my making an assessment of the reliability and the honesty of the witnesses to the shooting, where most were involved to a greater or lesser extent in the violence that preceded it, where all were allied with one group or the other; and where most were affected by alcohol or by a mixture of drugs and alcohol.  
12I have already noted that Daniel Forbes gave evidence for the Crown and was sentenced on the basis of that undertaking (R v Forbes [2011] NSWSC 1547) and that Bradley White gave evidence under an indemnity from the Attorney General.  Although both witnesses gave evidence implicating the offender, they also gave evidence that the deceased was armed.  I have grave doubts as to whether their evidence was the complete truth.  
The facts
13Some time between 6pm and 8pm on 29 June 2010 Daniel Forbes was walking with his friends, Chris Wilson, Blake Russell, AB and John Pollard on Mount Hall Road at Raymond Terrace when a red Commodore in which the deceased aged 20, his younger brother Thomas aged 19, Dillon Bell aged 19, Daniel Wright aged 19 and Dean Rivers aged 20 were travelling as passengers, stopped and the deceased alighted.  The car was being driven by Bell.  The red Commodore was owned by the deceased.  Bell had been designated by the deceased as the driver and was not drinking.  The others in the red Commodore had consumed considerable quantities of alcohol over the course of the day.  Forbes and his two friends were aged 18.  They had been celebrating Russell's 18th birthday and were also well affected by alcohol.  
14The precise circumstances which precipitated the confrontation between these two groups of young men was the subject of some conflict at the trial.  The evidence establishes to my satisfaction that Wilson was punched by the deceased in a largely unprovoked attack causing facial injuries from which he bled profusely.  Forbes was also assaulted. 
15Forbes and his friends ran from the scene the short distance to his home in Clyde Circuit where he telephoned the offender's brother.  John Shedden had formed a friendship with Forbes over the time that they had resided as next-door neighbours a year or so earlier.  On learning of the assault John Shedden invited Forbes and his friends to come to his home at Links Drive, a neighbouring street.  Forbes arrived with Russell, AB and Wilson.  Shannon Purkiss, JB and Luke Nable arrived later having been summoned to the house by Forbes.  
16The evidence compels a finding that thereafter John Shedden permitted his home to be used as a base from which an armed retaliatory attack could be planned and launched against the deceased and those in his group who might still be in the area (or in the event that they returned to the area), and that he arranged for the offender and White to attend for that purpose.  En route to his brother's house the offender armed himself with a loaded shortened shotgun.  Thereafter he assumed the lead role in the events of the night.
17Forbes gave evidence that he saw the offender pull a gun from the right sleeve of his jacket soon after he arrived (and that he opened the breach and unloaded and reloaded a cartridge) and that before the group left the house the offender concealed the gun in the sleeve of his jacket.  The offender did not put that evidence in contest.  He gave evidence that he brought the gun and ammunition with him because his brother told him there were cars circling the block and that he believed his brother when he said the people in the cars would have guns.  In the absence of any evidence that cars were ""circling the block"" at any time that evening, and where the only information available to John Shedden was that the young men and boys had a fist fight, I reject the offender's explanation for arriving at his brother's house armed.  I am compelled to the conclusion that the offender collected the gun either intending to use it or being prepared to use it in launching the retaliatory attack. 
18Forbes gave evidence that they left John Shedden's house in a group to see if they could find the boys who had assaulted them earlier that night.  He claimed there was no conversation in the house as to what would happen if they found them.  Some of the other young men and boys associated with the offender's group gave similar evidence.  I regard their evidence generally as self-serving and unconvincing.  In particular, I am unable to accept AB's evidence that the offender and his brother instructed the boys in his group when they left the house that they should not take any weapons with them, or that only the offender and his brother were armed when they left.
19I also reject the evidence of Forbes and his mother that he left his home in Clyde Circuit and went to John Shedden's house unarmed.  I accept AB's evidence that when Forbes left his mother's house he was armed with what he described as ""a knife or a sword"".  I am also satisfied that Nable was armed with a knife when he arrived at John Shedden's house and that he was given the knife by Forbes' mother.  
20The offender denied having participated in or leading an attack on the deceased and his friends, whether in retaliation for the assault suffered by Wilson and Forbes or for any other reason.  He said the only reason that he left his brother's house with the younger men and his brother was because his brother did not want them in his house any more and that the offender wanted to safely shepherd Forbes home.  I reject that evidence.  I am satisfied that the offender led the group from his brother's house on foot to launch a retaliatory attack and that White followed in a car with the same objective.  I am also satisfied that the opportunity presented itself near the intersection of Links Drive and Mount Hall Road when the red Commodore was pelted with hand thrown missiles of various kinds and struck by a metal bar wielded by John Shedden and then chased from the area by White.  White collided with the red Commodore at a roundabout after a car chase over 4 kilometres.  Neither the deceased nor the occupants of the red Commodore got out of the car during that attack.  There is no evidence that the offender participated in the attack or that he drew the loaded shotgun from his jacket sleeve.  This is irrelevant to an assessment of the criminality attending his use of the gun to kill the deceased some hours later.
21My having rejected the evidence of Forbes that he left his mother's house unarmed has a direct bearing on the weight that I am prepared to give to other aspects of his evidence, in particular his evidence as to what happened later that evening, including at the time of the shooting.  It also has a bearing on the question of who was armed with the large black handled machete found by a resident in Links Drive after the shooting and after both groups had dispersed.  That machete was tendered in evidence at the trial.  (I note that the machete was located on the same side of Links Drive where the knife Nable had been given by Forbes' mother was found.)    
22I repeat, it was the offender's case at trial and on sentence that the deceased was wielding the machete when he emerged from the car immediately prior to being shot and the Crown case was that he was unarmed.  The offender gave evidence that the deceased was armed, as did others in his group.  AB described the deceased as having a brown handled machete which he identified as the one tendered in evidence.  Purkiss said the deceased got out of the car holding a ""sword"" which he thought was the machete tendered in evidence.  White gave evidence in chief that the deceased was not armed with the machete but that John Shedden had it in his possession.  Under cross-examination White said that it was dark and he could not see very well and that it was ""possible"" that the deceased was holding the machete and that it ""could have been"" even bigger than the machete tendered in evidence.  Russell said that the deceased was holding a knife about two feet in length.  Forbes said the deceased had a sword, by which he meant a big knife, 30-40 cm in length with a curved edge.  JB said the deceased was holding a knife.  Russell, Forbes and JB were not asked by the Crown to identify the machete when giving their evidence.
23Ms Davenport sought to persuade me that the deceased, and those with him in the red Commodore, returned to the area where they had assaulted Forbes and Wilson earlier with the hope of a further confrontation, and to inflict further violence if necessary, and that for this reason they were not unwitting victims of the attack launched by the offender's group at the intersection of Links Drive and Mount Hall Road.  She also submitted that the deceased and his group returned a further time after he and his brother armed themselves for a retaliatory attack.  The evidence does not support that submission.
24Daniel Wright (an occupant of the red Commodore) gave what I accept as an honest account that after the fist fight on Mount Hall Road his friends were, as he described it, ""pumped up"", but that after driving into Newcastle and spending an hour or so at Nobby's Beach they had calmed down and, so far as he was concerned, their intentions in returning to Raymond Terrace were simply to drive around in the deceased's car and keep drinking.  The return journey to Newcastle and its timing relative to other events was supported by telephone records.  Wright said that things only ""flared up again"" when the red Commodore was attacked and damaged by the offender's group as they were travelling from Newcastle along Mount Hall Road towards a friend's house in Clyde Circuit (coincidentally where Forbes lived) and then the car was further damaged after the collision in the ensuing car chase.  
25After the collision the deceased and his group drove on to where the deceased was living in Heatherbrae.  Each of the young men in the deceased's group gave evidence that the deceased was furious at the damage done to the rear bumper bar and the gash in the driver's side door of his car and, as Dean Rivers described it, ""the other boys were also fairly worked up"".  At Heatherbrae the battery from the red Commodore was transferred into a blue Commodore (also owned by the deceased) and the group drove back into Raymond Terrace.  While they each said that this was principally to visit with their friend at Clyde Circuit, they also decided, at that time, that if they came across the boys that had attacked the car they would, as Rivers described it, ""square up"".  The question that arises is whether they armed themselves for that purpose.
26At trial each of the witnesses associated with the deceased was cross-examined consistent with the offender's case that the deceased armed himself at Heatherbrae with the machete before returning to Raymond Terrace in the blue Commodore and that he did so with the intention of finding the boys who had damaged his car and to inflict violence on them in retaliation and that he emerged from the car with the machete with that intention.  Each of these witnesses, albeit in different ways and with different emphasis, denied that that was the case.  
27The combined effect of their evidence, in the context of all of the evidence at trial, satisfies me that none of them were armed with weapons upon leaving Heatherbrae with the intention of returning to Raymond Terrace to exact revenge for the attack on the red Commodore.  In the result, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only weapon available to the occupants of the blue Commodore was what was described as a ""hunting knife"" located by police in the side pocket of the rear passenger seat of the car when it was seized later that evening.  Thomas Maynard gave evidence that the knife was fortuitously in the side pocket from a previous hunting trip and that he grabbed it on impulse as he followed his brother out of the blue Commodore in Links Drive, concerned that his brother was exposing himself to an angry mob unprotected.  He impressed me as a witness of truth.  I accept his evidence.
28As the deceased and his friends were preparing to return to Raymond Terrace from Heatherbrae in the blue Commodore, in the circumstances as I have found them to be, White returned to the area of Links Drive where he met with the offender and the others in his group who had by that time congregated in a reserve at the end of a nearby street.  Contrary to the offender's evidence, I am satisfied that at this time plans were made for a further attack should the deceased and his friends return to the area and, with that objective, the offender maintained control over the younger men threatening them with violence if they defected.  I am also satisfied that contrary to the offender's evidence (and others in his group who gave evidence) that while they were at the reserve they were each armed with weapons and other implements including, in particular, the machete which I am satisfied Forbes took with him from his home earlier that evening.  The offender admitted that he was armed with the loaded shotgun at this time.  
29As the offender and his group walked from the reserve and down Links Drive towards his brother's house, they used trees on both sides of the street as cover in what was described by one of the witnesses as ""army style"".  Those who were not armed with weapons armed themselves with pieces of broken brick from the front yard of one of the houses in Links Drive.  
30I am also satisfied that Nable was directed by the offender to remain at the corner of Links Drive and Mount Hall Road to keep a lookout so as to alert him by a pre-arranged signal if the red Commodore returned.  When the blue Commodore came to the corner it was either ushered into Links Drive by Nable for the purpose of a surprise attack (I note one of the witnesses in the blue Commodore claimed Nable whistled) or it ventured into the street in order to see whether Nable was in fact associated with the group that had damaged the red Commodore and to ""square up"" with a fist fight were that to prove to be the case. 
31As the blue Commodore travelled down Links Drive it was ambushed by the offender's group hurling pieces of brick and other makeshift missiles 150 metres from the intersection with Mount Hall Road.  Whilst some of the members of the offender's group admitted that the car was ambushed, none of them admitted using bricks.  Others either denied that the attack occurred at all while others feigned no memory, or an imprecise memory, of what they did and what others in their group did.  
32Forbes gave evidence in chief that nobody from his group had any weapons of any kind during the attack.  I am satisfied he was being deliberately untruthful when giving this evidence.  He was cross-examined by the Crown with leave, and agreed with what was recorded in the statement of facts tendered in his sentence proceeding as follows:The vehicle in which the deceased was travelling was stopped in Links Drive by our group including Chad and John Shedden.  The group surrounded and attacked the car in which the deceased was travelling.  The attack included throwing missiles and projectiles at the car and beating the car with some of the weapons the group possessed.  
33No one got out of the blue Commodore when it was attacked as it travelled down Links Drive.  It is not entirely clear where the offender was when it was ambushed but it would appear that he was on that side of the road closest to the passenger side of the blue Commodore as it passed.  The deceased was seated in the front passenger seat.  There is no evidence that the offender drew the shotgun from his jacket sleeve at that time.  Assuming that to be the case, it would appear that he was content to see the blue Commodore ambushed and pelted with missiles, perhaps in the belief that it would retreat as the red Commodore had done earlier.
34However, under the deceased's direction (and despite the urgings of his friends and the unstated wishes of Dillon Bell not to drive back into trouble) after travelling a short distance beyond the site of the attack Bell executed a U-turn and travelled back towards the group.  I have no doubt this was because the deceased intended to confront them and ""square up"" in a fist fight.  That decision and his conduct in getting out of the car was impulsive and reckless, doubtless fuelled by a dangerous mix of anger and alcohol.  The concentration of alcohol in his blood at autopsy was 0.154g per 100ml of blood.  Blood tests also revealed 0.034 mg per litre of blood of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and 0.057mg per litre of Delta-9-THC, consistent with very recent use of cannabis.  
35The blue Commodore either stopped in its forward passage back along Links Drive by people on the road or Bell stopped the car on his own volition or at the deceased's direction.  At that point the driver's window and the passenger window on the driver's side was smashed with a hammer or a similar implement wielded by someone in the offender's group.  Whilst this damage was being inflicted (and while both Bell and Wright were shielding themselves against that attack from inside the car), the deceased got out of the passenger seat and went to the rear of the car closely followed by his brother who had armed himself with the hunting knife before getting out of the rear passenger seat.  
36I reject the offender's evidence that the deceased was armed when he got out of the car and those in his group who gave similar evidence as being either untrue or unreliable.  Their evidence generally as to the events of the night was unsatisfactory.  Each of them, in different ways, understated the level of planning and violence in which they actively participated.  Some displayed a discernible and wholly misplaced partisan attitude towards the offender or others in their group to whom they believed they owed alliance.  I make particular reference in that regard to Daniel Forbes who, despite having been given the benefit of a very considerable reduction in sentence on his undertaking to give truthful evidence, I am satisfied he sought repeatedly to deflect the truth or give a diluted version of it.  
37I have taken into account that Bradley White's evidence was supportive of the Crown case, in particular his evidence that the group who left John Shedden's house were armed during the course of the attacks on both the cars, that the offender was openly belligerent and aggressive throughout the night and, importantly, that the offender drew the shotgun and fired directly at the deceased.  I also accept that to some extent the youngest person in the offender's group, AB, was endeavouring to give truthful evidence.  I am, however, unable to give his evidence or White's evidence that the deceased was armed with a machete sufficient weight as to overwhelm the collective weight of the evidence of the occupants of the blue Commodore to the contrary on this question, or to leave me with a reasonable doubt about it.  I accept that the occupants of the blue Commodore were allied with the deceased and that their evidence may also have been coloured for that reason.  That said, their individual accounts of the events of the night were largely consistent, given to police relatively contemporaneously in lengthy recorded interviews and in some respects given against their interests.  Ultimately, I am satisfied these witnesses gave their evidence with a degree of frankness, expressing themselves with persuasive force, liberally laced with the vernacular, to satisfy me that as to the critical issue in dispute for sentencing purposes they were telling the truth. 
38The deceased was shot in the chest and fell back against the open rear passenger door left open by his brother and without having progressed any distance along the side of the car.  Having regard to the ballistics evidence and the location of a spent cartridge, I am satisfied that the offender fired the shotgun at the deceased over a distance of 6 to 8 metres, that is from the opposite side of the road, and that he did so with the intention of killing him.  A total of 346 pellets of an anticipated load of 350 pellets were removed from the deceased's upper chest at autopsy.  Prior to the shot discharging the deceased's brother heard the offender say ""Maynard I'm going to shoot you.  Fuck off, I am going to shoot you"" and that the gun was pointed straight at him.  White heard him say ""Do you want to get shot?  I'll shoot you.  I'll shoot you, dog"".  Russell heard him say as the gun went off ""You fucking cop that"". 
39After he was shot the deceased was dragged back into the car by his friends and the blue Commodore left the scene.  He died en route to the hospital.  The offender's group dispersed in the interim.  The offender was driven from the scene by White.
40Shortly after midnight a crime scene was declared and a detailed examination of Links Drive undertaken.  Assorted debris consisting of broken bricks and smashed glass was located on Links Road at the site of the second ambush.  A knife, a hammer, the machete and portions of a knife handle were also located.  I am satisfied that these were the discarded weapons used by those in the offender's group.  I am also satisfied that the offender directed his brother to dispose of the shotgun which was later recovered by police with his brother's assistance.  
41The offender was arrested and charged with murder on 13 July 2010.
Objective criminality
42After taking into account the events of the night leading up to the shooting, as I have found them, with the offender, armed with a shortened loaded shotgun, leading a group of young men and boys around suburban streets in Raymond Terrace determined to exact violent revenge on the deceased and his group, and succeeding in achieving that objective on two occasions before discharging that weapon with the stated intention of killing an unarmed person, I regard the objective seriousness of this offending as extremely high.  The offending is further aggravated by the offender's complete disregard for public safety by planning for and executing armed assaults on a car and its occupants in a suburban location (s 21A(2)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act).  I have already taken into account the use of the gun (s 21A(2)(c)) and that the murder was committed in the presence of AB and JB as persons under 18 years of age (s 21A(2)(ea)) in my assessment of the objective criminality that accompanied the offending in this case.
43At the time of the murder the offender was subject to three Court Attendance Notices for a number of traffic offences which were dealt with by the Local Court in April 2010 when he was convicted in his absence.  On his arrest on 13 July 2010 he was sentenced for those offences to an effective non-parole period of 12 months to date from 13 July 2010.  The warrant for his arrest issuing on his failure to appear to answer the traffic charges was relied upon by the Crown as a further feature of aggravation under s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  I do not regard it as a feature of aggravation carrying any weight in this sentencing exercise.  It does however bear upon the date from which his sentence should commence.
44The offender gave evidence on sentence that he is ""sorry"" for having killed the deceased.  I accept that this is some evidence of remorse and that he has some insight into the gravity of his offending and the loss suffered by the deceased's family by reason of his conduct.  For that reason, I am satisfied that his prospects of rehabilitation are not entirely bleak.  I am not persuaded that the deceased's unprovoked assault on Wilson and Forbes earlier in the night operates in mitigation of sentence in the sense comprehended by s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
Subjective circumstances 
45The offender was aged 34 years at the time of sentence.  His criminal record is lengthy, including terms of imprisonment for threatened violence in a domestic context.  There are no firearm offences and no offences of actual violence aside from a common assault in 2000.  Most entries relate to street offences, driving offences and minor offences of dishonesty.   
46His family history, education and work history was supplied to Dr Jacmon for the purposes of preparing his report.  It can be summarised as follows.  He is the second oldest of five brothers who grew up in a supportive family environment in Newcastle.  He attended a local primary and high school.  He was placed in a special class in high school with a primary focus on a non-academic curriculum.  He left school without attaining his School Certificate although he did achieve a certificate in welding in Year 10.  He has worked in a chicken processing plant, in a sales position at a supermarket and, in the months prior to the offence, as a traffic controller during road maintenance works. 
47He has two children of a previous relationship and a current de facto relationship.  He reported seeing his own children whenever he can and that his de facto partner and her children visit him regularly in custody.
48Dr Jacmon reports that the offender has diagnosed cognitive deficits with his verbal IQ recorded at the mild retardation level and his overall IQ assessed at the borderline level between low average and mild retardation.  His reading and comprehension skills were assessed at the level of year three with testing indicating the likelihood of brain damage.  This was not confirmed by any neurological report.  I have no information as to whether the brain damage was organic or trauma-based.  Dr Jacmon also recorded a finding of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder which, at the time of the murder, was in his view further impaired by substance abuse from the combined use of ice, marijuana and alcohol since his mid-adolescence.  The offender reported using three quarters of a gram of ice and 700 mls of bourbon on the day of the murder.  I note that he gave evidence before the jury that he had consumed that quantity of alcohol which he regarded as not unusual.  Unsurprisingly, he made no reference at trial to his drug use.
49In Dr Jacmon's view, the range of cognitive impairments, confirmed on clinical assessment, indicated a markedly diminished capacity in the offender for judgment or rational decision making and what Dr Jacmon described as ""a failure to apply common sense to thought processes"" resulting in a compromised appreciation of the consequences of particular conduct.  
50The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 13 July 2010.  Ms Davenport submitted that although he has had visits whilst in custody, his custodial situation is such that he has been isolated for lengthy periods for the past two years and this will likely continue for the foreseeable future.  The offender gave evidence at the sentence hearing that he has been housed in a non-association cell to afford him protection against threats that have been made against him whilst in prison and because of an attack from another prisoner where he sustained a head injury. 
51He also gave evidence that he is only released from his cell to make phone calls and has no daily contact with anybody save for Corrective Services officers who deliver his meals.  Ms Davenport submitted that his isolation in the prison system is exacerbated by his functional illiteracy.  The offender gave evidence that although he has a desire to undertake courses whilst in custody to improve his literacy and numeracy, he is currently unable to access any educational material or facilities that might assist him.
52I accept that without some extended supervision by the parole service upon his release his personal circumstances are unlikely to improve.  In light of the length of sentence to be imposed, however, I am not persuaded that any extension of the parole period would enhance the offender's prospects of rehabilitation.  Ms Davenport did not submit otherwise.  I would, of course, encourage the offender to undertake all courses offered to him whilst in custody which might improve his skill base.  I also recommend that when the conditions of his custody permit it, that he be given access to appropriate facilities in the prison system where his illiteracy and innumeracy, and his cognitive deficits, can be addressed by appropriate support.  
Parity
53Daniel Forbes was sentenced by Harrison J for his role in the manslaughter of the deceased to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months (R v Forbes [2011] NSWSC 1547).  The offender's brother was sentenced by me to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months (R v Shedden [2012] NSWSC 759).
54In accordance with settled authority, Ms Davenport did not submit that the principles of parity apply in the sentence to be imposed on this offender.
Sentence
55The statutory maximum of life imprisonment for murder under s 19A(1) of the Crimes Act reflects the fact that the taking of human life is regarded as among the most serious of crimes.  The community has the legitimate expectation that any sentence imposed against that statutory maximum will reflect the allied sentencing principles of denunciation and punishment.  
56I have already noted that a standard non-parole period of 20 years is provided for in Div 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The approach to sentence in these circumstances does not require me to assess whether this offending is in, or above, the mid range of objective seriousness.  I do note, however, as I am obliged to do, that the standard non-parole period of 20 years represents the period an offender should spend in custody for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness without regard to aggravating or mitigating factors that might apply in an individual case.  Furthermore, I am not required to identify any reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, but rather to assess the objective seriousness of the offence of murder by reference to all relevant factors and to review the offender's subjective circumstances by the same analysis in order to reach a judgment as to the appropriate sentence acknowledging that a standard non-parole period of 20 years has been fixed by the Parliament for murder, in the mid range, after trial.
57In this case I am satisfied that the murder of the deceased reflects a very high degree of criminality.  The offender's conduct in planning for and leading an armed attack of the kind that was launched (and on two separate occasions on the one night in a suburban street) which culminated in the death of a young man must attract a sentence capable of deterring others from behaviour of the kind in which these two groups of men participated as well as punishing the offender for murdering the deceased and denouncing his conduct publicly.  The gravity of his conduct is untempered by any matters in mitigation.  I was not invited by counsel to find that his cognitive deficits or his behavioural disorder bear any causative connection to the murder, which otherwise might have allowed me to afford considerations of general deterrence less weight.  That said, I have taken his subjective circumstances and his compromised intellectual ability, coupled with the sequelae of substance abuse over many years, into account in the sentencing exercise.  I am not unmindful of the need for the sentence that I impose to carry with it the expectation that he will take steps to address his rehabilitation during the term of his imprisonment and that the prison system will afford him that opportunity.
58Chad Ross Shedden, for the murder of Joshua Maynard I sentence you to imprisonment for 27 years commencing on 13 July 2011 comprising a non-parole period of 20 years expiring on 12 July 2031 and a balance of term of 7 years expiring on 12 July 2038.
For the offence of possessing a shortened firearm contrary to s 62(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1996 which I have been asked to deal with by the Crown's tender of a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, I impose a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 13 July 2011.
Accordingly, the earliest date you are eligible for release to parole is 12 July 2031.

2759781,De Celis (Election Funding Authority) v Lindsay Bennelong Developments [2012] NSWSC 917,"Judgment
1By summons filed on 24 February 2012 the Election Funding Authority commenced proceedings against the defendant pursuant to s 91 of the Election Funding and Disclosures Act 1981.  That provision, created the offence of failing to lodge a declaration in relation to a reportable political donation, that is a sum equal to or more than $1,000. 
2The defendant has admitted the offence.  The circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence require some explanation not least because they bear upon the penalty to be imposed.   
3On 30 July 2008 the defendant donated $2,000 to the Liberal Party of Australia, the New South Wales Division for the purposes of the ""Elect Sydney Liberals the Shayne Mallard Campaign"" for Sydney Council.  The funds were used towards the campaign costs of the Local Government elections of the Sydney Council in September 2008. 4On 4 September 2008 the defendant donated $25,000 to Mayor Patrick Reilly for the purposes of his election campaign in the Willoughby City Council elections of September 2008.
5Also on 4 September 2008 the defendant donated $20,000 to Councillor Stuart Coppock for the purposes of his election to Willoughby City Council in September 2008. 
6These three donations each fell within the definition of a ""reportable political donation"" under the Act.  The Act required disclosure in the form of a declaration to be made within eight weeks of the relevant disclosure period.  Each of the three beneficiaries of these donations lodged declarations with the authority.  However, the defendant did not lodge declarations.  It was required to do so by 26 February 2009.
7Between 1 January 2009 and 2 February 2009, the Authority conducted an audit of recipients of donations.  The defendant was identified as a donor which had not lodged a declaration.  On or about 2 February 2009 the Authority sent a letter to the defendant to remind it of its obligations under the Act.  It is common ground that the defendant did not receive this letter.  
8On or about 21 May 2009 the authority carried out another audit, and again, identified the defendant as a donor which had not lodged a declaration.  The Authority sent a letter to the defendant on 21 May 2009.  This letter was received.  The defendant completed a declaration but, through an oversight, the declaration was not sent.  On 17 October 2011, the Authority notified the defendant of the commencement of an investigation into its failure to lodge a declaration in 2009.  Following further correspondence the defendant lodged a declaration on 29 November 2011.   9The commencement of the prosecution about three months later might be legitimately considered by the defendant as something of an overreaction to its tardiness.  It must be accepted that the legislative purposes underlying the Act are critical to the integrity of the democratic system and that the failure to disclose political donations strikes at the heart of any democracy.  The Authority exercises a function that maintains and enforces a transparent mechanism for political donations.
10However, as with all prosecutorial authorities the Electoral Funding Authority has a broad range of discretionary powers.  It is not obliged to prosecute in every instance of a breach of s 91 of the Act.  It may issue warnings, penalty notices, seek recovery of the donations or enter compliance agreements with recalcitrant donors.  
11The Authority's decision to prosecute in this case was motivated, it is submitted, by the size of the donations and the fact that the defendant is a property developer which had failed to respond to the Authority's letters advising it of its statutory obligations.  Whether those factors warrant the decision to prosecute in this Court rather than in the Local Court or at all, is beyond the scope of these proceedings.  The discretion to prosecute having been exercised, this Court is only concerned with issues of sentencing. 
12Of particular relevance to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence is the culpability of the defendant.  It is conceded that the defendant was not dishonest or wilfully contumelious in the commission of the offence.  Rather there was a regrettable measure of recklessness in the defendant's compliance with its statutory obligation. 
13True it is that the defendant initially received legal advice in September 2008 to the effect that it was not required to lodge a declaration.  However, it became aware in May 2009 that that advice was incorrect and it completed a declaration yet failed to lodge it.  It is also correct to observe that the donation in combination was not a trivial amount. 
14As against these factors the Authority's failure to take any action for two years and four months after the defendant was prompted to complete a declaration contributed to the defendant's default,  in the sense that the company's responsible officer's belief that the declaration had been lodged subsisted over that period of time. 
15Such a delay in instituting proceedings can not be satisfactorily explained.  If as the Authority maintains, it was important for reasons of general deterrence to prosecute this offence,  one might expect a greater degree of diligence.  The leisurely pace of the decision making process is unlikely to convey to the general public a sense of the gravity of the offence.  It mitigates the penalty otherwise appropriate to the offence because the defendant now stands to be punished for conduct that occurred over three years ago.  Since that time it has taken responsibility for the offence and is genuinely contrite.
16It is not suggested that the donations were designed to, or did in fact, influence any decision making process on the part of anyone exercising powers with respect to property developments undertaken or to be undertaken by the defendant.  In my view that does little to ameliorate the defendant's conduct.  If the donation were made with that object in mind it would aggravate the offence.  However, the legislation strikes at the fact of an undeclared donation because it is the appearance of influence of public officials that arises from such donations and which damages public confidence in the democratic process. 
17In all these circumstances the objective gravity of the offence is not of a high order but nor is it so low on the scale of objective seriousness that the defendant ought to receive the benefit of s 10A of the Crime (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999.  In my view a conviction ought be recorded.  The monetary penalty to be imposed is however affected by the excessive delay on the part of the prosecution. 
18Taking all of these matters into account, I proceed to sentence as follows.  The defendant company is convicted.  I fine the defendant company $6,000, half of which is to be paid to the prosecutor pursuant to s 122 of the Fines Act 1996.  I make no order as to costs.

2759815,Kable v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 243,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

From February to August 1995 the appellant was held in a New South Wales prison in accordance with an order made by a Supreme Court judge, on an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions, purportedly under the Community Protection Act 1994 (NSW). That Act permitted a detention order to be made in respect of the appellant (and no one else) if a judge were satisfied that he was likely to commit a serious act of violence and it was appropriate to hold him in custody. The appellant successfully challenged the constitutional validity of the Act in the High Court. The High Court held that the Act was inimical to the exercise of judicial power. It was wholly invalid, as were all of the steps taken under it.

In 1996 the appellant commenced the current proceedings, seeking damages arising from the conduct of the State and its officers in bringing proceedings against him and for detaining him for a period of six months solely on the basis of the detention order made under the invalid Act.

On 9 November 2009 a trial commenced before Hoeben J. The claim involved three causes of action, being abuse of process, malicious prosecution and false imprisonment. Hoeben J held that there was no case to go to a jury in respect of any of the three causes of action.

On 1 November 2010 Mr Kable appealed from that decision, as of right, to this Court. The issues for determination on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in dismissing the claim in respect of:

(i) malicious prosecution,
(ii) abuse of process, and
(iii) false imprisonment, and in particular:

(a) whether the order protected the State from liability, and 
(b) whether the persons giving effect to the order enjoyed protection from liability.

The Court held, allowing the appeal in part:

In relation to (i) and (ii)
(per Basten JA, Allsop P, Campbell and Meagher JJA and McClellan CJ at CL agreeing)

1. There was no basis for finding that the Director of Public Prosecutions commenced the proceedings for any purpose other than that revealed by the legislation, nor that, applying the standards contained in the Community Protection Act, there were not reasonable grounds for seeking the order provided by the Act. The possibility that the Act exceeded the constitutional powers of the legislature could not of itself turn otherwise legitimate proceedings into a malicious prosecution: [111]-[112]

A v State of New South Wales [2007] HCA 10; 230 CLR 500 applied.

2. Malice on the part of the Parliament could not be established. It is not open to a litigant to impugn the motives of the Parliament. To provide compensation for those who suffer from a purported, but unconstitutional, legislative act is to confer a right to compensation based on unconstitutionality, in the absence of any common law tort: [114]

Bill of Rights 1688 (Imp); O'Chee v Rowley (1997) 142 FLR 1; Street v Hearne [2007] NSWCA 113; 70 NSWLR 231; James v The Commonwealth [1939] HCA 9; 62 CLR 339 applied.

In relation to (iii)(a)
(per Allsop P, Campbell and Meagher JJA and McClellan CJ at CL agreeing)

3. Neither the enquiries as to whether the making of the orders was an act of a judicial character and whether the orders were judicial orders, nor the conclusions that they were, is open to this Court. The High Court has decided these questions: [17]

Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51 applied, Residual Assco Group Ltd v Spalvins [2000] HCA 33; 202 CLR 629; Haskins v Commonwealth [2011] HCA 28; 244 CLR 22 referred to.

4. The conception of an order of a superior court carrying with it the presumptions of jurisdictional authority and validity has within it the further assumption of the judicial character of the act of making the order. The order of the Court did not have the attendant characteristic of validity as an order of a superior court of record, until set aside: [18], [21]

Love v Attorney-General (NSW) [1990] HCA 4; 169 CLR 307 applied, Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49; 192 CLR 69; Grollo v Palmer [1995] HCA 26; 184 CLR 348 referred to.

(per Basten JA)

5. The principle that an order of a superior court has effect until set aside depends on the order being made in the exercise of judicial power by a superior court: [139]-[141], [155]-[160]

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11; 209 CLR 597, Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal [1999] HCA 19; 198 CLR 435; United Telecasters Sydney Ltd v Hardy (1991) 23 NSWLR 323; Attorney-General (NSW) v Mayas Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 342; Love v Attorney-General (NSW) [1990] HCA 4; 169 CLR 307 applied; Peters v Attorney General (NSW) (1988) 16 NSWLR 24 referred to.

6. The order was an invalid non-judicial order, and was not rendered an exercise of judicial power by the exercise of federal judicial power in determining the constitutional challenge to the Community Protection Act: [149]-[153]

Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51 applied; Residual Assco Group Ltd v Spalvins [2000] HCA 33; 202 CLR 629; Felton v Mulligan [1971] HCA 39; 124 CLR 367; referred to; Re Macks; Ex parte Saint [2000] HCA 62; 204 CLR 158 distinguished.

In relation to (iii)(b)
(per Allsop P, Campbell and Meagher JJA and McClellan CJ at CL agreeing)

7. There is no basis for extending the protection of an officer from tortious liability when enforcing a judicial order of a court, valid on its face, to an order which is a wholly invalid exercise of non-judicial power of the kind described by the High Court in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51: [42]

Robertson (1997) 92 A Crim R 115 distinguished.

8. Because the gaoler required the statutory protection of a provision of a statute such as Prisons Act 1952 (NSW), s 46, the operation of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW), s 10, will mean that the State is vicariously liable: [57]

(per Basten JA)

9. Given the statutory protection once provided by the Constables Protection Act 1750 (Imp) and the Prisons Act 1952 (NSW), it is implausible that any common law principle now operates to provide protection in respect of the execution of orders purportedly made under statutory authority (and no other authority): [164]-[165]

Love v Attorney-General (NSW) [1990] HCA 4; 169 CLR 307 applied.

10. The Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW), s 8 imposes vicarious liability on the State for conduct which would have been a tort, absent statutory protection. Further, s 8 removed the State's immunity for the acts of officers exercising independent functions. Whatever statutory protection the gaoler may have enjoyed did not enure to the benefit of the State, by operation of s 10: [166], [170]




			Judgment

1ALLSOP P: I have read the reasons of Basten JA. I agree with his reasons as to abuse of process and malicious prosecution. I also agree in substance with his reasons as to false imprisonment. Thus, I agree with the orders which his Honour proposes. Given the importance of the conclusion on the claim for false imprisonment and of the reasons therefor, I would prefer to express in my own words why this claim should not be struck out.

2The first matter to keep firmly in mind in considering the operation of the law in Australia, both general and statutory, is that it takes its place and shape by reference to the fundamental law of the Constitution. Thus, when one is considering the content of rules of common law, or the proper construction of statutes, the foundational concepts and demands of the Constitution are ever present as informing, and sometimes shaping, norms: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; 189 CLR 520 at 566.

3In Kable v The Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of New South Wales [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51, orders were made allowing the appeal and setting aside the orders of this Court. In place of those orders the appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed, and the order of Levine J was set aside with consequential costs orders. The decision of the majority (Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) was that the relevant provisions of the Community Protection Act 1994 (NSW) (the ""CP Act"") were unconstitutional. The essential reasoning of the four justices for that conclusion of unconstitutionality included reliance upon the proposition that the Supreme Court was not exercising judicial power or authority and was not acting, institutionally, as a superior court but was acting, effectively, in an executive function (beyond that which is permissibly ancillary to the exercise of judicial power), as an instrument of the Executive: Toohey J at 98; Gaudron J at 103-104, 106, 107 and 108; McHugh J at 109, 121-122, Gummow J at 127-128, 132, 133-134, 137, 141 and 143. It is unnecessary to set out in full the views of their Honours. It suffices to refer to the following. Toohey J (at 98) described the CP Act as having an ""extraordinary character"" and his Honour said that the acts performed by the Court under it were non-judicial functions and were of such a nature ""that public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary as an institution ... is diminished"". Gaudron J (at 106 and 108) described the proceedings contemplated by the CP Act, despite the attempt to ""dress them up as legal proceedings"", as ""not in any way partak[ing] of the nature of legal proceedings"", as ""the antithesis of the judicial process"" and as ""mak[ing] a mockery of [the judicial] process"". McHugh J (at 122) described the involvement of the Court as ""the exercise of non-judicial functions"" and the Court ""as the instrument of a legislative plan, initiated by the executive government, to imprison [Mr Kable] by a process that is far removed from the judicial process..."". Gummow J (at 132) described the authority purported to be conferred on the Court by the CP Act as ""non-judicial in nature [and] repugnant to the judicial process in a fundamental degree."" His Honour (at 134) described the CP Act as ""an extraordinary piece of legislation"" and its form being such as to make the ""judiciary ... apt to be seen as but an arm of the executive which implements the will of the legislature.""

4These are not expressions of matters res inter alios acta. These are not findings of fact sought to be utilised impermissibly in another proceeding contrary to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 91. These are the conclusions of the majority of the High Court justices essential to the reasoning as to the unconstitutionality of the statute in Mr Kable's suit against the Director. The State of New South Wales appeared in Kable by and through the Solicitor General. The reasoning stands as determinative of the character of the ""orders"" of this Court and of the character of the functions, processes and authority exercised or purported to be exercised by this Court in 1995.

Orders of a superior court of record?

5The first basis upon which the State of New South Wales relies to defeat Mr Kable's claim for false imprisonment is that the orders of the Court that led to his incarceration, until Grove J refused to make an order continuing his imprisonment, were orders of a superior court of record and thus valid and effective until set aside. To use a convenient legal label, the orders were voidable and not void. Thus, judged by reference to the time when the acts were performed by the gaoler, and vicariously the State, the imprisonment of Mr Kable was lawful, being supported by a then valid and subsisting order. This argument depends for its success on the ascription of this consequence to an order under the CP Act. 

6The character of an order of a superior court of record such as the Supreme Court of New South Wales is that it has effect until set aside: Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5; 68 CLR 571 at 590-591, Re Macks; Ex parte Saint [2000] HCA 62; 204 CLR 158, and other cases referred to by Gaudron J in Re Macks at 184 [49], fn 80. This is because, at common law, a legal presumption is made about the general jurisdiction of a superior court and the validity of its orders until set aside: Peacock v Bell and Kendal (1667) 1 Wms Saund 73 at 74; 85 ER 84 at 87-88.

7The Federal Court of Australia is not a court of general jurisdiction, but is a superior court of record. Its jurisdictional authority is circumscribed by the Constitution, ss 75 and 76: Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27; 198 CLR 511; and by the statutes that confer jurisdiction upon it under the Constitution, s 77(i). Nevertheless, the circumscription of its jurisdiction by reference to the terms of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution did not deny the binding nature of a decision (erroneous in fact: Re Wakim) that the Federal Court had jurisdiction and of an order under that (wrongfully) assumed jurisdiction, until set aside. This was so, not through the direct or naked operation of a common law presumption, but through the conception of a superior court of record as the subject of the operation of ss 71, 76(ii), 77(i) and 51(xxxix), or ss 76(i), 76(ii) and 77(i) of the Constitution: Re Macks at 177-178 [19]-[23], 185-187 [51]-[57], 235-237 [214]-[220], 247-249 [253]-[256] (as to the former) and at 279 [343]-[344] (as to the latter).

8Although this controversy is one to be quelled within federal jurisdiction (because of the operation of s 76(i) of the Constitution), we are not concerned here with the type of limits of jurisdiction arising out of the reach of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution as lay at the heart of Re Macks. That is important for at least one reason. The constitutional deficiency under consideration in Re Macks was not concerned with the Federal Court exercising non-judicial power. Rather, it was with the Federal Court exercising judicial power, in the general sense, but beyond that which Ch III of the Constitution permitted Parliament to confer upon it by reference to ss 75 and 76 and to the word ""matter"". The order of the Federal Court in Re Macks that was valid until set aside was a judicial act, though without constitutionally founded jurisdiction. See generally Kable at 136-137 per Gummow J.

9In due course, it will be necessary to examine the question whether the binding effect of an order of a superior court until set aside depends upon the order being an exercise of power that is judicial in character or, if non-judicial, being ancillary or incidental to the exercise of judicial power. I do not use the phrase ""judicial power"" in the sense confined by Ch III of the Constitution: cf Gummow J in Kable at 136-137. Also, the use of the expression is not intended to overlook the distinction made by the Court (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) in Love v Attorney-General (NSW) [1990] HCA 4; 169 CLR 307 at 321 between the character of the power and acting under the power:

""However, the conclusion that the power to issue warrants pursuant to s. 16 of the State Act is not judicial is not decisive of the question whether or not the act of issuing a warrant is itself judicial.""

10For now, I will assume that question to be answered in the affirmative, and proceed to examine whether the order is a judicial act and whether the making of the order was an exercise of judicial power in the sense above described.

11In Love, it was necessary to ascertain whether the act of issuing the warrant was judicial in character in order that the effect of the warrant be ascertained. At 318 the Court said:

""It is first necessary, in order to consider the operation of the warrant, to determine whether the act of issuing it is judicial or administrative in nature. If the issuing of the warrant is an administrative act, then the ambit of the warrant must be determined in the light of the scope of the power conferred upon the court by the statute. On that footing the ultimate effect of the warrant depends upon the construction of the power and of the warrant itself. The construction of the warrant may give rise to a question of severance. On the other hand, if the act of issuing a warrant is judicial in nature, then the warrant takes on the attributes of a judicial order. In that event, the appellants argue that the warrants in the present case are judicial orders issued in excess of jurisdiction and as such they cannot be severed or read down. Accordingly, they must be declared void and set aside. That is how the argument runs."" (emphasis added)

12That recitation of the argument by the Court should be qualified by the record of the argument of Mr Handley QC and Ms Beazley, as they then were, set out at 309:
""The warrants were judicial orders .... Accordingly the jurisdiction is to be treated as an addition to the Court's ordinary jurisdiction and all the usual incidents follow .... The declaration made by the Court of Appeal is inappropriate if the warrants are judicial orders. Orders of the Supreme Court cannot be declared void ab initio..."" (emphasis added)

13Thus, the argument in Love involved, in part, the consequence of an order of a superior court being valid until set aside. The question whether the order had that character and whether consequences flowed from it were analysed by reference to whether the act was judicial in character or not. In doing so, their Honours first raised, and then put to one side, the ""loose sense"" in which one could say it was a judicial act - by its being an instrument issued by a judge of the Supreme Court. That, however, did not stamp it with the character of a judicial order ""unless the warrant issues as a result of a determination made by the judge in his or her judicial capacity"" (at 319). Their Honours recognised the difficulty of comprehensive definition of judicial power, though its broad elements were identified by Griffith CJ in Huddart, Parker & Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead [1909] HCA 36; 8 CLR 330 at 357, and their Honours noted the observations of Kitto J in R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte Tasmanian Breweries Ltd [1970] HCA 8; 123 CLR 361 at 374-375 (see Love at 319-320). After considering the exercise of the power, their Honours concluded at 321-322:

""Although the administrative power to issue a warrant is in terms conferred upon the court rather than the several judges of the court, the exercise of the power is essentially administrative in nature. The warrant is the outcome of a complaint upon which the judge must bring his or her judicial mind to bear and decide on the material before him or her whether the warrant should issue. The judge is under a duty to act judicially and to that extent the issue of the warrant is a judicial act but it is not a 'judicial act in the same sense as is an adjudication to determine the rights of parties', to use the words of Windeyer J. in Electronic Rentals. It is not an order inter partes from which a party whose conversations may be overheard has a right of appeal. To adapt the language used in Hilton v. Wells, under s. 16 a judge makes no order and nothing that he or she does is enforced as an order of the court. Therefore, if a warrant is granted, its effect depends entirely upon the State Act."" (citations omitted)

14Having come to that conclusion, the Court said at 322-323:

""Once it is accepted that the warrant is not a judicial order, it becomes an instrument made pursuant to a circumscribed statutory authority.""

15This was a conclusion that the issue of the warrants was not a judicial act and thus not an order of a superior court with the relevant consequences that flow from that.

16Here, the State pointed to the features of the making of the orders by Hunter J and Levine J that were said to characterise the exercise of the power as judicial and the order as a judicial order. Reference was made to its form as an order of the Court and to the manner in which the judges concerned conducted hearings and referred to material before them in an exercise redolent of judicial activity. In Love, the fact that the power was conferred on the Court was ""of limited significance"" (Gummow J in Grollo v Palmer [1995] HCA 26; 184 CLR 348 at 389) in the determination of the character of the act. It is a factor that is not determinative. 

17Neither the enquiries as to whether the making of the orders was an act of a judicial character and whether the orders were judicial orders, nor the conclusions that they were, are open to this Court. The High Court in Kable has decided these questions. That is not to impugn the integrity of the judges who undertook these tasks or to overlook the diligence and care with which they attended to the tasks that they considered to be required of them by the CP Act. The descriptions of the character of the power in the CP Act and the functions exercising it in the judgments of the majority in Kable, epitomised by the expressions of the matter set out in [3] above, resolve these questions of the characterisation of the power being exercised and of the acts of exercise of the power. It would be in the teeth of the majority's views in Kable to describe these as judicial orders of a superior court of record or the act of making them judicial, in any relevant sense of judicial capacity. The posited Supreme Court orders here (those of Hunter J and Levine J) had their legal source in the CP Act found to be unconstitutional. The decision of the High Court in Kable was to the effect that the CP Act was (and always was) invalid and of no operative effect to create or affect rights or obligations or to vest lawful authority in a court to act pursuant to it: Residual Assco Group Ltd v Spalvins [2000] HCA 33; 202 CLR 629 at 653 [58]-[59] and cases there cited; Haskins v Commonwealth [2011] HCA 28; 244 CLR 22 at 847-848 [45]-[46]. For the above reasons, the orders cannot be characterised as judicial orders or the result of any exercise of judicial power.

18Does this last conclusion deprive them of the incident of orders of a superior court of record: that is valid until set aside? The reasoning in Love, to which I have already referred, gives an affirmative answer to this question. If an act of a court, including a superior court, is not relevantly of a judicial character but administrative (and not properly ancillary to the exercise of judicial power), it falls to be analysed otherwise than by reference to the attributes of a judicial order and only by reference to the authority conferred by the underlying Act. In this case, the latter was no authority at all. This conclusion is implicit in what I might call the Cameron v Cole cases. They are all cases concerning orders of courts. No issue arose in most of them as to whether an order of the court was judicial in character. In almost all cases that question will go without saying; after all, that is what courts do in their function of exercising the judicial arm of government. In Australia, this power is exercised as part of an integrated court system, recognised by, and tied into, the operation of the Constitution. The power is of a distinctive kind, involving the application of judicial method to the resolution of disputes, by reference to irreducible conceptions of fairness and justice. That distinctive power provides the foundation for the carrying on of the third branch of government in resolving disputes and declaring the law, and for the confidence of the public (the society served by the polity's government, including its judicial branch) that that distinctive power is exercised impartially and independently. Judicial power is not limited to the notion of jurisdiction, that is, the authority to decide. As the Court said in Love, judicial power is not susceptible of comprehensive definition. Whatever may be the elements of essence and context that lead to the insusceptibility of such institutional power in society to a priori definition, the conception of an order of a superior court carrying with it the presumptions of jurisdictional authority and validity has within it the further assumption of the judicial character of the act of making the order. 

19In Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49; 192 CLR 69 at 100-1 and 107, McHugh J said:

""A warrant issued under the Act is far removed from the exercise of the judicial power of the Supreme Court, the County Court and the Magistrates' Courts of Victoria. Its issue is an administrative, not a judicial act. In Love v Attorney-General (NSW), this Court held that a judge considering an application for a warrant under legislation similar to the Act does not perform a judicial function and is bound to act judicially only in the sense that he or she must act in a just and fair manner and with judicial detachment. Warrants issued under the Act cannot be distinguished from the warrants considered in Love.

Once the issuing of a warrant is classified as an administrative act, a person affected by that act may seek judicial review of it and have it declared void or set aside by an appropriate court or tribunal. Furthermore, since the prevailing theory is that an administrative act or order made outside jurisdiction is void, a litigant, affected by the act or order, may challenge it collaterally. In Posner v Collector for Inter-State Destitute Persons (Vict), Dixon J pointed out that: 

'when a party is entitled as of right upon a proper proceeding to have an order set aside or quashed, he may safely ignore it, at all events, for most purposes. It is, accordingly, natural to speak of it as a nullity whether it is void or voidable, and, indeed, it appears almost customary to do so.'

...

In Carmody v Mackellar [(1996) 68 FCR 265], a case concerned with the issue of warrants pursuant to the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 (Cth), Merkel J expressed the view, correctly in my opinion, that Love removed any previous doubt about a trial judge's jurisdiction to entertain a collateral attack on the issue of a warrant under those two Acts or similar legislation. His Honour attributed that doubt at least in part to 'the special position of judicial or court orders, particularly in a superior court of record'. Merkel J quoted the following statement made by this Court in Love [at 322-323]: '[o]nce it is accepted that the warrant is not a judicial order, it becomes an instrument made pursuant to a circumscribed statutory authority.' 

His Honour went on to say: 

'it must be open to a trial court in which the issue of validity ... arises, to hear and determine that issue ... The fact that the warrant was issued by a judicial officer is of no relevance to the broad jurisdiction of the trial court to determine that there has been jurisdictional error.'

...

In the case of superior courts, the common law presumed until the contrary was shown that a judicial order had been made regularly."" (emphasis added; some citations omitted) 

20The description by McHugh J in the last extract of the kind of order that carries the presumption of regularity as ""judicial"" flowed from his Honour's reasoning, which was based on the reasoning in Love. See also in Ousley, Toohey J at 80, Gaudron J at 87, Gummow J at 131 and Kirby J (in dissent) at 145. See also Grollo v Palmer at 360 and 389.

21The order of the Court did not have the attendant characteristic of validity as an order of a superior court of record, until set aside. That basis of protection of the State fails.

A principle at common law protecting anyone who relies on the order of the Supreme Court here? 

22The second basis upon which the State relies to defeat Mr Kable's claim for false imprisonment is the existence, it was submitted, of a common law principle that, whether or not the order was of a superior court, persons who obey court orders are protected from suit. The breadth of the proposition makes one immediately pause for thought, in particular in the light of what was said by Simpson ACJ in Feather v Rogers (1909) 9 SR (NSW) 192 at 197:

""It is no doubt very hard upon police officers who are bound to execute the warrants of Justices, that they should be made liable for so doing on the ground that the Justice issuing the warrant exceeded his jurisdiction. It is very hard on laymen that they should have to take the risk of the warrant being irregular. It is more important, however, that the law should be upheld, notwithstanding the liability of constables and other persons.

It was because of this hardship that the Act 24 Geo. II. c. 44, s. 6, was passed"". 

23The statute mentioned by Simpson ACJ was the Constables Protection Act 1750 (the ""1750 Act"") which by s 6 gave protection to ""any constable, headborough or other officer, or ... any person or persons acting by his order and in his aid, for any thing done in obedience to any warrant under the hand or seal of any justice of the peace"". The statute was repealed in New South Wales by the Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 (NSW).

24Before examining whether this rule exists, and, if it does, its reach and underpinnings, it is necessary to dispose of a related, but clearly distinct principle, which is not determinative of the present position. Whilst no one can be liable under an unconstitutional or repealed statute, if a person be convicted before unconstitutionality is recognised or before repeal occurs, liability merges in and depends on the conviction and not the statute, and does not lapse. The operation of the conviction does not depend upon the law creating the offence, but upon the judgment or sentence of the competent (not necessarily superior) court: Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan [1931] HCA 34; 46 CLR 73 at 106; R v Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990 at 995. The legal theory and policy underpinning this approach was lucidly explained by Street CJ in Unger at 995-996-stability in the operation of the legal system, but in a manner that facilitates the incremental moulding of the law in the light of changing social context; finality and stability in past decisions permitting flexibility in the development of legal principle. We are not dealing here, however, with conviction according to ""the authority belonging to a judgment or sentence of a competent court"" (Dignan at 106) here. Rather, we are dealing with the non-judicial incarceration of a person, without valid statutory foundation, ""dressed up"" as legal proceedings, in a process repugnant and antithetical to legal proceedings and to the exercise of judicial power.

25The posited common law principle, having its source in Dr Drury's Case (1610) 8 Co Rep 141b at 143a; 77 ER 688 at 691, is that if acts are done in accordance with a judicial order, later set aside, they are protected as ""acts done in the execution of justice, which are compulsive"". This passage was cited in Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Cavanough [1935] HCA 45; 53 CLR 220 at 225, where Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said:

""Acts done according to the exigency of a judicial order afterwards reversed are protected: they are 'acts done in the execution of justice, which are compulsive' (Dr. Drury's Case). And proceedings which, although based upon a judgment, are brought to completion before its reversal are not avoided. For 'collateral acts executory are barred, but not collateral acts executed' (Dr. Drury's Case)."" (citations omitted)

26In MacIntosh v Lobel (1993) 30 NSWLR 441, Kirby P said at 459-60:

""It is a well-known principle of the common law that a judgment reversed is the same as no judgment: see, eg, Coleridge J in R v Drury (1849) 3 Car & K 190 at 199; 175 ER 516 at 520. Equally, acts done according to the exigency of a judicial order, afterwards reversed, are protected. They are 'acts done in the execution of justice, which are compulsive': see Commissioner for Railways (New South Wales) v Cavanough (1935) 53 CLR 220 at 225. At least in respect of the orders of a superior court, proceedings which are based upon a judgment, later reversed, and which are brought to completion before its reversal are not thereby avoided: see Re Goldburg (No 2); Ex parte Page [1912] 1 KB 606 at 610.""

27The above expressions of principle can be seen to be rooted in the order and underlying process being judicial.

28In London Corporation v Cox (1867) LR 2 HL 239 at 269, Willes J said the following on the position of the garnishee, who pays under compulsion of the attachment issued without jurisdiction, at the suit of his own creditor:

""In such a case, although the proceeding in the Mayor's Court was wrong, yet the garnishee, not being party or privy to the wrong, and paying honestly in obedience to process of law apparently valid, has the same protection as an officer who executes process apparently regular, without knowing of the want of jurisdiction; and who, not being in a condition to resist, is protected, not because the proceeding was well founded, but notwithstanding it was ill founded: Westoby v. Day; Wood v. Dunn. This very distinction between the Plaintiff in the inferior Court and the garnishee, 'who is a third party, and no way privy,' was pointed out in the case relied upon by Mr. Pollock: Banks v. Self."" (citations omitted)

29Whilst Willes J referred to the apparent validity of the process, it was nevertheless the ""process of law"" that was being referred to. The invalid orders were garnishee orders, invalid exercises of power judicial in character or sufficiently close and connected to be described as processes of the law.

30Posner v Collector for Inter-State Destitute Persons (Victoria) [1946] HCA 50; 74 CLR 461 concerned an invalid order for maintenance. The facts were summarised by Latham CJ at 465-6 as follows:

""On 16th January 1946 Mordka Hirsch Posner was served in Victoria with a certificate of a maintenance order which had been made against him in Perth, Western Australia, on 24th October 1941. On the same day a demand was made upon him by the Collector for Inter-State Destitute Persons for payment of £438 arrears due under the order. On 18th January 1946 a summons (in the form prescribed by regulations made under the Maintenance Acts 1928-1938 (Vict.)) was issued calling upon him to show cause why he should not be imprisoned for failure to pay moneys in accordance with the order. Upon the hearing of the summons Posner satisfied the Court of Petty Sessions, Melbourne, that he had not been served with any process relating to the proceedings in Western Australia and that he had become aware only on 16th January 1946 of the order which had been made in Perth in 1941. The court was of opinion that the order was a nullity, but that under the Victorian Act it was bound to give effect to it, and it accordingly ordered that in default of payment of £440 arrears of maintenance the defendant Posner should be imprisoned for six months, the money to be paid in instalments of £150 forthwith and £2 5s. per week. The defendant took proceedings by way of order to review. Gavan Duffy J. held that the Western-Australian order was a nullity but that nevertheless it was enforceable in Victoria by reason of the provisions of the Maintenance Acts. Posner now appeals to this Court from the order of the Supreme Court discharging the order nisi to review and affirming the decision of the magistrate.""

31Starke J said at 476:
""A party, however, executing the process of an inferior court in a matter beyond its jurisdiction is liable to action and cannot justify under such process whether he knows the defect or not but the magistrate is only liable if he knew of the defect of jurisdiction (Calder v. Halket [(1840) 3 Moo PC 28 at 78; 13 ER 12 at 36]; Houlden v. Smith [(1850) 14 QB 841; 117 ER 323]; Mayor etc. of London v. Cox [(1867) LR 2 HL 239 at 263]). And an officer executing and obeying such process is protected (ibid).""

32The references by Starke J are consistent with the principle, enunciated as to officers, being referable to the exercise of judicial acts.

33Further, in Posner, Dixon J said at 481-2:

""Another rule was expressed by Denman C.J. in Andrews v. Marris [(1841) 1 QB 3 at 16; 113 ER 1030 at 1036]. Speaking of one of the defendants, his Lordship said:-'He is the ministerial officer of the commissioners, bound to execute their warrants, and having no means whatever of ascertaining whether they issue upon valid judgments or are otherwise sustainable or not. There would therefore be something very unreasonable in the law if it placed him in the position of being punishable by the Court for disobedience, and at the same time suable by the party for obedience to the warrant. The law, however, is not so. His situation is exactly analogous to that of the sheriff in respect of process from a Superior Court; and it is the well known distinction between the cases of the party and of the sheriff or his officer, that the former, to justify his taking body or goods under process, must show the judgment in pleading, as well as the writ; but for the latter it is enough to show the writ only; Cotes v. Michill [(1682) 3 Lev. 20; 83 ER 555]; Moravia v. Sloper [(1737) Willes 30 at 34; 125 ER 1039 at 1041]. It was said, indeed, for the plaintiff, that these and the numerous other authorities which might be cited to the same effect all went upon the principle that the proceeding, however irregular, was the Act of the Court.' Thus a conviction or order might be inefficacious in favour of a party but might have some operation as against the other party in favour of officers etc.""

34The principle expressed by Denman CJ, and applied by Dixon J, was directed to an act of the court, that is the judicial act or proceeding, being the order of the court which the officer was bound to execute. 

35In such cases, the courts are protecting third parties such as court officers or garnishees from the consequences of an invalid order (not being limited to an order of a superior court). Implicit and explicit in them is the protection of the authority of judicial proceedings. Further, there is every reason to consider that an officer of a court should be protected by his actions in obedience to an order of the court of which he is either part or an officer. Orders directed to police or gaolers in the form of a court order, not issued in the course of judicial process, but having the true legal character of an executive warrant, which is wholly lacking authority, do not stand as necessarily bringing the same protection to those who obey them as might be thought appropriate to officers of the court itself, even in such circumstances. It is unnecessary to explore this possible distinction. An invalid warrant gives a policeman no protection from the consequences of invasion of common law rights of person or property; it is statute that protects him: Feather v Rogers and Carroll v Mijovich (1991) 25 NSWLR 441 at 446-447 and 457.

36In Hadkinson v Hadkinson [1952] P 285 at 288, Romer LJ (with whose judgment Somervell LJ agreed) said in the context of the disobedience of the appellant to an order of the divorce court about not removing the child of the marriage from the jurisdiction:

""It is the plain and unqualified obligation of every person against, or in respect of whom, an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction, to obey it unless and until that order is discharged. The uncompromising nature of this obligation is shown by the fact that it extends even to cases where the person affected by an order believes it to be irregular or even void. 'A party who knows of an order, whether null and void, regular or irregular, cannot be permitted to disobey it. ... It would be most dangerous to hold that the suitors, or their solicitors, could themselves judge whether an order was null and void-whether it was regular or irregular. That they should come to the court and not take upon themselves to determine such a question: that the course of a party knowing of an order which was null and irregular and who might be affected by it was plain. He should apply to the court that it might be discharged. As long as it existed it must not be disobeyed.' (Per Lord Cottenham L.C. in Chuck v. Cremer.)"" (citations omitted)

37It is unnecessary to explore the validity, for all purposes, of this expression of the matter, in particular in respect of orders of inferior courts that lack jurisdiction or authority. The validity of his Lordship's expression of the matter as to orders of superior courts of record may be readily accepted. The report does not make clear whether the original order was of a superior court. Of course, it would have been had it been made by the then Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice. There is, however, implicit in the expression of the matter by Romer LJ, the judicial character of the order. The kind of constitutional circumstances and considerations relevant here are unlikely to arise in England and certainly were not present in the case before the Court of Appeal in Hadkinson.

38In Sirros v Moore [1975] QB 118 police officers obeyed an oral order of a Crown Court judge and took into custody an alien after he had left court on the dismissal of his appeal from an order of a magistrate recommending deportation. The alien sued the judge and the police officers. The judge was held to have immunity. The police carrying out orders directed to them by the judge were likewise protected. Lord Denning at 137 relied on London Corporation v Cox. No reasons were given other than reference to Cox. The Constables Protection Act 1750 was also available. Buckley LJ at 144 found the actions of following the instructions of the judge justifiable without expressing any reasons. The position of the police in Sirros can be equated with that of officers of the court. They were acting under the immediate orders of a judicial officer after the exercise of judicial process.

39The passage of Romer LJ in Hadkinson was cited with approval by Lord Diplock in Isaacs v Robertson [1985] AC 97 at 101-2, but in a context where the Privy Council was dealing with the orders of a superior court, a court of ""unlimited jurisdiction"" (at 101). It was also cited with approval by Simon Brown LJ (with whom Scott Baker and Latham JJ agreed) in R v Oldham Justices; Ex parte Cawley [1997] QB 1 at 15-16.

40The Full Court of the Western Australian Supreme Court, in Robertson (1997) 92 A Crim R 115, in reasons delivered in substance by Steytler J (with which Malcolm CJ and Franklyn J agreed) dealt with an appeal against the dismissal of a claim for false imprisonment against the State of Western Australia by a person who had been sentenced to fines and costs for certain offences and, in lieu of payment, imprisonment. In court, the magistrate pronounced that the two periods of imprisonment of 40 and 43 days were ""to be cumulative"". The person had also been sentenced to four years gaol for other offences. The person's solicitor advised him that he need not pay the fines since his prison terms for non-payment, though cumulative as between themselves, would be concurrent with the four year sentence. This was in fact the true intention of the sentence, as found by the trial judge, a proposition not contested on appeal. After a successful appeal against the severity of the four year sentence, the person was kept in custody for a period of days relative to the sentences in default of payment of the fines, and cumulative upon the non-parole period set by the appeal court in respect of the more serious matter. Each of the warrants that had been signed by the sentencing magistrate stated that the periods of detention in default of payment were cumulative, not only upon each other, but also ""on any other sentence or sentences which the offender may be undergoing"". This went beyond the sentence imposed (as found by the trial judge). Obviously, no error appeared on the face of the warrant to alert the gaoler to the error that had been made by the magistrate. At 122-125 Steytler J reviewed the authorities in connection with a person in the position of a gaoler following the direction contained in a warrant apparently valid on its face. He said:

""It would be an odd result, in a case in which a prison officer was simply enforcing a magistrate's order, if he or she were to be held liable because of the invalidity of the order when the person issuing the order was not so liable, at least in circumstances in which the order was valid on its face.

The courts have generally set their face against this kind of result.

...

[I]t seems to me to be difficult to deny the proposition, when regard is had for existing authority and for legislation in this State, that a prison superintendent may not be held liable for acting on a warrant which is, on the face of it, valid but which later turns out to have been wrongly issued for reasons which had not been known to that superintendent.

...

There is, in this State, no legislative provision which denies the application of the principle to prison superintendents. Indeed, those provisions of the Justices Act to which we were referred in the course of argument tend to support the efficacy of a warrant until set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction. Thus, s 23 of that Act provides that every act done or purporting to have been done by or before a Justice shall be taken to have been done within his jurisdiction without an allegation to that effect unless and until the contrary is shown. (See also ss 22, 36 and 37 of that Act.)

In the circumstances of this case, and in the light of the authorities to which I have referred, it seems to me that, if it be accepted that the warrant was unlawful and subject to being set aside, that did not render unlawful the conduct of the prison superintendent in acting upon the warrant. Rather, the warrant, being ex facie an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, was required to be obeyed by the prison authorities until discharged by a court of competent jurisdiction.

That being so there is no basis for any finding of liability on the part of the Superintendent of the prison in which the appellant was incarcerated.""

41Steytler J then distinguished Cowell v Corrective Services Commission of New South Wales (1988) 13 NSWLR 714 as a case concerning the wrongful calculation of remission entitlements.

42The principle that appears to be enunciated in Robertson can be taken as the following: that a prison officer enforcing a judicial order, valid on its face, but in fact legally invalid, of a judicial officer of a court of competent jurisdiction, acts lawfully in, and is not liable in tort for, complying with it. Implicit in the reasoning of Steytler J and in all the cases referred to by him is that the character of the order of the court is judicial. The Court in Robertson was not dealing with the issue of an executive warrant. True it is that the character of the order here as non-judicial was not apparent on the face of the order, which appeared to be judicial since it was made by the Court. That is no basis, however, for extending the principle enunciated by the Full Court of the Western Australian Supreme Court to an order, in form made by a court, which is in its true character a wholly invalid exercise of non judicial power of the kind described by the High Court in Kable. It was not argued that Robertson was plainly wrong. It can be accepted as dealing with judicial orders made by courts of competent jurisdiction. There is no call from its own terms to extend it to an ""order"" of the kind and character here. Thus the principle as above enunciated is to be understood as applicable to a judicial order in the sense discussed in Love. 

43Professors Aronson and Whitmore in Public Torts and Contracts (Law Book Company, 1982) doubt the correctness of Sirros v Moore, and doubt the existence of any generalised common law protective principle. Those learned authors, however, at page 152 recognise that there are cases that support the view that the common law's protection of a court officer acting on an apparently valid order or warrant was substantive and not just evidentiary: Higginson v Martin (1677) 2 Mod 195; 86 ER 1021; Olliet v Bessey (1679) Jones T 214; 84 ER 1223; Hill v Bateman (1726) 2 Strange 710; 93 ER 800; Moravia v Sloper (1737) Willes 30; 125 ER 1039; Morse v James (1738) Willes 122; 125 ER 1089; Painter v Liverpool Oil Gas Light Co (1836) 3 Ad & E 433;111 ER 478; Carratt v Morley (1841) 1 QB 18; 113 ER 1036; Thomas v Hudson (1847) 16 M & W 885; 153 ER 1450; Andrews v Marris (1841) 1 QB 3; 113 ER 1030; Demer v Cook (1903) 88 LT 629; Ward v Murphy (1937) 38 SR (NSW) 85 and Gerard v Hope [1965] Tas SR 15. To these cases can be added Henderson v Preston (1888) 21 QBD 362 (Court of Appeal consisting of Lord Esher MR, Lindley and Bowen LJJ) following Olliet v Bessey; and there can also be added the cases referred to by Willes J in Moravia v Sloper at 34-35; 1041-1042.

44All of these cases concerned the order or warrant issued by a court, implicitly being a judicial act in the course of, or after, judicial proceedings which the officer in his duties was bound to obey: see especially Willes J in Moravia v Sloper at 34-35; 1041-1042. In Painter v Liverpool Gas Co, Lord Denman CJ stated that officers were justified in executing a warrant because they were obliged not to canvass its validity and that Acts of Parliament had been passed for their protection. In Gerard v Hope, Crisp J perceived a restriction on the defence of a constable following an order of an inferior court to orders which the judicial officer had jurisdiction to make. In this respect, Crisp J referred to Morrell v Martin (1841) SC 4 Scott NR 300 at 306; also reported in 3 Man & G 581; 133 ER 1273, Andrew v Marris, Carratt v Morley and Burn's Justice of the Peace, 30th ed (1869), vol 1 at 1021. Certainly the judgment of Tindal CJ in Morrell v Martin supports that limitation. Tindal CJ (at 3 Man & G at 593-597; 133 ER at 1278-1279) said that the action of the justices of the peace in issuing the warrant outside their jurisdiction, as opposed to merely irregularly, was fatal to a plea of justification by the person to whom the warrant was directed. Tindal CJ identified the terms of the statute (the 1750 Act) as indicative of a matter to be dealt with by the Parliament and not (as Steytler J reasoned in Robertson at 125) indicative of the conformance of the common law to the statute.

45In Olliet v Bessey the Court of King's Bench did not appear so to limit the matter by reference to jurisdiction. Lord Esher in Henderson v Preston relied on Olliet and said at 366: 

""In the case of Olliet v. Bessey decided about 200 years ago, it was so held, and from that day to this no action can be found in the books to have been maintained against a gaoler where he acted within the terms of the warrant. That is sufficient to determine this case. Whether the plaintiff had any and, if so, what remedy, is a matter we need not inquire into: in any case this action will not lie. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed."" (citations omitted) 

46Lindley LJ at 366 referred to the fact that the person who issued the warrant had jurisdiction to do so in saying:

""All that one has to do is to read the warrant. What is a governor of a gaol who receives such a warrant to do except to obey it? It is perfectly valid and correct, and is authorized by the Act of Parliament, and issued by persons who have jurisdiction to issue it. It appears to me that the governor obeying that warrant has simply done his duty, and the warrant protects him and is an answer to the action.""

47In Demer v Cook Lord Alverstone CJ in the King's Bench Division found a gaoler liable for acting under an invalid warrant, but not the issuing court officer whose acts were only ministerial following the orders of the judicial officer.

48The existence of any such common law principle and its boundaries need not be finally decided upon to resolve this case. A number of matters are less than clear, including the place or influence of the 1750 Act as a suppressed premise, the influence of courts protecting their own processes and the extent to which this general rule applies to inferior courts acting without jurisdiction, and the meaning of jurisdiction in this context. For the purposes of the resolution of this appeal, I propose to proceed upon the assumption that the common law provides that, as a general rule, an officer (such as a sheriff or gaoler) obeying a judicial order of a competent court and executing it is protected, even if the order be at that time invalid. Such a rule, however, has never been held to be applicable, or expressed in such terms as require it to be held applicable, to an order whose invalidity is of the character, and for the reasons, found by the majority in Kable. The order here, according to the Court in Kable, is not a judicial order of a superior court of record. The order is not a judicial order at all, and it was made after a process which was the antithesis of judicial proceedings. 

49There is a statutory protection to the gaoler here: the Prisons Act, s 46. It was not argued that this was not applicable. No occasion arises to determine its applicability, as the gaoler was not sued. I will proceed on the assumption that it applies. The determination that the protection does not exist at common law, but does exist in a statutory provision is of the first importance to the liability of the State here. If the gaoler were protected by a principle of common law because he followed the instruction contained in an order of the Supreme Court, there would be no vicarious liability of the State. This follows from the terms of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW) (the ""Vicarious Liability Act""), ss 8(1) and 10 and the true nature of vicarious liability.

50The Vicarious Liability Act, ss 8 and 10 provide as follows:

""8(1) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the Crown is vicariously liable in respect of the tort committed by a person in the service of the Crown in the performance or purported performance by the person of a function (including an independent function) where the performance or purported performance of the function: 

(a) is in the course of the person's service with the Crown or is an incident of the person's service (whether or not it was a term of the person's appointment to the service of the Crown that the person perform the function), or
(b) is directed to or is incidental to the carrying on of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity of the Crown.

...

10(1) In this section: 

person includes the Crown.

statutory exemption means a provision made by or under an Act which excludes or limits the liability of a person.

(2) For the purposes of determining whether or not a person is vicariously liable in respect of a tort committed by another person, any statutory exemption conferred on that other person is to be disregarded.

(3) Except as provided by this section, nothing in this Act affects a statutory exemption conferred on a person.""

51A question of statutory construction arises as to the phrase ""in respect of the tort committed by a person"" in s 8(1). On one view of the theory of vicarious liability, the employer is liable ""not because the [employee] is liable, but because of what the [employee] has done"": Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Co v Long [1957] HCA 26; 97 CLR 36 at 61 (per Kitto J with whom Taylor J agreed at 66; emphasis added). Such a foundation for giving content to the phrase in s 8(1) might lead to the conclusion that the State is vicariously liable for the acts done, being imprisoning Mr Kable under colour of an order which was of an executive character and without statutory foundation or effect, even though the employee gaoler had a defence at common law of acting in obedience to an order by a judicial officer, apparently valid. This would bring into conformity the operation of ss 8 and 10 of the Vicarious Liability Act insofar as the latter excluded the effect or operation of statutory defences and the former by its own terms excluded the effect or operation of common law defences particular to the employee.

52The views of Kitto J (and Taylor J) have not prevailed. In Darling Island v Long, Fullagar J said at 57:

""The rule is, in my opinion, rightly stated, as it always is, in terms of liability and not in terms of duty. The liability is a true vicarious liability: that is to say, the master is liable not for a breach of a duty resting on him and broken by him but for a breach of duty resting on another and broken by another.""

53Subject to the proper place of Broom v Morgan [1953] 1 QB 597, as to which see Windeyer J in Parker v Commonwealth [1965] HCA 12; 112 CLR 295 at 300-301, the views of Fullagar J would appear to have prevailed: Cowell v Corrective Services Commission of NSW (1988) 13 NSWLR 714 at 731-32 (Clarke JA with whom Priestley JA agreed); Commonwealth v Connell (1986) 5 NSWLR 218 at 223 (Glass JA); De Bruyn v South Australia (1990) 54 SASR 231 at 235 (King CJ); and semble Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 44; 207 CLR 21 at [34] and Parker v Commonwealth at 301; and cf New South Wales v Ibbett [2006] HCA 57; 229 CLR 638 at [6] and [36].

54If the ""liability"" theory (as opposed to ""conduct"" theory) is accepted, as on the balance of authority it should be, there remains the need to deal with statutory exemptions or immunity from liability of torts otherwise committed. In the absence of a provision such as s 10, the existence of a particular statutory exemption or immunity in the employee, if it relieved the employee of liability, would on this hypothesis also relieve the Crown of vicarious liability: see Bell v Western Australia [2004] WASCA 205; 28 WAR 555. A legislative choice was made not so to relieve the State in these circumstances: s 10.

55This construction of s 8 as requiring the liability of the Crown employee (subject to the operation of a statutory exemption) before the State can be found vicariously liable accords with the interpretation of the Crown Proceedings Act 1972 (SA) in De Bruyn by King CJ at 235.

56Thus, if the gaoler is not liable because of a principle of the common law, the State is not liable vicariously. On the other hand, if the gaoler requires the statutory protection of a provision of a statute such as s 46 of the Prisons Act, the operation of the Vicarious Liability Act, s 10, will mean that the State is vicariously liable.

57Here, for the reasons already given, the order was not judicial in character. The order had no force or effect because, as an executive act, it took its force only from the statute which is and was always unconstitutional and of no effect. On the assumption, and to the extent, of a principle at common law as set out above, it does not extend to a non-judicial order not arising from judicial process. That said, at the time the order was delivered to the gaoler the unconstitutionality was not patent, since the order was unquestionably made by the Supreme Court, and apparently regularly, the constitutionality of the Act having been decided by a Supreme Court judge, later upheld in the Court of Appeal, in the undoubted exercise of judicial power under s 76(i) of the Constitution and s 39(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Those considerations go, however, to a decision to extend the assumed common law principle to a non-judicial order issued after non-judicial process.

58Any protected entitlement to act on and obey the order, if it exists at common law, is not compelled by the physical form of the order: Love. As an order arising from the purported exercise of invalid executive power antithetical to the judicial process and undermining of the Court's institutional place in the administration of justice under the Constitution, subject to one matter, there appears no reason, sourced in the constitutional considerations that led to invalidity, for extending protection at common law to a gaoler acting on the order in good faith, in circumstances where statutory protection exists. That one matter is an underlying policy consideration. The policy would rest on stability and confidence in the judicial system and in the orders issued by courts. It might be thought that, even in the circumstances attending the decision in Kable and the ""extraordinary"" legislation, the principle (in so far as it exists) should be extended to orders that were not judicial acts and were not the product of judicial process but of process that was antithetical to judicial process and judicial power, in order that confidence in orders issued by the Supreme Court not be undermined.

59Such extension of any such common law principle concerning protection to those who act in compliance with an order made by an apparently competent court must be driven by an evaluative choice or policy. 

60A refusal to extend the assumed common law principle may be seen as a vindication of a constitutional boundary or guaranteed right. Here, the vice of the CP Act was described by the majority of the High Court in uncompromising terms. The Act threatened basal concepts of governmental and constitutional organisation, in particular, the confidence in the judicial branch of government and the protection of the public under the rule of law. To put the matter thus reveals the vice of the statute in co-opting the Court for purposes inimical to its structure and integrity and to its constitutional function. To adapt the words of Kirby J in Residual Assco at 655 [64], citing C L Pannam, ""Unconstitutional Statutes and De Facto Officers"" (1966) 2 Fed L Rev 37 at 61-62:

""'[T]here may be situations in which public inconvenience and the frustration of legitimate reliance' on an apparent but unconstitutional law 'must give way to the retroactive invalidation of official acts in order to vindicate a constitutional boundary, or to guarantee a constitutional right'.""

61The relevant constitutional boundary or guarantee of a constitutional right here is that which was enunciated in Kable. Its importance had both public and private elements. It denied the orders of the Court their character as judicial acts and the character of their making as judicial process, since it was a process antithetical to the judicial process. This was in furtherance of the protection of the fundamental institutional character of the Supreme Court and of the administration of justice. It was also in furtherance of the protection of the fundamental common law right of Mr Kable not to be incarcerated (without an adjudication of criminal guilt, or otherwise than according to law) by the manifestation of the will of the Executive through the impermissible attempted use of the instrument of the Supreme Court. 

62In these circumstances, it might be thought appropriate to fashion the common law in such a way that accorded with the constitutional principles, not in a way that inverted them. A conclusion that the orders for detention here (characterised as non-judicial or executive in character and made after a process antithetical to the judicial process and issued without lawful statutory authority) provide a common law basis for protection (and thus to have a form of validity) must rest upon the judicial character of the institution making them. Yet this is the very institution constitutionally undermined by the invalid provisions for the making of the orders. Such an approach may be described as counter intuitive, and as inverting the operative constitutional principles. On the other hand, not to extend the assumed common law principle to provide protection to third parties who obey even these kinds of orders may be seen to undermine the authority of the Court, by casting doubt upon whether those to whom orders are directed should follow them. This might be seen to compound the harm done by the passing of the Act itself and acting under it. If s 46 applies in these circumstances, the gaoler has, however, adequate and effective statutory protection. 

63I can see the reasons, conformable with maintaining confidence in orders of the courts, for extending the operation of the assumed common law rule even to circumstances that involve extraordinary legislation such as the CP Act and the vices therein contained, and for extending the common law protection of persons such as the gaoler who act on the invalid non-judicial orders made under such legislation, as long as, in form, they are issued in the name of a court. The countervailing considerations are, however, far more powerful, in my view. This was not a judicial order. It was not made after judicial process. To extend the assumed common law principle to protect those who deprive the liberty of persons under such orders would be to fashion the common law to give efficacy to the unconstitutional attempted exercise of will of the executive, to deprive a subject of his liberty, in circumstances where the officer, who acted bona fide, is already protected by statute. I would not be willing to extend the assumed common law principle in this way. Further, if I am correct in my view that the assumed common law principle does not extend so far as to cover the present circumstances, it might be thought that it is for the High Court to take that step, given the deep involvement of constitutional principle and the operation of the integrated legal system in the Commonwealth. It is therefore unnecessary to consider finally the existence and reach otherwise of any such common law principle.

64It is unnecessary in these circumstances to consider whether the State could be liable for false imprisonment otherwise than vicariously through the liability of the gaoler (ignoring, as one must, the Prisons Act, s 46, for the position of the State). The argument did not proceed along these lines. Also, the question may involve Constitutional conceptions that may not have been covered by the notices issued under the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 78B. 

65Section 28 of the CP Act sought to protect the State against the consequences of steps taken under the Act. In Kable, Toohey J at 99 found ""the Act"" invalid. Gaudron J at 108 found s 5(1) invalid, as well as ""the remaining provisions of the Act which serve no purpose other than to carry s 5(1) into effect"". McHugh J at 124 found ""the Act ... invalid"". Gummow J at 144 made specific reference to s 28 and said it fell along with all other relevant provisions. 

66For these reasons, the claim in false imprisonment should not have been dismissed.

67BASTEN JA: From February to August 1995 the appellant, Gregory Wayne Kable, was held in a New South Wales prison. The supposed justification for his detention was an order made by a judge of the Supreme Court on an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions under the Community Protection Act 1994 (NSW). That Act permitted a detention order to be made in respect of Mr Kable (and no one else) if a judge were satisfied that he was likely to commit a serious act of violence and it was appropriate to hold him in custody.

(1) Issues
68Mr Kable challenged the constitutional validity of the legislation. He was successful in the High Court: Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51. Judgment was delivered on 9 September 1996, more than a year after the expiration of the first detention order made by Levine J, the Supreme Court (Grove J) having refused to make a further order. The present proceedings involve claims for damages arising from the conduct of the State and its officers in bringing proceedings against him and for detaining him for a period of six months, solely on the basis of the detention order made under the invalid Act. 

69The present proceedings were commenced promptly in 1996. They have, however, had a somewhat fraught procedural history. A trial commenced on 9 November 2009 before Hoeben J with the identification of six questions which, it was agreed, his Honour should determine before taking any other steps in the trial. The answers to those questions led to a judgment for the defendant: Kable v State of New South Wales [2010] NSWSC 811; 203 A Crim R 66 (30 July 2010). 

70By the time of the hearing, the claim had been crystallized by reference to three causes of action, namely:

(i) abuse of process;
(ii) malicious prosecution, and
(iii) false imprisonment.

The primary judge held that there was no case to go to a jury in respect of any of the three causes of action. In the result, no jury was empanelled and judgment was given in favour of the State of New South Wales. On 1 November 2010 Mr Kable appealed against the orders of Hoeben J, as of right, although out of time.

71For reasons given below, the claims in respect of abuse of process and malicious prosecution were properly struck out. On the other hand, the claim in respect of false imprisonment was maintainable and accordingly the orders made by the primary judge must be set aside.

72Procedural difficulties continued to haunt the proceedings in this Court. The primary judge rejected the claim of false imprisonment because, at the time of the appellant's detention, there was in place an order of a superior court which, according to its terms, warranted and required his detention. In the course of the appellant's argument, on the first day of the hearing of the appeal, it became apparent that the appellant sought to overcome that obstacle by relying upon the reason for the invalidity of the legislation which supported the order, namely that the Community Protection Act sought to confer on the Supreme Court a jurisdiction which was incompatible with the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth and was thus inconsistent with the terms of Chapter III of the Constitution. Whether that circumstance meant that, contrary to general law principles, the purported order could not in its terms provide a justification for the detention of the appellant, or that the setting aside of the order removed, retrospectively, any justification which otherwise existed, was a matter arising under, or involving the interpretation of, the Constitution. Alternatively, it could be seen to raise an issue as to the effect of the orders made by the High Court, setting aside the detention order and dismissing the Director's application, which in turn involved the effect of relief arising under the Constitution. Accordingly, although the step had not been taken at trial or prior to the hearing on appeal, the Court required that notices addressing these contentions be issued under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) to the various Attorneys General. The matter was adjourned to permit that step to be taken and to allow a reasonable time for the Attorneys to respond.

73One further procedural step requires explanation. This Court was originally constituted as a five judge bench because it was understood that there might be a challenge to aspects of the judgments of the Court in Leerdam v Noori [2009] NSWCA 90; 255 ALR 553, which held that a claim in tort for abuse of process could not lie against a person who was not a party to proceedings: Spigelman CJ at [29]-[44], Allsop P agreeing at [65] and Macfarlan JA agreeing at [125]-[126]. The present proceedings were originally commenced against the Director of Public Prosecutions (who was the moving party for the detention order) and the State. The Director was removed on the understanding that the State would bear responsibility for any liability of the Director. However, the appellant sought to impose liability directly on the State, possibly because there was no factual basis for asserting an improper purpose on the part of the Director. In the event, it has proved unnecessary to reconsider this aspect of Leerdam and, by implication, the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Emanuele v Hedley (1998) 179 FCR 290 (Wilcox, Miles and R D Nicholson JJ) on which Spigelman CJ relied at [32].

(2) Procedural history: causes of action and separate questions
74The circumstances which gave rise to these proceedings may be briefly summarised. On 5 September 1989 the appellant was arrested following the death by stabbing of his wife. Originally charged with murder, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility and, on 1 August 1990, was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 5 years and 4 months dating from 5 September 1989 and terminating on 4 January 1995. He was eligible for release on parole after serving 4 years, but parole was not granted. During the course of his imprisonment he wrote a number of threatening letters to persons whom he believed to be responsible for denying him access to his children. He was in fact charged with respect to the letters and was, for a period, held in custody in respect of those charges, bail having been refused. On 30 December 1994 Hunter J made a detention order under the Community Protection Act, but it had no effect because the appellant was not otherwise entitled to be released. When, on 23 February 1995, Levine J made a detention order under the Community Protection Act, he also granted the appellant bail in respect of the outstanding charges, to allow the impugned detention order to take effect. Accordingly, the period during which the appellant was detained under the invalid detention order commenced on 23 February 1995. (The outstanding charges were later permanently stayed.)

75The detention order was in the form of a document headed ""In the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Sydney Registry, Common Law Division"", in proceedings between the Director of Public Prosecutions and Mr Kable. The substance of the order was as follows:

""THE COURT ORDERS that:

1 Gregory Wayne Kable be detained in custody for a period of six months commencing 23 February 1995 and expiring 22 August 1995 pursuant to s.9 of the Community Protection Act 1994.

2 in the first instance the defendant to be taken back to the place from whence he came, namely the Remand Centre and be provided with the opportunity or necessary facility to remove any personal papers or effects.

THE COURT DIRECTS that:

3 the defendant be detained at the Special Care Centre of the Long Bay Correctional Prison.

THE COURT APPOINTS:

4 Dr Bruce Westmore, psychiatrist, as assessor for the Director of Public Prosecutions and Dr Jonathon Phillips as assessor for the defendant or such other person as may be agreed respectively by each party and formally appointed by the Court.

THE COURT NOTES that:

5 Exhibits are to be retained by the Court. Either party has leave to apply on three days notice.""

76There then followed the dates on which the order was made and entered (in each case being 23 February, 1994, which should have read 1995) over the printed name of Deputy Registrar Sourdin, with the imprint of the seal of the Court. 

77Despite the fact that the pleading has matured over some 15 years, it remains imprecise as to the basis of liability on the part of the State. Thus, the conduct in respect of which a claim for abuse of process is articulated is variously described as ""enacting"" or ""causing ... to be proclaimed"" the Community Protection Act: second further amended statement of claim, paragraphs 15 and 16. In relation to malicious prosecution, it is said that ""the proceedings and applications by the DPP ... were enabled, facilitated, promoted and encouraged"" by the State. In respect of unlawful imprisonment, the State is said to have falsely imprisoned the appellant, apparently through its actions by officers in the Department of Corrective Services, although that is not entirely clear: paragraphs 21-23. 

78At the outset of the hearing below, the State identified six questions to be answered, which were stated in the following terms:

""Malicious prosecution 

(i) Were the applications for orders pursuant to ss 5 and 7 of the Community Protection Act 1994 (CPA) 'Proceedings of the kind to which the tort of malicious prosecution applies?'

(ii) Given the plaintiff's concession that he does not assert actual ill will or spite on the part of any individual person, is there evidence capable of supporting a finding of 'institutional malice' sufficient in law to satisfy the third element of the tort of malicious prosecution, such that malice is to be determined by the jury? Alternatively, is there evidence of 'institutional malice' such that a jury would be directed to find malice satisfying the third element of the tort of malicious prosecution?

(iii) Has the plaintiff demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that the DPP or the State acted without reasonable and probable cause?

Collateral abuse of process

(iv) Has the plaintiff shown that 'the Executive Government and the Crown in the right of New South Wales were the plaintiff's prosecutor in enacting and promoting the proceedings'?

(v) Is there evidence capable of supporting a finding of an improper purpose by the State or the DPP, such that the question is to be determined by the jury? Alternatively, is there evidence of improper purpose by the State or the DPP such that a jury would be directed to find an improper purpose?

False imprisonment

(vi) Were the orders of Hunter J made on 30 December 1994 and Levine J made on 23 February 1995 nullities, or did they, prior to the decision of the High Court on 12 September 1996, constitute lawful justification for the detention of the plaintiff?""

79The orderly and usually necessary method of proceeding in a court or tribunal is to note the claim or cause of action (in civil proceedings) or the charge (in criminal proceedings), identify the several elements to be established by the moving party and then undertake a similar task in relation to any positive defences. However, with respect to the misuse of public power, that orderly approach is apt to breakdown. Where the responsible parties are all public officers or governmental entities, a mechanistic approach to the elements of the causes of action may well obscure underlying legal principles, which are stated in terms applicable to both private parties and public officials. 

80No reliance was placed on the concept of misfeasance in public office, but the allegations of malicious prosecution and collateral abuse of process, carried out by public officers, were no more than examples of misfeasance. Accordingly, one must approach with caution the six issues identified above. The formulation of these questions also left something to be desired. For example, question (ii) is particularly inapt; it involved unidentified assumptions of law which give rise to questions as to the adequacy of evidence, one being that there is a legally relevant concept of 'institutional malice'. In question (iv), the concept of 'enacting ... proceedings' was equally obscure. In the end, nothing turns on these infelicities of expression because the primary judge was satisfied as a matter of law that none of the causes of action could be made out: he did not attempt to give precise answers to the separate questions. 

81Nevertheless, in one respect, which arguably has proved critical, the formulation of the questions concealed the real issue. Question (vi) appeared to assume two possible conclusions as to the status of the detention orders: the first was that they were ""nullities"", in the sense that they were at all times invalid. The alternative was that, prior to being set aside by the High Court, they constituted lawful justification for the detention of the appellant. However, the assumption that the orders were not void but only voidable raised a further question, namely was the relevant time to inquire as to their status the time of the detention or the time the proceedings were brought? As will be seen, question (vi) was addressed by reference to the established principle that orders of a superior court are only ever voidable, even if made without jurisdiction. That is, they are sufficient to provide a lawful justification for the exercise of otherwise tortious power in their execution. There was at least a third possibility, which was the proposition for which the appellant primarily contended in this Court, namely that once set aside, the justification which they had otherwise provided was retrospectively removed so as to render the respondent (if not the individual gaoler) liable for unlawful imprisonment. That question ultimately lies at the heart of these proceedings.

82It is convenient to deal with the three causes of action in the order in which they were addressed by the primary judge: that is to commence with the claim for malicious prosecution, then the claim for collateral abuse of process, followed by unlawful imprisonment. Before turning to those matters, it is helpful to set out relevant aspects of the statutory regime operating at the time the cause of action arose.

(3) Statutory regime
(a) Community Protection Act
83The impugned detention order was made under the Community Protection Act, which commenced on 9 December 1994. In its first emanation as a bill, the object of the legislation was identified in the following terms:

""Object of Act

3. (1) The object of this Act is to protect the community by providing for the preventative detention (by order of the Supreme Court made on the application of the Attorney General) of persons who are, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, more likely than not to commit serious acts of violence.""

84The phrase ""serious acts of violence"" was defined by reference to identified provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW): s 4.

85The bill was amended in its course through Parliament so that, when enacted, s 3 provided as follows:

""Objects and application of Act

3. (1) The object of this Act is to protect the community by providing for the preventive detention (by order of the Supreme Court made on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions) of Gregory Wayne Kable.
...

(3) This Act authorises the making of a detention order against Gregory Wayne Kable and does not authorise the making of a detention against any other person.""

86The operative provision of the Act was in the following terms:

""Preventive detention orders

5. (1) On an application made in accordance with this Act, the Court may order that a specified person be detained in prison for a specified period if it is satisfied, on reasonable grounds:

(a) that the person is more likely than not to commit a serious act of violence; and
(b) that it is appropriate, for the protection of a particular person or persons or the community generally, that the person be held in custody.

(2) The maximum period to be specified in an order under this section is 6 months.""

87The ""Court"" was defined to mean the Supreme Court of New South Wales: s 4. The proceedings were described as ""civil proceedings"": s 14. The Court was required to be satisfied, consistently with the nature of the proceedings, on the balance of probabilities: s 15. The following further provisions were significant:

""Detention orders sufficient authority for detainees to be held in custody

19. A detention order is sufficient authority for the person against whom it is made to be held in custody in accordance with the terms of the order.
...

Detainees taken to be prisoners for certain purposes

22. (1) A detainee is taken to be a prisoner within the meaning of the Prisons Act 1952.
...

Discharge of detainees from prison

23. (1) A detainee must be discharged from prison at the expiry of the detention order to which the detainee is subject unless there is lawful reason for continuing to hold the detainee in custody.

(2) A detainee must not be discharged from prison, or allowed leave of absence from prison, otherwise than:

(a) at the expiry of the detention order to which the detainee is subject; or

Functions of Director of Public Prosecutions

31. (1) The Director or Public Prosecutions has the powers, authorities duties and functions conferred or imposed on the Director of Public Prosecutions by this Act.""

(b) Vicarious Liability Act
88To the extent that the liability of the State is said to be vicarious, an issue which arises at least in respect of the unlawful imprisonment claim, it is necessary to refer to the terms of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW) (""the Vicarious Liability Act"") which provides (including immaterial amendments since 1995):

""7 Vicarious liability of masters

Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a master is vicariously liable in respect of a tort committed by the master's servant in the performance or purported performance by the servant of an independent function where the performance or purported performance of the function: 

(a) is in the course of the servant's service for his or her master or is an incident of the servant's service (whether or not it was a term of his or her contract of service that the servant perform the function), or
(b) is directed to or is incidental to the carrying on of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity of the servant's master.

8 Further vicarious liability of the Crown

(1) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the Crown is vicariously liable in respect of the tort committed by a person in the service of the Crown in the performance or purported performance by the person of a function (including an independent function) where the performance or purported performance of the function:

(a) is in the course of the person's service with the Crown or is an incident of the person's service (whether or not it was a term of the person's appointment to the service of the Crown that the person perform the function), or
(b) is directed to or is incidental to the carrying on of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity of the Crown.""

89Section 5(1) stated that a person ""in the service of the Crown"" does not include a servant of the Crown and the phrase ""independent function"" is defined:

""independent function, in relation to a servant or a person in the service of the Crown, means a function conferred or imposed upon the servant or person, whether or not as the holder of an office, by the common law or statute independently of the will of the servant's master or the Crown, as the case may require.""

90It does not matter whether a gaoler was, to use the language of the Act already archaic in 1983, either a servant of the Crown or a person in the service of the Crown: cf Enever v The King [1906] HCA 3; 3 CLR 969. More importantly, s 10, which was replaced after the decision of this Court in Cowell v Corrective Services Commission (NSW) (1988) 13 NSWLR 714, rendered the operation of statutory protective provisions irrelevant for the purposes of the State's liability.

""10 Effect of statutory exemptions

(1) In this section: 

person includes the Crown.
statutory exemption means a provision made by or under an Act which excludes or limits the liability of a person.

(2) For the purposes of determining whether or not a person is vicariously liable in respect of a tort committed by another person, any statutory exemption conferred on that other person is to be disregarded.

(3) Except as provided by this section, nothing in this Act affects a statutory exemption conferred on a person.""

91Putting to one side the question of liability for the commencement of proceedings by the Director in the Supreme Court, it is clear that a vicarious liability on the part of the State for the detention of the appellant may arise from the provisions of the Vicarious Liability Act. The person directly responsible for the custody of the appellant will depend upon the operation of the Prisons Act 1952 (NSW) at the relevant time, if effect were given to s 22 of the Community Protection Act. 

(c) Prisons legislation
92The terms of the order made by the Supreme Court on 23 February 1995 are set out above: for present purposes it is sufficient to note that the order directed that the appellant ""be detained at the Special Care Centre of the Long Bay Correctional Prison"".

93The source of that language was not explored in the evidence, but because, pursuant to the Community Protection Act, s 22(1), a detainee was taken to be ""a prisoner within the meaning of the Prisons Act 1952"", it may be assumed that the place of confinement was a prison, within the meaning of that term in the Prisons Act. The Prisons Act deemed institutions named in Schedule 2 of the Act to be ""prisons under this Act"": s 3(4). The first institution so named was ""the State Penitentiary at Malabar"", which, the Court is entitled to note, is a complex of prisons located at Long Bay also referred to as Malabar. It should be accepted that the place of detention was part of the State Penitentiary at Malabar.

94At the relevant time (during 1995) the Prisons Act contained a number of provisions relating to the establishment and control of prisons and the custody of prisoners. The control of prisons generally was under the care of a Commissioner. Section 6 provided:

""Commissioner

6. (1) The Governor may appoint a Commissioner of Corrective Services.
(2) The Commissioner has, subject to the direction and control of the Minister, the functions conferred or imposed on the Commissioner by or under this or any other Act.
(3) The Commissioner has the care, direction, control and management of all prisons and prison complexes.

...""

95A number of further provisions, then found in Pt 8 of the Prisons Act, are also relevant to the question of responsibility for detention.

""Custody of prisoners

39. (1) Every prisoner shall whilst detained in a prison be deemed to be in the custody of the governor of the prison to which he has been committed or removed and the liability of the Sheriff or other person delivering such prisoner shall cease on delivery of such prisoner to the governor of the prison.

...

Responsibility of governors of prisons

40. Every governor of a prison shall have the charge and superintendence of the prison for which he is appointed and he shall be liable to answer for the escape of any prisoner from his custody whenever such escape shall happen by or through his neglect or default, but not otherwise.

Gaol delivery

40A. (1) The Commissioner shall, at the times prescribed by the regulations made under this Act, make returns in writing to the Supreme Court as to all persons detained in each prison, otherwise than in pursuance of a sentence, for more than 3 months....""

96The structure of the Prisons Act was not at all stages identical to its structure in 1995. (The Prisons Act later became the Correctional Centres Act 1952, which was repealed on 3 April 2000 by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 (NSW).) Thus, from 1975 to 1988 the role of the Commissioner of Corrective Services was undertaken by a statutory corporation, known as the Corrective Services Commission. It was that body which was extant at the time that the arrangements for custody of persons in prisons in New South Wales were considered in Cowell. The majority in that case (Clarke JA, Priestley JA agreeing) held that ""in the light of the [Commission's] lawful power to exercise control over the prisoner, both directly by order and by directions to a governor, it should be regarded as responsible for detaining the prisoner throughout the term of his sentence"": at 737D.

97Cowell also referred to the position of the Commissioner who, prior to 1978, had performed the functions of the Commission. The Court held that the Commissioner would have had immunity pursuant to the protective provision then found in s 46 of the Prisons Act. (The Commission itself did not have such immunity because the specific protective provision was construed to protect individuals and not the statutory corporation.) However, the Court noted at 737-738:

""Prior to 1978, the Commissioner would not, in accordance with established principle, have been liable for the tort of any inferior officer.... In the absence of a privative provision such as s 46, he could have been liable if he himself ordered or directed that an inferior officer perform a particular task, the performance of which had given rise to a claim for damages. But by virtue of s 46 he would, in the absence of malice and provided he had reasonable and probable cause for directing the performance or task, have been immune from action.""

98This obiter reasoning in Cowell is applicable to the position of the Commissioner, an office resurrected in 1992, in the present case. It is, therefore, appropriate to note the terms of s 46:

""Civil and criminal liability

46(1) No action or claim for damages shall lie against any person for or on account of anything done or commanded to be done by him and purporting to be done for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act, unless it is proved that such act was done or commanded to be done maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause.""

99The scope of that provision depended on whether the impugned conduct of the protected person was undertaken ""for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of"" that Act or for some other purpose such as carrying out a warrant issued pursuant to a court order: Cowell at 723 (McHugh JA). However, to the extent that the Commissioner was protected by s 46, it does not follow that the State was protected. The liability of the State could arise under either of ss 7 or 8 of the Vicarious Liability Act.

(4) Claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process
(a) element of intention
100The claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process each involved several elements which are contested in the present case. However, both may be disposed of by reference to the mental elements in respect of the tortfeasor. It is not in dispute that each requires ""malice"". That requirement gave rise to two related difficulties for the appellant. First, it required deliberate or conscious wrongdoing of some kind; secondly, it required an individual state of mind. The appellant did not seek to establish the former, nor in any specific sense, the latter. 

101The appellant sought to sidestep both these difficulties by relying on a concept labelled ""institutional malice"". That, it was contended, avoided the need to identify personal ill-will on the part of any individual. For a government deliberately to cause harm to a citizen by a course of conduct which was fundamentally unconstitutional, in the sense of being an affront to the rule of law, warranted a remedy. In such circumstances, the appellant submitted, general law concepts, including the mental element of the torts relied on, must be adapted to the circumstances of the case. 

102It is, however, not open to this Court to accept that contention. To explain why that is so, it is necessary to address aspects of tort law in the context of public law more generally. 

103Neither malicious prosecution nor abuse of process are purely public law torts; each may be committed by an individual with no public position or function. For example, a person who makes a false complaint of criminal assault may be liable for malicious prosecution, although it is a police informant who commences the prosecution. However, like other general law torts, the elements are the same when the alleged tortfeasor is a public official. By way of contrast, there is only one civil cause of action for damages which operates purely in the area of public law, namely misfeasance in public office: Pyrenees Shire Council v Day [1988] HCA 3; 192 CLR 330 at [124], Gummow J, referring to Sadler, ""Liability for Misfeasance in a Public Office"", (1992) 14 Syd L Rev 137 at 138. Misfeasance also requires malice in the sense of deliberately unlawful conduct, or at least conduct as to the lawfulness of which the official is reckless. Causing harm by acting beyond the limits of power, even if negligent as to those limits, does not create a liability to pay compensation on the part of the official or the government: see M Aronson, ""Misfeasance in Public Office: A Very Peculiar Tort"", (2011) 35 Melb UL Rev 1 at 9-15. That is not to say that a public authority may not be liable for negligence (a tort of general application), but only that carelessness as to the limits of power is not in itself tortious.

104It follows that, as with the constitutional challenge to the validity of the Community Protection Act, the motives and intentions of relevant Ministers or individual members of the Parliament, not being relevant to the effect of the legislation, cannot give rise to any tortious liability on the part of the State: cf HA Bachrach Pty Ltd v State of Queensland [1998] HCA 54; 195 CLR 547 at [11]-[12], albeit comments made in the course of considering the validity of legislation, rather than tortious liability.

(b) malicious prosecution
105It is generally considered that the tort of malicious prosecution has four elements. First, the conduct complained of must involve a criminal prosecution and, secondly, the proceedings must have terminated unsuccessfully for the prosecution. The third element requires that the defendant, in initiating or maintaining the proceedings acted maliciously and, fourthly, acted without reasonable and probable cause: A v State of New South Wales [2007] HCA 10; 230 CLR 500 at [1].

106There was an issue before the primary judge as to whether the first element of the tort was satisfied. According to the Community Protection Act, the proceedings were civil; nevertheless, they resulted in a detention order pursuant to which the appellant was imprisoned. The primary judge declined to decide this preliminary point against the appellant: at [45]. His Honour placed reliance on the opinion of Lord Steyn in Gregory v Portsmouth City Council [2000] 1 AC 419 at 426, noting that ""[a] distinctive feature of the tort is that the defendant has abused the coercive powers of the state"". However, the issue before the House of Lords was whether the tort extended to disciplinary proceedings undertaken by a local authority: their Lordships held it did not. To adopt such an imprecise criterion as abusing the coercive powers of the state as sufficient to engage the tort of malicious prosecution was not countenanced in Gregory, and does not find support in Australian case-law. Conventional civil proceedings no doubt engage the coercive power of the State, but their abuse does not constitute malicious prosecution. On the other hand, there were, in the present context, other features which justified Hoeben J declining to dismiss the claim on the basis that it did not satisfy the first element of the tort. As will be seen below, there is a separate tort of collateral abuse of process, which is ""quite distinct from that of malicious prosecution"": R P Balkin and J L R Davis, Law of Torts (4th ed, 2009) [25.23]; Dowling v Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1915] HCA 56; 20 CLR 509 at 521-522 (Isaacs J).

107The primary judge then sought to identify who initiated the proceedings. Under the Community Protection Act, the Director of Public Prosecutions was the only party entitled to seek a detention order against the appellant. However, his Honour noted that the appellant had sought to maintain a case against the Executive Government, and not against the Director. He held that the claim against the State, based on the various steps which it took to bring about the enactment of the legislative scheme, with the foreseeable and expected consequence that proceedings would be taken to obtain a detention order, revealed a misunderstanding of ""the separation of powers doctrine as it operates in the governance of New South Wales"": at [60]. His Honour held, at least implicitly, that the State could not be responsible for the actions of the Director because the Director was, by virtue of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW), ""independent of the Executive"": at [56]. No consideration was given to the possible liability of the State for a tort committed by the Director, pursuant to the Vicarious Liability Act.

108The primary judge treated those conclusions as sufficient to dispose of the claim for malicious prosecution: at [62]. However, he did proceed to consider the other elements of the tort. In relation to the second element, namely favourable termination, he accepted that the application made to Levine J did ultimately terminate in favour of the appellant: at [63]. The primary judge also addressed the third and fourth elements. It is convenient to deal together with the elements of malice and lack of reasonable and probable cause.

109As the judgment of six members of the Court in A v State of New South Wales noted, the requirement of malice involved an analysis of the purpose for which the proceedings were commenced or maintained. Their Honours explained at [55]:

""For immediate purposes it suffices to describe malice as acting for purposes other than a proper purpose of instituting criminal proceedings. Purposes other than a proper purpose include, but are not limited to, purposes of personal animus of the kind encompassed in ordinary parlance by the word 'malice'.""

110That element is, at least primarily, concerned with the motive of the prosecutor. The fourth and separate consideration, namely the absence of reasonable and probable cause, is directed to an objective assessment of whether the proceedings were instituted without sufficient grounds to justify that act.

111It is not necessary to indulge in any further sophistication of that analysis for present purposes. Putting to one side the claim as to the purpose of the Executive Government in promoting the legislative scheme ultimately accepted by Parliament, there was no basis for finding that the Director commenced the proceedings for any purpose other than that revealed by the legislation, nor that, applying the standards contained in the Community Protection Act, there were not reasonable grounds for seeking the order provided by the Act.

112The possibility that the Act exceeded the constitutional powers of the legislature could not of itself turn otherwise legitimate proceedings into a malicious prosecution. It could hardly have been contended that the invalidity was so patent that reliance upon it must have been improper: three judges in the Common Law Division and three members of this Court rejected the constitutional arguments as raised before them: see Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 36 NSWLR 374.

113Both before the primary judge and in this Court, the appellant's argument focused on a concept identified by his Honour as ""institutional malice"": at [66]. The appellant accepted that the legislative power of the State would have permitted an enactment identifying him and ordering his detention. (Presumably, the legislature could also have conferred power on an officer of the Executive to make an order of the kind made by the Court, in circumstances identified in the Community Protection Act; a course which would have better protected the appellant's human rights than a statute of ""pains and penalties"", though arguably not to the extent that a vesting of power in an independent judge would do.) The element of iniquity relied upon was the vesting of power in the Supreme Court to ""give a public veneer of impartiality"" to the process and any order made.

114This argument cannot be sustained. First, it is not open to a litigant to impugn the motives of the Parliament, either individually or collectively: Bill of Rights 1688 (Imp), art 9; O'Chee v Rowley (1997) 142 FLR 1 at 12-13 (McPherson JA); Street v Hearne [2007] NSWCA 113; 70 NSWLR 231 at [207] (Handley AJA). Secondly, where that which is done without power is a legislative act, to provide compensation for those who suffer from a purported, but unconstitutional, legislative act is to confer a right to compensation based on unconstitutionality, in the absence of any common law tort. That is precisely what was rejected by Dixon J in James v The Commonwealth [1939] HCA 9; 62 CLR 339 at 362, a proposition which has not been doubted by the High Court.

(c) collateral abuse of process
115That which is sufficient to constitute a tort of collateral abuse of process is by no means amenable to precise expression. It is often explained by reference to that which it is not. Thus, in Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34; 174 CLR 509 the tort was discussed by Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ by reference to its relationship with the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to stay proceedings which were abusive: at 522-526. The case itself was concerned with the exercise of the judicial power to control proceedings, not the tort. Their Honours discussed the scope of the tort by contrasting it with malicious prosecution at 522-523:

""The tort of collateral abuse of process differs from the older action for malicious prosecution in that the plaintiff who sues for abuse of process need not show: (a) that the initial proceeding has terminated in his or her favour; and (b) want of reasonable and probable cause for institution of the initial proceeding.""

116It might be added that the abusive proceedings need not be criminal in nature. Accordingly, the only element of the four identified in respect of malicious prosecution required for abuse of process is ""malice"" in the sense of an improper purpose. There is a further difference: an action for malicious prosecution may be brought against a person who takes steps to initiate proceedings even if that person is not the informant: by contrast, in relation to collateral abuse of process, it has been held that the defendant must be the party who actually instituted the proceedings: Emanuele v Hedley (see [73] above) at [44], relying on three passages in the joint judgment in Williams v Spautz, at 523, 524 and 526. Whether or not such a principle can be derived from the discussion in Spautz at those pages, it has been affirmed by this Court in Leerdam (see [73] above), particularly in the judgment of Spigelman CJ at [32]-[44], Allsop P and Macfarlan JA agreeing at [65] and [126] respectively. It is not necessary to deal with the appellant's challenge to the correctness of that view.

117It is also not necessary to explore the ill-defined parameters of the concept of ""improper purpose"" in the context of this tort. There was no evidence that the Director, or any Minister or senior officer of the government who might have been in a position to influence the Director, had any purpose in respect of the institution or maintenance of the proceedings in the Supreme Court, other than to achieve that for which the Community Protection Act expressly provided. Accordingly, it was necessary for the appellant to contend that that purpose was improper because the Act itself was unconstitutional and thus provided no basis for such proceedings. However, this argument is unsustainable for the reasons given above in respect of the same argument in relation to malicious prosecution.

(5) Unlawful imprisonment
(a) pleadings
118The third cause of action relied upon by the appellant involved a trespass to the person, in the form of unlawful imprisonment. The allegation against the State that it falsely imprisoned him, ""by itself and/or by its servants or agents"", comprehended claims of direct liability and vicarious liability: further amended statement of claim, par 22. The particulars of the claim asserted that the appellant was detained and incarcerated by ""Prison officers of the Department of Corrective Services"" in one of the Long Bay gaols. For present purposes, it may be assumed that that language would be apt to include the governor of the relevant gaol and the Commissioner of Corrective Services.

119In its defence, the State pleaded that the applicant was detained in prison pursuant to an order ""purportedly pursuant to section 5 of the purported Act"": defence, par 8(b) and (c). The State further pleaded that the order ""appeared on [its] face to be both within jurisdiction and without legal error"" and that ""no servants or agents of the [State] executing the orders ... falsely imprisoned the plaintiff and the [State] accordingly did not falsely imprison the plaintiff"": par 8(e). The defence did not admit so much of the claim as asserted that the State was itself responsible for the detention and denied that the State was liable in circumstances where its officers did not commit the tort. 

120The appellant also claimed that the State was responsible for his false imprisonment as a result of the chain of events following the introduction of the Community Protection Bill into the Parliament. It was said that the actions of the Executive in taking that step ""either directly and/or by reason of the natural and probable consequence of those actions, brought about the wrongful imprisonment"" of the appellant: par 23A(h). The State denied those allegations, but they are unnecessary for the cause of action. As stated by Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough in R v Governor of Brockhill Prison; Ex parte Evans (No 2) [2001] 2 AC 19 at 42F:

""Imprisonment involves the infringement of a legally protected right and therefore must be justified. If it cannot be lawfully justified, it is no defence for the defendant to say that he believed that he could justify it. In contrast with the tort of misfeasance in public office, bad faith is not an ingredient of the tort; it is not a defence for the defendant to say that he acted in good faith ...""

121The pleadings did little to clarify the legal basis of the State's defence to conduct which, absent lawful justification, would constitute unlawful imprisonment. Question (vi) proposed a dichotomy: either the order of Levine J made on 23 February 1995 was a nullity or, prior to being set aside, it constituted lawful justification for the detention of the appellant. The question identified more precisely the position taken by the State in these proceedings, but did not sufficiently reflect the appellant's response that the invalid order, not being an exercise of judicial power, provided no justification for the imprisonment.

122The liability of the State for the alleged tort of unlawful imprisonment must be considered by reference to the following issues:

(a) was the appellant deprived of his liberty without consent;
(b) was the deprivation carried out by -
(i) the State itself, or
(ii)a person for whose conduct the State was liable;
(c) was the deprivation of liberty justified by law?

123The answer to the first question was not contested: the appellant was deprived of his liberty without his consent. The answer to the second question received inadequate consideration in the Court below, probably because it was thought that the answer to the third question pre-empted any need to consider the source of potential liability. For reasons which will be explained below, that approach may have obscured an important issue in the proceedings.

(b) findings at trial
124In respect of direct liability, the primary judge held at [98]:

""There is no authority for the proposition that the Executive is to be held directly responsible where a person is wrongfully imprisoned after a hearing before a court pursuant to a law enacted by it.""

125It followed, his Honour held, that the State could only be liable for the plaintiff's wrongful imprisonment if liability were found ""against the Corrective Services Commission and its servants responsible for his detention and for whose actions the defendant is liable"": at [99].

126Reference to the Corrective Services Commission appears to have arisen from the reliance of the appellant on the judgment of this Court in Cowell. In that case, proceedings were taken against the Commission and the State for wrongful imprisonment in circumstances where the claimant had been detained beyond the termination of his sentence, properly calculated. Clarke JA (Priestley JA agreeing) held that a prisoner was, at that time, in the ""joint custody"" of the Commission and the governor of the gaol in which he was incarcerated: at 737. The assumption in the judgment below that the Commission employed custodial officers was probably wrong, but in any event irrelevant: the Commission had, some years before the incarceration of the appellant (in 1995), been abolished by the Prisons (Amendment) Act 1988 (NSW). 

127The primary judge appears to have assumed initially that the State was liable ""for the actions"" of its officers, whether or not the officers were personally liable: at [98]-[99]. However, he later stated the question as being whether the setting aside of the court order by the High Court gave the appellant a cause of action for wrongful imprisonment against the gaolers: at [100]. The distinction was potentially important: see Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Co Ltd v Long [1957] HCA 26; 97 CLR 36. However, the Court's attention was apparently not drawn to the Vicarious Liability Act which rendered the Crown vicariously liable in respect of a tort committed by a person ""in the service of the Crown in the performance or purported performance by the person of a function (including an independent function)"": s 8(1). 

128Ultimately the appellant failed below because the order of Levine J was made in the purported exercise of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as a superior court of record, the orders of which were valid and effective until set aside. The order in the present case was not set aside until after the period of imprisonment had expired and the order therefore provided the lawful justification for the conduct of the gaolers. The basis for the want of jurisdiction, namely the constitutional invalidity of the Community Protection Act, was irrelevant: at [101] and [110]. This conclusion was said to flow from the uncontested line of authority giving such effect to orders of superior courts, including orders made without jurisdiction, and the reasoning of the High Court in relation to constitutional invalidity in Re Macks; Ex parte Saint [2000] HCA 62; 204 CLR 158.

(c) appellant's contentions
129The appellant pleaded that the State was liable both directly and vicariously for his false imprisonment. For reasons which will be noted shortly, the claim in direct liability is not tenable. Accordingly, the question is whether the officers of the State responsible for the appellant's custody could rely, by way of lawful justification, on the invalid order made under the Community Protection Act.

130The appellant's challenge to the approach of the primary judge involved two steps. First, he contended that while a judicial order of a superior court might provide lawful justification for a State officer seeking to carry out its ostensible command, a non-judicial order provided no such protection. The second step in the reasoning was to characterise the order in the present case as non-judicial.

131If the order itself provides no protection from liability to the gaoler, the third step in the argument is to ask whether there is any statutory protection available to the gaoler. However, that question may not need to be resolved if, pursuant to the Vicarious Liability Act, the State will be liable regardless of any statutory protection the gaoler may enjoy from personal liability.

(d) liability of the State - direct or vicarious
132Although pleaded, little attention was paid to the possibility that the State might be held directly liable for false imprisonment. The absence of common law authority in this regard may flow, at least in part, from the immunity of the Crown from actions in tort, not effectively removed in the UK until 1948, with the enactment of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 (UK). Similar legislation had been passed earlier in New South Wales: Claims against Government Act 1857 (NSW). Further, the enactment of the Vicarious Liability Act may have again rendered it unimportant whether the State were being sued as directly liable, or merely as vicariously liable for the actions of its officers. However, the imposition of direct liability for breaches of a duty of care in circumstances where the principal has a special relationship with the injured party might be thought to operate a fortiori in circumstances where the principal has, unlawfully, created that relationship. That the Commonwealth owed non-delegable duties of care with respect to persons in immigration detention was discussed, on the basis of a concession, by Finn J in S v Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 549; 143 FCR 217 at [215]-[216]; see generally, S Kneebone, Tort Liability of Public Authorities (LBC, 1998) p 324ff.

133A different view appears to have been taken, however, in Haskins v The Commonwealth [2011] HCA 28; 244 CLR 22. It is convenient to note here the circumstances of that case, which has further significance in respect of vicarious liability. In Lane v Morrison [2009] HCA 29; 239 CLR 230, the High Court had held the legislation establishing an Australian military court, outside the command structure of the armed forces, to be an invalid exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. Following that decision, in 2009, the Parliament legislated to give effect to punishments and orders made under the invalid scheme. Mr Haskins had served a period of detention imposed by the invalid court and sued the Commonwealth for damages for false imprisonment. He challenged the 2009 legislation, in part on the basis that it sought to effect an acquisition of his action for false imprisonment without just terms: at [41]. To address that argument, it was necessary for the Court to consider whether he had such an action. The majority judgment (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) stated at [43]:

""The liability which the plaintiff seeks to attribute to the Commonwealth for what he alleges to be his false imprisonment must be vicarious liability. The Commonwealth would be vicariously liable for false imprisonment under ss 56 and 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) only if the plaintiff could succeed in that claim against the officer who detained him: the officer in charge of the Corrective Establishment.""

134Haskins was not considered by the primary judge, as it post-dated that judgment. It was given limited consideration in argument in this Court, although the appellant placed some reliance upon it. He did not, however, seek to distinguish the statement set out above. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court to proceed on the basis that the liability of the State can only be vicarious.

(e) the issue - legal nature of order
135A person convicted of an offence and imprisoned will not have an action for unlawful imprisonment merely because the conviction was later reversed and a judgment of acquittal substituted. As explained by Dixon J in Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan [1931] HCA 34; 46 CLR 73 at 106, in relation to a conviction for an offence under a regulation, later disallowed:

""Thus, after a regulation has been disallowed, no one is liable to conviction for an offence committed while it was in force. His liability ceases when the law is revoked that imposed it. But if he has already been convicted, then because his liability has merged in the conviction, it no longer depends upon the law under which it arose, and it does not lapse with the revocation of the law. The conviction has become the source of his liability for his offence, and the conviction continues in force because its operation does not depend upon the law creating the offence, but upon the authority belonging to a judgment or sentence of a competent Court.""

136Some consequences may be retrospectively undone, apparently where the conviction has affected the status of the individual. Thus, in Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Cavanough [1935] HCA 45; 53 CLR 220, the High Court held that a public official who, by statute, was deemed to have vacated his office upon conviction of a felony was, upon the conviction being set aside, entitled to be restored to his office and to recover unpaid salary. 

137The appellant did not rely on this approach. Rather, the appellant's case was that the detention order was not a judicial order like a conviction and did not carry the same consequences. 

138The State accepted that an act of the Executive which would constitute a trespass under the general law, absent lawful justification, will not be excused from liability by bona fide reliance upon a law which was later held to be unconstitutional: see, eg, Antill Ranger & Co Pty Ltd v Commissioner for Motor Transport [1955] HCA 25; 93 CLR 83; Deacon v Grimshaw (1955) 93 CLR 104 at 108 (Fullagar J); approved in Commissioner for Motor Transport v Antill Ranger & Co Pty Ltd (1956) 94 CLR 177 (PC); C L Pannam, ""Tortious Liability for Acts Performed Under an Unconstitutional Statute"" (1965-67) 5 Melb UL Rev 113 at 116-117; Coleman v Power [2004] HCA 39; 220 CLR 1 at [142]-[144] (McHugh J) (in dissent on the validity of the provision, dealing with the resulting arrest based upon the invalid law). As the Privy Council noted in Antill Ranger, although a constitutional prohibition confers no private right on an individual, ""it is a transparent misuse of this proposition to proceed to the further proposition that a trader, who but for the [impugned legislation] would have a right enforceable at common law, cannot plead that a defence raised under [the impugned legislation] is precluded by the [constitutional provision]"": 94 CLR at 181.

139The State sought to avoid this conclusion by relying on the principle that an order of a superior court has effect until set aside, sufficient to provide lawful justification for a deprivation of liberty. The State referred to numerous authorities for the proposition that an order of a superior court made in excess of jurisdiction is merely voidable and not void and therefore has effect until set aside: see Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5; 68 CLR 571; DMW v CGW [1982] HCA 73; 151 CLR 491; Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49; 192 CLR 69; Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27; 198 CLR 511 at [164]-[165] (Gummow and Hayne JJ); Re Macks and Matthews v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] FCA 288; 97 FCR 396 (upholding a finding of contempt in respect of an order made by the Federal Court in a jurisdiction invalidly cross-vested under a State law). However, as Hayne J stated in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11; 209 CLR 597 summarising the effect of those authorities at [151]:

""In general, judicial orders of superior courts of record are valid until they are set aside on appeal, even if they are made in excess of jurisdiction."" [Emphasis added.]

140The principle is not that an apparently valid order, made by a court in exercise of judicial power, must be treated as valid until set aside. That broad principle would require that a person be liable for contempt for failing to comply with an order of the District Court which was later set aside, a conclusion rejected in Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal [1999] HCA 19; 198 CLR 435 at [55] (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ). In reaching that conclusion their Honours accepted the reasoning in United Telecasters Sydney Ltd v Hardy (1991) 23 NSWLR 323 at 335 (Samuels AP, Clarke and Meagher JJA agreeing) applying the principle set out by McHugh JA in Attorney-General (NSW) v Mayas Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 342 at 357:

""If an inferior tribunal exercising judicial power has no authority to make an order of the kind in question, the failure to obey it cannot be a contempt. Such an order is a nullity. Any person may disregard it.""

141The principle depends on the order being made in the exercise of judicial power by a superior court. There was no doubt that the Supreme Court was a superior court; however that did not mean that all exercises of statutory power by its judges constituted judicial orders. Accordingly, the principal issue between the parties was whether the detention order made by Levine J was properly characterized as an order made in the exercise of judicial power or not. If not, it required a valid statutory power to give it legal effect and that was concededly missing. The legal quality of the order was thus central to the defence of lawful justification.

(f) whether order judicial or non-judicial
142The scope of judicial power can arguably be broader in State jurisdiction, where the doctrine of the separation of powers has a lesser operation than under the federal Constitution. However, no reliance was placed on that consideration, no doubt because before Levine J, as before other judges of the Common Law Division who had been invited to rule that the Community Protection Act was invalid, it was contended that the legislation offended the Commonwealth Constitution, although not precisely on the basis later accepted by the High Court. Those contentions involved a matter arising under the Constitution and involving its interpretation, within s 76(i) of the Constitution and notices were issued under the Judiciary Act, s 78B. In determining the matter, the Court was, therefore, exercising federal jurisdiction, which it was entitled to do pursuant to the Judiciary Act, s 39(2). Levine J dismissed the arguments, following, as a matter of comity, the views of earlier single judges of the Court, but that did not affect the nature of the jurisdiction being exercised. In consequence and according to established principle, the whole of the proceedings in the Common Law Division involved an exercise of federal jurisdiction.

143That being so, the effect of the Court's order was, the State submitted, indistinguishable from the effect of orders of the Federal Court, made in exercise of a jurisdiction purportedly conferred on the Court by State legislation and discussed in Re Macks. Orders of a superior court, even when made without jurisdiction, were held to be valid and effective until set aside, either by way of appeal or the exercise of constitutional judicial review under s 75(v) of the Constitution.

144The operative principle is that the contingent effect given to a judicial order of a superior court is an incident of the exercise of judicial power. A superior court is one which has jurisdiction to determine the scope and extent of its own jurisdiction, albeit subject to appeal and, if a court of limited jurisdiction, as all courts in Australia are at least since the commencement of s 38 of the Judiciary Act, the supervisory jurisdiction: DMW v CGW at 509-510 (Dawson J); Re McJannet; Ex parte Minister for Employment, Training and Industrial Relations (Qld) [1995] HCA 31; 184 CLR 620 at 653 (Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ); Re Macks at [140] (McHugh J).

145This principle appears to give rise to a logical conundrum. To the extent that the limit on the jurisdiction of a particular court is imposed by the Constitution, how can the law on which the effect of the judicial order depends give it an effect extending beyond the constitutional limits of that jurisdiction? Of course, if a parliament has legislative power with respect to the subject matter of the order, it may be able by legislation to give effect to an order which was an invalid exercise of judicial power: Re Macks concerned an exercise of such a power. The conundrum arises where the effect of the court's order depends upon the scope of the legislation conferring jurisdiction on the court. Referring to the relevant constitutional provisions, McHugh J stated in Re Macks at [143]:

""Section 71 gives the Parliament power to create federal courts. But given the limitations imposed by ss 75 and 76, it is impossible to conclude that the power to create those courts enables the Parliament to declare that the orders of those courts, made without constitutional authority, are binding until set aside. Just as the Parliament cannot extend the scope of its powers by making regulations binding until set aside or quashed, it cannot extend the scope of its powers - even for a moment - by giving the federal courts power to make binding orders that go beyond the constitutional authority of the Parliament.""

146In Re Macks McHugh J was alone in expressing that view, although the analysis bore a degree of similarity with remarks of Sir Owen Dixon, writing extra-curially, set out by the majority in Haskins at [45]. Following the quotation (which need not be repeated) the judgment in Haskins continued:

""Or as the celebrated dictum of Field J in Norton v Shelby County [118 US 425 at 442 (1886)] put the same point: 'An unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.'""

147The majority in Haskins then said, ""[w]hether any exceptional qualification can be made to the generality of the principles described by Sir Owen Dixon and Field J need not be examined here"". No reference was made in Haskins to the remarks of Hughes CJ of the United States Supreme Court in Chicot County Drainage District v Baxter State Bank 308 US 371 (1940) referred to in Re Macks. There, Gummow J stated at [221]:

""Hughes CJ said that broad statements as to the effect of a determination of unconstitutionality were to be taken with qualifications and continued [at 374]:

'The actual existence of a statute, prior to such a determination, is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration. The effect of the subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects, - with respect to particular relations, individual and corporate, and particular conduct, private and official. Questions of rights claimed to have become vested, of status, of prior determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly, of public policy in the light of the nature both of the statute and of its previous application, demand examination. These questions are among the most difficult of those which have engaged the attention of courts, state and federal, and it is manifest from numerous decisions that an all-inclusive statement of a principle of absolute retroactive invalidity cannot be justified.'""

148It has long been accepted that the designation of particular acts as ""nullities"" or as ""void"" rather than ""voidable"" is a labelling exercise which is broadly unhelpful. An erroneous assertion of a non-existent jurisdiction will be an action sufficient to engage the supervisory jurisdiction and, where appropriate, the appellate jurisdiction: Ah Yick v Lehmert [1905] HCA 22; 2 CLR 593 at 601 (Griffiths CJ). The present case was not an attempt, as between parties who assumed the validity the relevant legislative act, to undo judicial orders made on the basis of the assumption. Rather, it involved a defence relied on by the State (the author of the legislation), in the proceedings between the same parties and in which the validity of the legislation had been challenged, relying upon an order based on the invalid legislation, as lawful justification for otherwise tortious conduct on the part of its officers.

149It is not necessary to resolve the logical conundrum noted above. The abstract question may be reduced to a specific issue: does the fact that, in resolving the constitutional validity of the Community Protection Act, the Supreme Court was exercising federal jurisdiction mean that the detention order, which was dependent on its opinion that the Act was valid, was made in the exercise of judicial power? Assuming the detention order would otherwise have been an administrative act, like the issue of a warrant, it might seem strange that it should become a judicial act because a challenge had been mounted to the validity of the conferral of power to do the act. If that were so, it would further follow that, assuming the State law were invalid and conferred no power to make an order on the application of the Director, the invalid administrative act would become valid until set aside, but only because the validity of the Act had been challenged. 

150Re Macks accepted that the effect of constitutional limitations on power could only be determined in the exercise of federal judicial power. Thus, the High Court by operation of ss 71 and 76(i) of the Constitution itself, and other courts by legislation pursuant to s 77 of the Constitution, could undertake that exercise. The proposition that an erroneous determination of jurisdiction may nevertheless be effective until set aside flowed in part from s 75(v) of the Constitution which conferred power on the High Court to correct errors on the part of ""an officer of the Commonwealth"", language which encompasses judges of federal courts: at [52] (Gaudron J) and [256] (Kirby J). That factor could not operate with respect to State courts, exercising jurisdiction pursuant to s 39(2) of the Judiciary Act, but other relevant constitutional provisions supporting the same conclusion were identified in Residual Assco Group Ltd v Spalvins [2000] HCA 33; 202 CLR 629. However, that analysis does not assist the State in the present case: rather, it distinguishes Re Macks as a case dealing with orders made in the exercise of judicial power, albeit based on an erroneous assumption as to the Court's jurisdiction. The finding of the High Court in Kable that the Supreme Court was not exercising judicial power in making the impugned order requires a different level of analysis. However, it remained the case that, unless s 39(2) were to be read down so as to remove its operation, the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to consider the validity of the Community Protection Act and hence its own jurisdiction. Thus, the analysis proceeded, its order, based on its view that it had jurisdiction, had some effect until set aside. In other words, the order made in the exercise of State jurisdiction was not an exercise of judicial power because the State legislature was unable to confer such power on the Court, but it became a judicial order because the constitutional challenge was raised. (No such issue arose in Re Macks, the impugned orders being those of the Federal Court.)

151One possible answer to such an analysis is that where a judicial function and an incompatible non-judicial function are purportedly exercised in one proceeding, the incompatible non-judicial function is not thereby incorporated into a single exercise of federal jurisdiction. As noted by Dawson J in Kable, ""it may lead to a very artificial result in a case such as this, namely, that the Supreme Court of New South Wales was exercising federal jurisdiction in ordering the preventive detention of the appellant under a New South Wales Act"": at 87. Dawson J referred to the possibility identified by Barwick CJ in Felton v Mulligan [1971] HCA 39; 124 CLR 367 at 373 that the whole of the ""jurisdiction which is exercised by the Supreme Court throughout the case will be federal ... unless perhaps there is some completely disparate claim constituting in substance a separate proceeding"". 

152A second answer is that it follows from the reasoning in Kable that the purported exercise of the incompatible jurisdiction did not cause the jurisdiction purportedly conferred by the State law to be recharacterised as judicial. Once federal jurisdiction is invoked by reliance on a defence arising under the Constitution, and the whole of the case becomes an exercise of federal jurisdiction, no State law operates except to the extent it is applied by federal law, namely ss 79 or 80 of the Judiciary Act. However, the Judiciary Act will only pick up and apply a valid State law; because the State law is, ex hypothesi, invalid, it will not be picked up and applied. Accordingly, an order under the invalid State law, which could not have been made in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, did not constitute a judicial order.

153Any contrary conclusion would contradict the findings of the High Court in Kable. The majority held that the function conferred on the Supreme Court was not compatible with the exercise of judicial power and involved the Court in an exercise of a non-judicial function: 189 CLR at 98 (Toohey J), 106-107 and 108 (Gaudron J), 122 (McHugh J) and 132 and 134 (Gummow J). Gummow J further accepted the appellant's submission that ""his detention was not ... supported by a valid law of the State"": at 144. The orders of the High Court set aside the detention order made by Levine J and, in lieu thereof, ordered that the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions, seeking the detention order, be dismissed with costs. Accordingly, it is not open to this Court to conclude that the detention order was otherwise than an invalid non-judicial order.

(g) effect of non-judicial detention order 
154The appellant contended that the proceedings in the Supreme Court and the resultant order were so far from being an exercise of judicial power as to be entirely incompatible with it. An order made in exercise of a non-judicial function was not a judicial act, despite the status of the repository of the power and the language and form of the order. Although the order may have had the trappings of a judicial order, it was not an order of the kind which, if made by a judge of a superior court in the exercise of judicial power, is valid until set aside. Accordingly, the order did not enjoy the status of a judicial order and was void ab initio. It followed, the appellant submitted, that, absent an effective statutory protective provision (s 28 of the Community Protection Act which might have provided that immunity having been held invalid with the rest of the Act) the order provided no defence to the claim of unlawful imprisonment. 

155The appellant sought support in the reasoning of the High Court in Love v Attorney-General (NSW) [1990] HCA 4; 169 CLR 307. That case involved challenges to the validity of certain warrants issued by judges of the Supreme Court under the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW). Conversations were recorded and certain persons, including Love and Peters, were charged with offences relating to the supply of heroin. Love and Peters brought challenges to the validity of the warrants, as a step to having the evidence obtained by use of the warrants rejected in the criminal proceedings. In the Court of Appeal, it was assumed or accepted that the warrants were judicial orders: Peters v Attorney General (NSW) (1988) 16 NSWLR 24. The Court of Appeal held that the Listening Devices Act was invalid, pursuant to s 109 of the Constitution, to the extent that it purported to authorise the issue of a warrant for a member of the Australian Federal Police to use a listening device for the purposes of a narcotic inquiry under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth): at 36C (McHugh JA, Kirby P agreeing). McHugh JA rejected the proposition that ""as these warrants were made by judicial orders they are valid and effective until the orders are set aside even if the Listening Devices Act is pro tanto invalid"": at 38B and 41B. The Court declared that the warrants were of no force and effect, to the extent of the inconsistency.

156On appeal to the High Court, the applicants argued that if the warrants were judicial orders, they could not be declared void ab initio, and would not be amenable to prerogative relief: 169 CLR at 309. The Court held (at 318):

""It is first necessary, in order to consider the operation of the warrant, to determine whether the act of issuing it is judicial or administrative in nature. If the issuing of the warrant is an administrative act, then the ambit of the warrant must be determined in the light of the scope of the power conferred upon the court by the statute. ... On the other hand, if the act of issuing a warrant is judicial in nature, then the warrant takes on the attributes of a judicial order.""

157Their Honours continued (at 319):

""In one sense - a loose sense - the warrant is a judicial act; it is an instrument issued by a judge of the Supreme Court. But the fact that it is an instrument issued by a judge of the Supreme Court does not stamp it with the character of a judicial order unless the warrant issues as a result of a determination made by the judge in his or her judicial capacity.""

158Their Honours concluded that the warrants were administrative acts and therefore not judicial orders, continuing (at 322-323):

""Once it is accepted that the warrant is not a judicial order, it becomes an instrument made pursuant to a circumscribed statutory authority.""

159Although reaching the result by a different route, the High Court did not set aside the orders made by the Court of Appeal. Rather, they read down the authority granted by the warrant to conform to the limitations identified in the Listening Devices Act, which, when itself read down, was not invalid. Thus, an order made otherwise than in the exercise of judicial power cannot depend for its authority on the force of a judicial order and derives whatever authority it has solely from the relevant legislation. If the legislation is invalid, the order is without legal effect, in accordance with the principles identified in Antill Ranger and Love.

160The appellant's submission should be accepted. The distinction drawn in Love is consistent with the proposition that only orders made by a judge of a superior court in the exercise of judicial power are valid until set aside and thus provide immunity to those executing them in good faith. 

161The result of that conclusion may be that, absent statutory protection, public officers are exposed to potential liability in damages for obeying what they reasonably believe to be a valid court order. However, the conclusion means no more than that the order was of the kind which could be made by the Supreme Court under the Listening Devices Act, by a District Court judge or by a magistrate: to obtain protection, as has long been recognised, statutory protection is required. Such a provision was contained in s 28 of the Community Protection Act, but, as was expressly held by the High Court, that provision fell with the rest of the Act. Although that provision cannot protect the State, there remains a question as to whether s 46 of the Prisons Act, which conferred immunity on the gaoler, protected the State, despite the terms of s 8 of the Vicarious Liability Act.

(h) statutory protection 
162The potential difficulties faced by the police seeking to execute a void warrant have long been recognised, but have found their solution, not in the general law, but in statute. Thus, a constable executing an invalid search warrant has been held to have no protection at common law in this State, but to enjoy protection originally available provided in England by the Constables Protection Act 1750 (Imp) (24 Geo II, c 44), s 6: Feather v Rogers (1909) 9 SR (NSW) 192. In fact, as explained by Kirby P in Carroll v Mijovich (1991) 25 NSWLR 441 at 447A-C, there has been specific statutory protection for police under New South Wales law since the Police Regulation Act 1899: see also comment as to absence of general law protection in the judgment of Handley JA, at 457F.

163The Constables Protection Act 1750 provided protection to ""any constable, headborough or other officer"" in respect of anything done in obedience to any warrant. The phrase ""other officer"" was held to extend to a gaoler: see M Aronson and H Whitmore, Public Torts and Contracts (Law Book Co, 1982) p 148, referring to Butt v Newman (1819) Gow 97 and Gerard v Hope [1965] Tas SR 15 at 54 and 63. In Butt v Newman, Dallas CJ, sitting in the Court of Common Pleas, noted that, as a matter of statutory construction, ""[i]t would, indeed, be extremely strange if the gaoler who receives a person into his custody under the warrant of a magistrate be not protected, when at the same time the constable who conveys the person to the gaol is entitled to protection"": at 98. Much of the history was set out by Crisp J in Gerard v Hope.

164The Constables Protection Act has not operated in New South Wales since the Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 (NSW); nevertheless, the existence of the statutory protection, dating from 1750, may well explain remarks in cases, made without supporting authority, to the effect that a court officer or other person executing an apparently valid order (though not of a superior court) is protected from liability: eg, Sirros v Moore [1975] QB 118 at 137, Lord Denning asserting that no action would lie against police officers acting in response to a judge's direction, though the direction was invalid where they did not know of the invalidity; see also Aronson and Whitmore, at 151-152. Further, gaolers in New South Wales have enjoyed statutory protection under State legislation preceding the repeal of the Constables Protection Act: Prisons Act, s 46. 

165In the light of this statutory protection, it is implausible that any common law principle now operates in respect of orders purportedly made under statutory authority (and no other authority). Such a conclusion would indicate that Love was determined on a false premise. That should not be accepted. Alternatively, whatever residual common law protection may be available, it has no application in respect of novel forms of statutory order, such as those available under the Listening Devices Act. In the absence of any clear submission as to how such protection could arise in respect of a constitutionally invalid statutory detention order, such a possibility must be put to one side.

166Whatever statutory protection the gaoler may enjoy will not enure to the benefit of the State: Vicarious Liability Act, s 10. Thus, at least since the amendment of s 10, the reference in s 8 to ""the tort committed by a person in the service of the Crown"" must be read as referring to that which would have been a tort, absent statutory protection.

167In these circumstances it is unnecessary to decide whether s 46 of the Prisons Act provided statutory protection to the gaoler. No action was brought against the gaoler and any statutory protection of the gaoler would not relieve the State of the liability it has otherwise accepted under the Vicarious Liability Act. 

168A further possibility, not expressly addressed in argument, was that s 46 extended protection to the State, which protection was not overridden by the Vicarious Liability Act. Section 46 granted immunity to ""any person""; ""person"" is defined to include a body politic: Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s 21(1). However, s 46 operated only with respect to things ""done"" or ""commanded to be done"" by that person. The State did not ""do"" anything directly, as the primary judge correctly concluded. Nor did it ""command"" anything to be done. Furthermore, the act of detaining the appellant was not done ""for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of"" the Prisons Act, but for the purpose of carrying out the purported provisions of the Community Protection Act: see Cowell at 723C-E (McHugh JA). Finally, it seems unlikely that the appellant was a ""prisoner"" within the definition in s 4(1) of the Prisons Act, except by operation of s 22 of the Community Protection Act, which was invalid. Given the absence of reliance by the State on protection under s 46, these questions need not be resolved.

169So far as the State is concerned, no question could have arisen as to its vicarious liability for the unlawful imprisonment by a gaoler so long as it enjoyed ""Crown immunity"". That was effectively abolished in New South Wales by the Claims against the Colonial Government Act 1876, s 3, as construed in Farnell v Bowman (1887) 12 App Cas 643 (PC). Further procedural reforms were made in 1897. That legislation was replaced in due course by the Claims against the Government and Crown Suits Act 1912 (NSW) and, more recently, the Crown Proceedings Act 1988 (NSW), which was in force when these proceedings were commenced. However, the State remained immune from vicarious liability for the acts of public servants in the exercise of independent functions. That immunity was removed by the Vicarious Liability Act in 1983. As explained by the Minister (Mr Frank Walker) in his Second Reading Speech, New South Wales Parliamentary Debates, 3rd series, Vol 174, p 4764-4765 (17 March 1983):

""In respect of the State, however, there are persons in the service of the State who do not have a master and servant relationship with the Government as employer. Examples of such persons are statutory office holders performing functions conferred by their particular statutes, and members of the police force. At present, there can be no vicarious liability on the State in respect of torts committed by these persons as there is no relationship of master and servant. In addition, some of the functions performed by these persons, for example the police officer's powers of arrest, are functions conferred or imposed by the common law or by statute.

The Government has decided that the State should accept liability for the wrongful acts of all persons in the service of the State in addition to those employees who fall within the strict master and servant relationship. ... This liability will apply regardless of whether the function being performed by the person in the service of the State was conferred or imposed by law.""

170The underlying purpose of s 8 of the Vicarious Liability Act was to remove the State's immunity for the acts of officers exercising independent functions (""[n]otwithstanding any law to the contrary""), the immunity being based on the general law principle that liability only arose where the officer acted pursuant to the command of the sovereign, and not pursuant to a statutory duty: see Tobin v The Queen (1864) 16 CB(NS) 310; 143 ER 1148, 1162-1163 (Erle CJ), applied with respect to a wrongful arrest by a police officer in Enever v The King and rejected as inappropriate in policy terms by the NSW Law Reform Commission, Report on Proceedings by and against the Crown (1975) at [13.4]-[13.5] and [13.27]. The State is therefore liable for the acts of its officers in imprisoning the appellant without lawful authority.

(6) Conclusions
171The primary judge was correct to strike out the claims based on malicious prosecution and collateral abuse of process. He was wrong to strike out the claim based on unlawful imprisonment. Accordingly, the appeal is upheld in part. The matter must be returned to the Common Law Division for determination of the outstanding claim. However, it does not appear that any defence remains available to the State and the appellant is entitled to a judgment on the issue of liability for false imprisonment, with damages to be assessed.

172The Court should make the following orders:

(1) Allow the appeal in part.
(2) Set aside the orders in the Common Law Division dismissing the proceedings against the first defendant (the State) and ordering the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings.
(3) In lieu of the judgment and orders below:

(a) give judgment for the plaintiff on his claim against the first defendant (the State) for unlawful imprisonment;
(b) order the first defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings to date in the Common Law Division.
(4) Remit the matter to the Common Law Division for assessment of damages.
(5) Order that the respondent pay the appellant's costs of the appeal.

173CAMPBELL JA: I agree with Basten JA concerning abuse of process and malicious prosecution, and with the orders that should be made. I agree with Allsop P concerning why the claim in false imprisonment should not have been dismissed.

174MEAGHER JA: I agree with Basten JA for the reasons he gives that the primary judge was correct to strike out the claims for malicious prosecution and collateral abuse of process. For the reasons given by Allsop P, the primary judge should not have dismissed the claim for false imprisonment. As those reasons demonstrate, none of the defences relied on by the State in answer to the false imprisonment claim can succeed as a matter of law. For that reason I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA.

175McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit or reading in draft the judgments of the President and Basten JA. I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA.

176I agree with the reasons of Basten JA in relation to all issues except for false imprisonment and in respect of that issue I agree with the reasons of the President.

177Some people may find it to be an odd result that an order made by a judge pursuant to legislation of the State Parliament could be the foundation for tortious liability. However, I am satisfied that result follows from the characterisation by the High Court in Kable of the Community Protection Act (1994) NSW and the act of the judge purportedly done in reliance on it (Allsop P provides a summary of their Honours' conclusions in [3]). The High Court's analysis leads inevitably to the conclusion that the decision to detain the appellant had no legal foundation making the State liable in tort for the appellant's false imprisonment.
