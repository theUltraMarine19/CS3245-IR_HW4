GROUNDS OF DECISION
The accused, Ong Yeow Tian, was tried before me on two charges.
First Charge ""You, ONG YEOW TIAN, are charged that on or about the 15th day of February 1989 at about 2.20 am along Tampines Street 22, Singapore, did use an arm, to wit, by firing one shot at Police Corporal 2418 Goh Soon Wan with a Smith & Wesson revolver No. SPF 5494 with intent to cause physical injury to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 4 of the Arms Offences Act, Chapter 14.""
Second Charge ""You, ONG YEOW TIAN, on or about the 15th day of February 1989 at about 3.20 am behind Block 281, Tampines Street 22, Singapore, did use an arm, to wit, by firing one shot at Corporal 1826146-D Ang Chye Hai of the Special Constabulary with a Smith & Wesson revolver No. SPF 5494 with intent to cause physical injury to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 4 of the Arms Offences Act, Chapter 14.""
The Prosecution Case
At about 2.16am on 15 February 1989 two police officers, Sergeant Omar Bin Mohd Amin (Sgt Omar) and Corporal Goh Soon Wan (Cpl Goh) were manning the Changkat Neighbourhood Police Post (the Police Post) when Lachumana s/o Govindasamy, the driver of taxi No SHA 2765 M, reported that whilst overtaking another taxi No SH 2375, he saw the passenger of that taxi holding a knife in his hand. He feared the driver of SH 2375 would be robbed. Lachumana was, however, unable to give evidence as he had passed away between the date of the preliminary inquiry and the date of trial.
The two police officers got into Lachumana's taxi and the trio set off to find taxi SH 2375. They spotted SH 2375 at the junction of Tampines Avenue 2 and Tampines Street 22. The traffic light at the junction was in their favour, and Lachumana turned his taxi into Tampines Street 22 and came to a stop near SH 2375. The two officers alighted and signalled taxi SH 2375 to stop. Lachumana saw the two of them approach the taxi from the left. He saw the passenger bend down, hold up a revolver and open fire. He immediately drove back to the Police Post.
Cpl Goh testified that he and Sgt Omar approached taxi SH 2375 from the left. Sgt Omar walked round to cover the rear door on the right while Cpl Goh himself covered the rear door on the left, the side on which the passenger was sitting. He drew his revolver as a precautionary measure, pointing it towards the ground, as he had been warned that the passenger was armed with a knife. He saw the window on the accused's side being wound down, and at the same time he heard the accused say ""Don't force me, don't force me"". A moment later, he saw the accused put a hand in his left trouser pocket. At this juncture he was within two feet of the passenger door of the taxi. Suddenly he saw the barrel of a revolver above the window ledge pointing outwards in his direction and then a shot was fired. Cpl Goh fired a shot in return into the taxi, ducked down beside the taxi and ran towards the carpark. From the safety of the carpark he saw the accused run out of the taxi with a hand over his stomach and lost sight of him in Block 285.
Sgt Omar who, at the time of the shooting, was on the offside of the taxi to Cpl Goh, was not able to give significant evidence. He testified that whilst he was running from the rear of the taxi to the passenger door on the other side of the taxi, he heard two shots. Realising that the accused had a revolver, he ran from the taxi into the carpark.
The driver of the taxi SH 2375, Mohamed Bin Syed (Mohamed), gave evidence that on 15 February he had stopped for the accused at approximately 2.10am along Simei Street 3. He asked the accused where he wished to go. Instead the accused asked him if he had seen any roadblocks. After receiving a reply in the negative the accused asked to be brought to Tampines Street 22. En route, the accused instructed him to look for Block 272 or 274. Whilst on Tampines Street 22, he saw two uniformed policemen signalling him to stop. He complied. Thinking that the policemen wished to speak to his passenger, he activated the mechanism that wound down the left rear window which was next to the accused as the police approached him. He then turned to look backwards. He saw the accused attempting to locate the door lever. Mohamed was about to aid him when he saw a revolver in accused's left hand. This shocked him and he pulled back his hand. He then heard the accused say: ""Don't force me, don't force me"". Two gunshots were fired almost simultaneously with the first shot coming from within the taxi. Mohamed told the accused in English not to shoot in his taxi. The accused told him not to worry. A few seconds later the accused opened the door and ran out from the taxi. He immediately drove off to the Police Post to report the incident.
At about 2.50am, the Police Task Force led by Inspector Sng arrived at Simei Avenue in one command vehicle, one landrover and a bus. They were met by Cpl Goh who directed them to Block 281 Tampines Street 22. Five men formed a search and assault party whilst the others performed cordon duty. The members of the search and assault party wore bullet-proof vests. After the team had advanced in single file for 20 to 30 metres movement was sighted in the high bushes, which ran along the rim of the Pan-Island Expressway. The team made an about turn as the movement was behind them. Corporal Ang Chye Hai (Cpl Ang) was now in the foremost position. He was walking in the waist-high drain adjacent to the bushes.
Inspector Sng gave evidence that he heard a shot ring out from the bushes, and he saw Cpl Ang fall backwards. Cpl Ang elaborated on how he had been shot. He stated that as he was moving forward with a torchlight in his left hand he suddenly saw less than five metres away a pair of legs and a hand holding a revolver pointing at him. Before he could react, a shot was fired at him hitting him on the chest over the sternum. He fired a shot as he keeled backwards and fell into the drain. Fortunately for him, because of the bullet-proof vest he wore, the bullet that struck him was not fatal. He did however lose consciousness for several moments.
The assault party fired at the bushes. Sgt Omar Bin Abdullah, a member of the assault team, shouted in English to the accused to surrender. The reply he heard was ""Balls to you, I still have rounds left"". This reply was confirmed by Inspector Sng and another member of the assault team Ong Hock Seng. More shots were then fired by the team at the bushes.
Shortly after that the accused emerged from the bushes with the revolver in his right hand and fell into the drain. Inspector Sng ordered him to drop the revolver. He complied. Cpl Ang took the revolver and handed it back to Inspector Sng. The accused was arrested and taken to hospital.
Subsequently ASP Samadi Bin Aman (ASP Samadi) took over the investigations. He examined the revolver the accused had used, it was a .38 Smith & Wesson numbered SPF 5494. There were four .38 fired cartridges and one .38 bullet in the chambers. The .38 bullet was at the 2 o'clock position.
On 6 June ASP Samadi organised an identification parade at the air-well of the CID lock-up. The accused was identified by Cpl Goh. On 10 June he organised another parade. This time the accused was identified by the taxi driver, Mohamed Bin Said.
ASP Samadi also took statements from the accused on both the charges. Defence counsel disputed the admissibility of these statements. This necessitated a voire-dire.
The voire-dire
On 27 February ASP Samadi went to Changi Prison together with an interpreter Loh Kok Lin to interview the accused. Upon arrival they spoke to Dr Naranjan Singh, the Senior Registrar of Changi Prison Hospital. The latter was asked about the treatment the accused had been given and whether the accused was on any sedative medication. He was told that the accused was not on any sedatives and could communicate normally. A statement not used in the case was taken. On that day the accused was in a wheelchair.
The next day, on 28 February, ASP Samadi and Loh went again to Changi Prison at about 11.20am. They were allocated an interview room. The accused was escorted to the room by the prison warder. He was able to walk slowly.
ASP Samadi stated that the accused looked normal and did not appear to be in pain. He did not complain of any pain. He asked the accused if the part of his stomach that had a bag attached to it owing to an earlier colostomy hurt. The accused replied in the negative. It was ascertained that the accused wished to give his statement in Hokkien. The first charge was read to the accused and interpreted to him. He acknowledged that he understood it and then signed beneath the charge. The same charge was written on a separate sheet and the accused again acknowledged it. The notice of warning in compliance with s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code was written, read and explained to the accused afterwhich the accused signed beneath it. A copy of the charge and warning were served on the accused and he acknowledged receipt. The accused then volunteered a statement. After the statement had been read back to him in Hokkien he signed it. ASP Samadi and Loh then signed under it.
ASP Samadi testified that the second statement was taken five minutes after the completion of the first one, at approximately 11.50am. The same procedure was followed. The accused also initialled against an amendment to the word ""revolver"" in the charge.
On cross-examination it was suggested by defence counsel that the accused could not walk on the 28 February; his voice was hoarse having been under anaesthetic; and he was in great pain owing to a spinal injury and back operation. ASP Samadi would not agree. He was firm that the accused was mentally fit.
Dr Naranjan Singh testified that the accused had had a laparotomy, an exploration of the abdomen, at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. In addition he had been treated for gunshot wounds in his chest, abdomen and left arm. On 25 February when the accused was transferred to Changi Prison Hospital his condition was stable: he had several wounds that required dressing and a colostomy, an artificial passage in the abdomen for the discharge of natural wastes. He was not on any medication. Panadol was given whenever he requested for it. He could walk about the ward and he was not at anytime bedridden. On 28 February the accused had complained of chest pain and cough. He was given Panadol and a cough mixture that contained no sedative. In cross-examination, Dr Naranjan Singh said that the injuries sustained by the accused during the shoot-out were quite serious. He agreed with defence counsel that the accused would not be ""comfortable"" and that he would suffer pain on deep breathing owing to four fractures, but his shallow breathing would be unaffected. However Dr Singh stated he had no trouble communicating with him and thought him to be ""mentally quite clear"".
The accused gave evidence of the injuries he had sustained on 15 February. He said that on 25 February he was still in pain. His left arm hurt whenever he moved; he could not straighten his back owing to a surgical wound; and he experienced pain whenever his right intestines contracted inwards. On 28 February he could not walk with ease. He stated that owing to the pain he suffered, he could not concentrate on the questions put to him by the officers. He had been told that he had to speak there and then. He was also fearful of what might happen to him if he failed to co-operate.
In cross-examination the accused agreed with the DPP that he had given his statements voluntarily and that he had no problem understanding the interpreter. He stated he was afraid because he was surrounded by police officers that morning but he agreed that no one threatened him. He testified that the pain he experienced was not mild, but that he could endure it.
Defence counsel submitted that the notice of warning in s 122(6) amounted to a peremptory order. He contended that although this was not objectionable in the case of an ordinary healthy person the accused in contrast had sustained serious injuries and was not in possession of his full mental capacity, hence there was doubt as to the voluntariness of the statements.
I found no merit in the submissions for the accused. Admittedly the accused was in some pain when he gave his statements but I was more than satisfied that his ability to think clearly was not in any way affected. It is also to be noted that the accused himself said that the statements he gave were voluntary statements. I admitted them in evidence.
The Accused's Statements
The following is his statement in respect of the first charge:
"" I have said that in my statement yesterday that as the taxi which I was in turned into a road, two policemen who were already there stopped the taxi. One of the policemen knocked the window with a baton while the other one fired a shot at me. I was hit on my right chest. So I returned fire at him with the gun I had taken from the other policeman earlier on.""
In respect of the second charge he made the following statement:
"" When I was hiding in the bush, I was surrounded by the Police. A policeman shone a torch at me so I fired a shot at him. I was unable to see him. I fired at the direction of the torchlight.""
At the close of the prosecution case the defence did not make a submission of no case to answer. Upon a review of the evidence, on the facts I have stated, I was satisfied that a prima facie case had been made out against the accused, which if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. I called upon him to enter his defence.
The defence
The accused was a hairdresser before his arrest. He volunteered that he had two previous convictions for drug consumption and another for housebreaking and theft.
In respect of the first charge the accused's defence was that he had not intended to fire at Cpl Goh. He had come into possession of the Smith & Wesson during a struggle with a police officer after a housebreaking incident earlier that evening. Prior to this incident, he had not handled a revolver. After wresting the revolver from the police officer, in the course of which the officer was shot and seriously wounded and later died, the accused ran to the highway and hailed a taxi, telling the driver to take him to Block 272 or 274 near Tampines Street 22. When the taxi was stopped by the two police officers he had wanted to run away. However, as he was about to open the door, the two of them were already in his words ""very close to me"". He, therefore, took out the revolver and said ""Don't force me"" twice. He said that he fired a shot into the air merely to frighten Cpl Goh. At the same time he opened the door of the taxi to make his getaway when he was shot in the right side of his chest. He ran to a block of flats. He realised that the blood from his bleeding wound would cause him to be easily detected in the block of flats, so he ran to some bushes and hid there. In the course of his flight he threw away the knife he had with him in his trouser pocket as it was impeding his movements. At first he lay in a prone position with his face down in the grass. Later when he could not hear any sound he got up and crouched in the bushes.
The accused said that he had no intention to shoot Cpl Ang. He only wanted to run away, if he could get the chance. When he saw the light shining in his direction he fired a shot merely to frighten them so he could flee. He fired at the ground, his intention was not to hit anyone. Thereafter he was shot. He admitted saying: ""Balls to you I still have rounds with me"" when asked to surrender. He stated that he said those words only to anger the police into killing him as he did not intend to live. He stood up hoping the police would fire more bullets at him. Instead he slipped on the slope and fell into the drain.
In cross-examination the accused said that he was right-handed. He admitted asking the taxi driver whether there was a road-block ahead when he entered the taxi. He did not surrender to the police officers when they came up to the taxi because he realised he would face heavy penalties if he were arrested for the incident earlier in the evening from where he had obtained the police revolver. In re-examination he elaborated that he thought he would face the death penalty as the earlier incident involved a police officer and he had used a fire- arm.
He said that he could not open the door of the taxi without using the revolver to make his escape because Cpl Goh was too close; he was ""immediately outside the door"". He agreed with the DPP that when he stated ""Don't force me"" the intent of his words was ""Don't force me to shoot you"". He denied that the revolver was pointed in the direction of Cpl Goh when he pulled the trigger. After fleeing from the taxi it did not occur to him to throw the revolver away. He disagreed that he kept it for use against the police. He also retracted the statement he had made on 28 February that indicated that the police officer had fired at him first.
He admitted that whilst he was hiding in the bushes he did not think of surrendering to the police. He was still hoping that the police would not find him in the bushes. The light shone at him from the left at an angle. He was adamant that he fired at the ground. He retracted the part of his statement that stated that he had ""fired at"" Cpl Ang. However he admitted that he fired in the direction of the torchlight. In re-examination he stated that it did not occur to him that he would hit anyone if he fired in the direction of the light but at the ground. He stated however that he knew there would be someone in the drain otherwise the light would not come from there.
Findings of the Court
After hearing the submissions of defence counsel and the DPP, I found that the facts of this case were substantially not in dispute. The defences to both charges were the absence of mens rea.
On a review of the evidence, I rejected the explanations of the accused on both charges. I found that he had intentionally shot at Cpl Goh when Cpl Goh came to the door of the taxi to question him. Because he had killed another police officer earlier that evening, he clearly intended to evade arrest. Moreover, by the use of the words: ""Don't force me"" he was determined to shoot Cpl Goh to make his getaway. I found no merit in the argument for the defence that if he had aimed at Cpl Goh he would definitely have hit him. It is to be noted that the accused was right-handed whereas when he was in the taxi the revolver was in his left hand; it was also with that hand that he had taken it out from his left trouser pocket; at the same time, he was attempting to open the door; and, as the events happened so quickly he would have had no time to take aim or to fire with any precision, especially when he had no experience of using a revolver.
As for the second charge, I disbelieved the accused that he merely wanted to frighten the police by firing at the ground. The strong evidence against him is that he had shot Cpl Ang squarely on the chest. After that his belligerent reply: ""Balls to you I still have rounds left"" surely was of a man quite ready to shoot it out with the police to the bitter end.
I was satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty on both charges. I convicted him on them and the mandatory death sentence was passed.",1994-02-28 00:00:00,SG High Court
