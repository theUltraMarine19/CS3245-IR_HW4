2708439,R v White & ors (No 1) [2012] NSWSC 465,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: In this trial the accused Rodney White is charged with the murder of Saaid Zaiter on 16 December 2008. The accused Todd Serone is charged with being an accessory after the fact to that murder. A third accused, Jessica Birkensleigh is charged with robbery and accessory after the fact to murder.

2The trial was due to commence on Monday 12 March 2012 at Lismore. That morning, Mr Bodor QC for the accused White indicated that he had received some information from counsel for the accused Serone, Mr Walmsley SC, that had caused him to consider whether an application should be made for a trial for his client separate from the trial of the accused Serone.

3The matter was stood down until 2.00pm on that day to allow Mr Bodor further time to consider the issue. When the matter was resumed it was confirmed that such an application would be made.

Overview of Crown case

4Before dealing with the basis of the application it is appropriate to say something briefly about the Crown case. The following is drawn from the Crown Case Statement.

5The deceased was a drug dealer who was well known to New South Wales and Queensland authorities for his drug supply activities. The accused White was an associate of the deceased and bought drugs from him from time to time. At some stage the deceased would not sell drugs to White because of a debt of $25,000 that White owed to him. 

6On 12 December 2008, the deceased had a number of telephone conversations with White in which White said that he was arranging for people from Melbourne to purchase a large quantity of ""speed"" from the deceased. The deceased told his nephew that he intended to sell three kilograms of the drug to these people for a substantial amount of money.

7On 14 December 2008, White sent a text message to the deceased's former defacto partner, Ms Kristie-Lee Wilson, requesting that she get in touch with the deceased and ask him to make contact with White urgently because some people had come a long way to see the deceased. Ms Wilson forwarded the message to the deceased.

8At the time, White was living in a de facto relationship with the accused Jessica Birkensleigh, in a cabin in a caravan park at Chinderah. Various activities were carried out on the day prior to the murder which I understand the Crown will argue showed planning for a confrontation, at least, with the deceased (for example, hiring a car after providing false identity information; purchase of plastic cable ties; and moving out of the cabin).

9It is unnecessary to go into all of the detail that is set out in the Crown Case Statement. Suffice to say that the deceased attended the cabin at Chinderah on 16 December 2008. White and one Ricky Lee Humphries, who has recently pleaded guilty to manslaughter, assaulted him. The deceased's hands were tied behind his back with black cable ties and tape was placed across his mouth and nose. 

10White and Humphries then left the cabin and were driven away by a friend of White's, Stephen Orams, who had been waiting nearby at White's request. White told Orams, ""I just bashed the cunt and I think he's dead"". 

11White then made various arrangements to get rid of the deceased's car which was parked outside the cabin, and to get rid of the body of the deceased. These arrangements included ringing the accused Todd Serone and asking, ""Is the tow-truck free? I need you to pick up a car at the front of my unit"". He told Serone to call after he had the car on the back of the tow truck.

12White then called Peter Elefsen and asked for his help for a few hours. He told Elefsen to obtain a jerry can with some fuel and to drive towards the Murwillumbah turn-off at Kyogle and to keep his eyes out for the silver Commodore station wagon that White, Humphries and Orams were in. He told Elefsen that he had a car on a trailer with an electrical or fuel problem and he wanted Elefsen to help get it started. 

13White, Humphries and Orams were driving along in the silver Commodore towards Kyogle. White had a conversation with Humphries about places where a body could be disposed of so that it would not be found. Eventually they met up with Elefsen. At White's direction, Orams took Elefsen's car home and Elefsen joined White and Humphries in the silver Commodore.

14Meanwhile, following the telephone call from White, Serone contacted an associate, Alan Waters, who operated a tow-truck business. Waters picked up Serone and they went to the cabin at Chinderah where they found the deceased's car. They proceeded to drive through Murwillumbah and on towards Kyogle, presumably in accordance with directions that had been earlier given by White.

15After Orams had left them, White, Humphries and Elefsen drove off. During the journey, White said that he had ""bashed this cunt and taken his car for payment. That's the car we're picking up"". The silver Commodore and the tow truck passed each other when they were in the vicinity of Mount Burrell, about half way between Murwillumbah and Kyogle. At White's direction, the Commodore was turned around and followed the tow truck. White produced a handgun and fired it in the direction of the tow truck, which then pull over. White alighted from the Commodore and went and spoke with Serone. He then returned to the Commodore which drove away with the tow truck following.

16The two vehicles were driven to a remote bushland location. The deceased's car was taken off the tow truck. White and Serone removed packets of drugs which were secreted within the door cavities. White then threw fuel over the car and set it alight. Serone returned to the tow truck and said to Waters, ""You're not going to believe it. They've just torched this thing"". Waters expressed surprise and decided they should ""get out of here"". Waters drove the tow truck back to the road and proceeded in the direction of Murwillumbah.

17White, Humphries and Elefsen got back into the silver Commodore which was also then driven to Murwillumbah. They caught up to the tow truck when it was stopped at traffic lights. The three occupants of the Commodore alighted and stood in front of the tow truck. Serone got out of the tow truck and walked towards them. White approached him and they had a short conversation. White gave Serone some money. White returned to Humphries and Elefsen and told them to go with the tow truck driver. He told them, ""Don't tell them who you are or where you live. I've told them you're from Melbourne"". 

18White had told Humphries and Elefsen that he planned to move to Western Australia and he wanted another hire car for that purpose. At his direction, Humphries and Elefsen travelled with Waters and Serone in the tow truck to Coolangatta where, ultimately, another Commodore, a blue sedan, was hired. Serone drove this car away with Humphries and Elefsen as passengers. 

19Serone drove to White's cabin at Chinderah. He alighted and went into the cabin. He then returned to Humphries and Elefsen and said, ""He's still there"". All three men then went into the cabin. They saw the body lying on the floor, hands bound with the cable ties, and tape across the mouth and nose. Serone asked, ""Did you boys knock him?"" The three then participated in collecting the body and certain other incriminating items and loaded them into the back of the blue Commodore.

20Serone, Humphries and Elefsen drove away with the body in the boot. They drove towards the Mount Burrell area but stopped along the way. White came along in the silver Commodore and also stopped. White and Serone had a short conversation and while they did so, Humphries and Elefsen got into the silver Commodore. White returned to the silver Commodore and drove off with Serone following in the blue Commodore.

21The two cars stopped in close proximity to each other at an unspecified location. The body of the deceased was transferred from the blue Commodore to the silver Commodore. Serone then drove off on his own in the blue Commodore. White drove the silver Commodore away with Humphries and Elefsen as passengers and the body in the rear.

22White, Humphries and Elefsen then proceeded to a remote bushland location where the body of the deceased and other items were dumped. They left that area, but returned when White decided he would prefer the body to be dumped in a more remote location. Ultimately, the body was pushed over a cliff and various other incriminating items were set alight.

23The balance of the Crown Case Statement refers to various post-offence conduct of some of the accused and other participants. It includes that White was in possession of three blocks of ""speed"" taken from the deceased's car that he said he would cut with powder to produce five times the quantity.

24Ultimately, White and Birkensleigh were arrested near Bendigo, Victoria. There is evidence of considerable purchases made by the pair in the intervening period, mostly in false names, in the order of $157,000.

25Serone provided a statement to police on 24 December 2008. He said that he knew White and the deceased but had not seen them since 13 and 15 December 2008 respectively. He was interviewed on 24 February 2009. He said that he had been contacted by White who had asked that he move a vehicle that was parked at the cabin at Chinderah. He and Waters took the vehicle to the Nimbin/Kyogle area where they met White who fired a shot to get them to pull over. They then took the vehicle to a remote location and as soon as the vehicle was off the tow truck, they left due to the shot being fired earlier. He told police that at the time he gave his first statement he was frightened because he had learnt that the deceased had disappeared, his vehicle had been found burnt out and White was involved in some way. He was afraid of being bashed by members of the deceased's family for being involved in moving his car.

26Serone was arrested and charged on 9 March 2010.

Basis for the application

27There are two bases for the application. First, there is material in the evidence that the Crown proposes to lead in the case concerning Serone that is prejudicial to White. Secondly, the manner in which Serone proposes to conduct his defence will involve prejudice to White. Individually, and collectively, these are said to amount to such prejudice that White cannot be fairly tried if tried jointly with Serone.

28Mr Bodor informed me, and Mr Walmsley confirmed, that the accused Serone's instructions to his legal representatives were to the effect that he was acting under duress when he did what the Crown alleges makes him an accessory after the fact. The threats said to amount to duress will be alleged to have emanated from the accused White. 

29The Crown Prosecutor had previously notified the various defence representatives of portions of police interviews that were thought to be admissible against the interviewee/accused but which might also be thought to be prejudicial against one or the other co-accused. Falling into this category were some portions of the interview by police of the accused Serone on 24 February 2009. Mr Bodor referred to the following passages that he submitted involved prejudice to the trial of his client.

30At Q & A 24 of the interview, Serone told police that White ""used to"" have a substantial cocaine habit and that he was ""with the Mick Gatto family in Melbourne"". (There is also a reference to a family being a ""bit of like mafia type thing and with the Rebels in Sydney"", but this would appear to be a reference to the deceased's family - see Q & A 707; 907).

31At Q & A 37, Serone said that he had ""been up to the Bandidos once or twice, a couple of parties and [White] was there"". 

32At Q & A 707 Serone provided a number of reasons why he was in fear of, inter alia, White and his response included reference to him being ""with the Melbourne mafia"".

33At Q & A 901 - 907, in response to questions about why he did not go to the police, Serone said that he was in fear of White. This was because, amongst other reasons, ""he's Mick Gatto's nephew"". He was told about White being Mick Gatto's nephew by White himself and also by the deceased. 

34Mr Bodor also indicated that he had been told that it will be part of Serone's defence to allege that, at the time of a roadside meeting between the two Crown witnesses, Orams and Elefsen, with the accused White and Serone, White pulled Serone aside and indicated that Orams and Elefsen were two hit men from Melbourne. White subsequently gave orders to Serone to do certain things, threatening that he would be killed if he did not comply. Mr Bodor did not explicitly indicate when it was that this was alleged to have occurred, but I assume this was a reference to the conversation between White and Serone that took place near the traffic lights in Murwillumbah when the silver Commodore caught up to the tow truck. This was before Serone is alleged to have participated in the removal of the body and other items from White's cabin at Chinderah. The only manner in which this will be before the jury will be if the accused Serone gives evidence. Mr Walmsley indicated that he had merely apprised Mr Bodor of his instructions and there was no assurance one way or the other as to whether Mr Serone would be giving evidence.

35Mr Bodor also anticipated evidence that his client confessed to Serone to having killed the deceased. He was unable to identify the source of that evidence but the Crown Prosecutor was able to assist (see below).

36Finally, reference was made to another passage in the interview of Serone on 24 February 2009 (Q & A 777 - 785) in which he was asked about having previously referred to White and the deceased as having been involved in a business that made use of a campervan. He spoke of the pair going to Sydney, doing ""deals"" and then driving back in the campervan. Mr Bodor indicated that he had been given to understand by the Crown that there were other references to that subject matter and so conceded that there was less force in his submission on this aspect. 

37Mr Bodor submitted that each of the matters, but more so collectively, would create irreparable prejudice; that is, prejudice that could not be overcome by any directions that could be given to the jury. With reference to well-known authorities, he characterised it as ""positive injustice"".

Crown response

38In relation to the interview of 24 February 2009, Mr Walmsley confirmed that he wanted each of the impugned passages to remain. Accordingly, the Crown will lead all of that evidence in the case against Serone.

39Responding to the application, it was submitted by the Crown Prosecutor that there will be evidence that White and the deceased had arranged a drug deal on 16 December 2008 involving 3 pounds of amphetamine that was worth about $500,000 to White. There will be evidence of the pre-existing relationship between the pair involving drug dealing. It was indicated that it would be necessary to lead such evidence in order to place the critical events in their proper context.

40In the light of that material, it was submitted that it would be no surprise that White and the deceased had criminal connections, including to crime families and notorious individuals beyond the immediate area of Tweed Heads. The material to which Mr Bodor had referred added nothing to the level of prejudice inherent in the material that will be admitted in the case against White to which no objection is taken. 

41As to the admission said to have been made by White to Serone, the Crown Prosecutor was able to indicate that the source was a prosecution witness, Alan Waters. It is the Crown case that Messrs Waters and Serone assisted in the disposal of the deceased's car. Mr Waters is expected to give evidence that about six weeks after the murder, Serone told him that White had told Serone that he had killed the deceased. Mr Waters is also expected to give evidence of Serone having admitted that he assisted in the disposal of the body. The Crown Prosecutor provided various references to evidence to this effect in an interview by police of Mr Waters on 9 March 2010. The evidence is relevant to the Crown's proof that Serone committed the acts on the afternoon and evening of 16 December 2008 that the Crown relies upon to establish that he was an accessory after the fact, and that he had knowledge of the murder at that time. The evidence is not admissible against White. 

42The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the directions that would be given to the jury would serve to protect White from prejudice that might otherwise flow from the evidence admitted in the case against Serone. There would be a direction as to separate consideration of the cases concerning each accused; a direction that the evidence of Serone's police interview is not available for consideration in the case concerning White; and a direction as to the impermissible use of evidence of bad character of an accused, that is, that the jury must not engage in propensity reasoning.

43The Crown Prosecutor submitted that it was speculative and premature to take into account, in support of an application for a separate trial for White, that Serone had instructed his lawyers that he was acting under duress emanating from White. The police interview of Serone does not establish a reasonable possibility of duress and there would be no evidence of it before the jury unless and until Serone himself gave evidence. There is no guarantee that he will. The Crown Prosecutor, correctly with respect, allowed for the possibility that the application could be renewed if such an eventuality occurred.

Decision

44The principles relating to the question of whether persons charged with involvement in the same crime should be tried jointly or separately were comprehensively considered in the judgment of Sheller JA (James J and Smart AJ agreeing) in Symss v R [2003] NSWCCA 77:

[68] The decision whether or not to grant separate trials involves a consideration of the interests of justice, including conserving costs, the avoidance of inconvenience to witnesses and the desirability of common enterprises being jointly tried so as to avoid inconsistent verdicts.

[69] In an unreported decision of 27 March 1991, in R v Middis 70412 of 1990, Hunt J said on the question of whether there should be separate trials:

""Briefly, the relevant principles are that:

1. where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him, and

2. where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him, and

3. where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,

a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.""

[70] A little later in his judgment at p5 Hunt J said:

""I do not believe that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Oliver [(1984) 57 ALR 543] intended an applicant for a separate trial to demonstrate that positive injustice would more likely than not be caused by a joint trial (as it was suggested in argument); nor do I accept that a mere possibility of prejudice is sufficient (as it was also suggested in argument). In my view, what the Court of Criminal Appeal was saying was that, as some prejudice to one or other accused is inevitable in any joint trial, it must be shown by an applicant for a separate trial that the particular prejudice upon which reliance is placed by him would - if it arises - result in positive injustice to him in a joint trial.""

[71] In Webb and Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 88-89 Toohey J, with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed, said on the question of whether there should have been separate trials:

""King CJ dealt with this ground by pointing out that there are 'strong reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together. That is particularly so where each seeks to cast the blame on the other.' R v Webb and Hay (1992) 59 SASR 563 at 585. What King CJ referred to as 'strong reasons of principle and policy' were discussed by his Honour in Reg v Collie (1991) 56 SASR 302 at 307-311. I respectfully agree with that discussion which emphasises that when accused are charged with committing a crime jointly, prima facie there should be a joint trial. There are administrative factors pointing in that direction but, more importantly, consideration by the same jury at the same trial is likely to avoid inconsistent verdicts, particularly when each accused tries to cast the blame on the other or others Reg v Demirok (1976) VR 244 at 254. There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused Reg v Harbach (1973) 6 SASR 427 at 433.

In the end the critical question before an appellate court in these circumstances is whether, by reason of the joint trial, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice, or put another way, whether improper prejudice has been created against an accused.

In the present case adequate directions were given by the trial judge. It is true that Webb did not give evidence and was therefore not subject to cross-examination, though the jury heard his statements to the police implicating Hay. But, as King CJ observed (1992) 59 SASR at 585: 'That is a commonplace feature of a joint trial and does not of itself render separate trials necessary.' Properly instructed by the trial judge, as they were, the jury were capable of appreciating the use they could make of evidence as against each of the appellants. It has not been shown that a substantial miscarriage of justice is likely to have occurred.""

[72] In R v Patsalis and Spathis (1999) 107 A Crim R 432 Kirby J refused an application for separate trials which was opposed not only by the Crown but also by the co-accused. In his reasons for judgment, which on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal (2001) NSWCCA 476 at 148, Heydon JA, as his Honour then was, described at 148 as a model of their kind, Kirby J said at 434:

""There is a rule, and a proviso to that rule. It is desirable, in the ordinary course, that all persons said to have been concerned with the one crime should be dealt with in the one trial. That rule is subject to the proviso that, if a joint trial would cause positive injustice to an accused, then a separate trial should be ordered; R v Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543.""

[73] Dealing with cut-throat defences Kirby J referred to the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in Ignjatic (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 and to Webb and Hay. In Ignjatic Hunt CJ at CL, after referring to earlier decisions, said at 339:

""Obviously, there will be cases in which cut-throat defences are raised where it may be appropriate to order separate trials, but they would not in my view arise frequently. In a proper summing up, the jury will be directed separately in relation to the evidence admissible against each accused; Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 455. The undoubted prejudice created by such an unsworn statement by a co-accused in a joint trial is usually considerably lessened in such circumstance, and thus it would not amount to the positive injustice required to warrant separate trials."" (emphasis added)

[74] In this Court in Fernando (1999) NSWCCA 66 the trial judge had refused to order separate trials. The Court identified the issue which gave rise to the application for separate trials in these words at para 220:

""The tenor of Brendon Fernando's statements to the police was that while he was present during most of the events which occurred he was subject to the control of Vester Fernando, who was armed with a machete. Indeed, he stated to the police at the time when the victim was killed he was not present, having left the company of Vester Fernando and the victim shortly before the lethal event must have occurred. Thus, while his statements may not be considered as being a complete 'cut-throat' defence they are certainly exculpatory to a degree of his own participation and thoroughly implicate Vester Fernando.""

[75] Brendon Fernando did not give evidence so that his statements were not capable of being tested by either the Crown Prosecutor or Vester Fernando's counsel. Even so, the Court said at para 222:

""However, his recorded admissions do, in the Court's view, fall within the type of evidence adverted to in the authorities and particularly by Toohey J in Webb and Hay which support the contention that there ought to have been a joint trial.""

[76] For present purposes I regard it as sufficient to emphasise the factors identified by King CJ in Collie and Webb and Hay and adopted by Toohey J in Webb and Hay in the High Court. There are important reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together, particularly where each seeks to cast the blame on the other. The dangers from the admission of evidence which would not have been admitted if the appellant had stood trial alone can be obviated by express and careful directions as were given in this trial.

45The prima facie position that persons charged with involvement in the same crime applies in the present case, notwithstanding that White is charged with murder, whereas Serone is charged with being an accessory after the fact. It was involvement in the same crime, but in different capacities. The events in question all took place on the one day; White's alleged crime was followed within hours by Serone's alleged crime. On the Crown case, Serone became involved at the behest of White.

46As to the evidence the Crown proposes to lead against Serone that will not be admissible (nor is sought to be admitted) in the case against White, I am satisfied that appropriate directions to the jury will be adequate to avoid the level of prejudice that would warrant separation of their trials. The type of directions that the Crown Prosecutor alluded to are relatively straightforward and, I am confident, easily understood by juries. My usual approach, and the approach I intend to adopt in this trial, is to summarise for the jury towards the end of my summing up the case that the Crown seeks to make against each accused, and to summarise the response by each individual accused to that case. This approach, coupled with the legal directions about separate consideration, et cetera, will ensure the jury appropriately considers the cases against each accused without the intrusion of material that is only admissible against another accused.

47This is not a case of a ""cut throat"" defence. That is usually where two (or more) persons are charged with committing a crime and each seeks exculpation by blaming the other. It is, however, a case in which, potentially, one accused will attempt to exculpate himself by blaming another; something akin to the situation in R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66. The critical question is whether the possible attempt by Serone to do so will cause unacceptable prejudice, or positive injustice, in the trial of White. That is, in my view, a question that cannot now be answered. I accept the submission of the Crown Prosecutor that it would be a matter of speculation to answer the question in favour of granting the application. It is a matter that can only be assessed in the light of whatever evidence is placed before the jury.

48A further relevant factor identified by the Crown Prosecutor is that much of the same evidence would need to be adduced in the trial of White as would need to be adduced in the trial of Serone, and that each trial would not be substantially different in terms of the length of time they would take. This is a matter that is relevant to the overall interests of the administration of justice but it is far from a decisive matter.

Conclusion

49The application by the accused White for a trial separate to the trial of the accused Serone is refused.

		09 May 2012",2012-03-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708469,R v Vulovic (No. 3) [2012] NSWSC 211,"Judgment (on application by Accused for warnings under s.165 Evidence Act 1995 concerning the evidence of Mr Plavsic) 

1JOHNSON J: At the conclusion of the evidence and before closing addresses, Mr Brady, counsel for the Accused, applied for a warning to be given to the jury under s.165(1)(d) Evidence Act 1995 in the course of the summing up, concerning the evidence of Mr llija Plavsic (MFI15; T413-417). 

2It was submitted that the evidence of Mr Plavsic may be unreliable as it was evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings: s.165(1)(d). 

3Further, it was submitted that an unreliable evidence warning under s. 165(1) should be given concerning the evidence of Mr Plavsic having regard to his state of intoxication. 

4On 5 December 2011, I indicated that I was not then persuaded that a warning under s.165(1)(d) ought be given or that a s.165 warning ought be given on the issue of intoxication (T423-424). This judgment contains my reasons for reaching those conclusions. 

The Evidence of Mr Plavsic in the Trial 

5The Accused was indicted for the murder of Tony Darkovski on 12 November 2009. It was the Crown case that, on that day, the Accused, the deceased and Mr Plavsic were present in a house at Canley Heights. The deceased was stabbed to death that day. 

6Mr Plavsic gave evidence that it was the Accused who stabbed the deceased. 

7The Accused gave evidence at the trial that there had been aggression and provocative words and conduct on the part of the deceased directed towards him with the deceased, at one point, strangling the Accused with the result that he (the Accused) lost consciousness. It was the evidence of the Accused that, although he had not observed how the deceased came to be stabbed, it was not the Accused who had done it. 

8Mr Brady opened to the jury after the Crown opening address. He commenced with the following words (T36.13): 

""BRADY: This is a case about three men. One man, as you have heard, is deceased; one man, as you know, is sitting in the dock (indicated); and one man, who we say is to blame for both of those things, and that man is llija Plavsic, the principal Crown witness."" 

9Counsel for the Accused conducted the trial upon the basis that there was at least a reasonable possibility that it was Mr Plavsic, and not the Accused, who stabbed the deceased, so that the Accused should be acquitted. 

10Against that background, Mr Brady sought a warning under s.165(1)(d) Evidence Act 1995 with respect to the evidence of Mr Plavsic. He submitted that Mr Plavsic was ""a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding"" so as to fall within the provision and to require an unreliability warning to be given under s. 165(2) of the Act. 

11Mr Brady referred to the decision in R v Taranto; R v Freeman [1999] NSWCCA 396 at [38]-[42] in support of the application. 

12Mr Brady submitted that a s.165 warning should be given in this case, so that the jury would be informed of the experience of the courts that a person in the position of Mr Plavsic, may have reason to lie and to shift the blame for his crime to the Accused (T415-416). 

13The Crown opposed the giving of such a warning in this case. It was submitted that the application was redundant because of the way the defence had been conducted so that, should the jury accept that there was a reasonable possibility that it was Mr Plavsic who had stabbed the deceased, then the Accused must be acquitted (T414). The Crown submitted that a s.165 warning would be, at the least, confusing and, at worst, nonsensical given the way that the trial had been conducted for the Accused (T414.19). 

14The Crown submitted that the circumstances of this case did not fall within the terms of s.165(1)(d) so as to require any warning from the Court. To give such a warning in this case, the Crown submitted, would operate in an unduly favourable way to the Accused (T416-417). 

My Reasons for Declining the s.165(1)(d) Application 

15Section 165 Evidence Act 1995 does not deal with unreliability of witnesses generally. Rather, the need for a warning typically arises either because the jury needs to be acquainted with the accumulated experience of courts dealing with certain types of evidence, or because there is a danger that the jury may over estimate the probative value of certain evidence: R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298 at [62]; R v Stewart [2001] NSWCCA 260; 52 NSWLR 301 at 308 [38], 321-323 [95]-[101]; GAR v R (No. 2) [2010] NSWCCA 164 at [97]. 

16Whether the evidence in respect of which a request for a warning is made comes within one of the designated categories, will be a matter for the trial Judge to determine: R v Stewart at 320-321 [95]. 

17Section 165(1) provides that the section applies to ""evidence of a kind that may be unreliable"" , including (in s.165(1)(d)) ""evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding"" . 

18The case mounted by counsel for the Accused at trial was that it must have been Mr Plavsic who killed the deceased, and not the Accused. This is not a case where Mr Plavsic was challenged upon the basis that he was an accomplice. The principal issue in the trial was whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the Accused who stabbed the deceased or whether it was a reasonable possibility that it was Mr Plavsic who did so, in which case, the Accused was entitled to be acquitted. 

19The matters identified in the draft direction (MFI15) as being capable of implicating Mr Plavsic were, in my view, speculative. Further, no plausible motive had been proposed as to why Mr Plavsic would wish to stab his work colleague. Although, it was open to counsel for the Accused to submit that the jury should have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the Accused by contending that there was a reasonable possibility that Mr Plavsic was the assailant, the question for the Court to determine for the purpose of s.165(1)(d) was a different one. The question for the Court was whether the threshold test for a s.165(1)(d) warning had been made out. I was not satisfied that it had been. 

20Further, in the context of this trial, it did not seem to me that the evidence of Mr Plavsic was in a class where the jury might be misled in making an assessment of whether to accept it or in evaluating its worth. There was no special knowledge or experience of that kind of evidence which the Court had and which the jury may not possess, so as to require a warning from the Court. The stark issue from the commencement of the trial was the defence argument that it was Mr Plavsic, and not the Accused, who stabbed the deceased. The credibility and reliability of Mr Plavsic were central issues, and the jury did not require an unreliability warning from the Court. The issue was plain for the jury to see from the outset of the trial. 

21Counsel for the Accused conducted the trial upon the basis that it was Mr Plavsic who stabbed the deceased and thus he (Mr Plavsic) was, by asserting that the Accused was the killer, attempting to shift blame from himself to the Accused. That this was the primary issue for the jury to consider in the trial was self-evident. It was not a scenario which called for a judicial warning under s.165. 

22I accepted the Crown submission that a s.165 warning would be superfluous in this case, and would only introduce unnecessary complication and potential confusion for the jury. 

23The proposed written direction (MFI15) sought a direction from the Court to the jury that ""you might consider that Mr Plavsic is reasonably supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding"". If that was so, then the Accused was entitled to be acquitted. 

24However, even if the present application did fall within s.165(1)(d), the requirement to give a warning under s. 165(2) is not absolute. A trial Judge need not comply with s. 165(2) if there are good reasons for doing so. Where a Judge is required to make a determination that a witness comes within the expression used in s.165(1)(d), but concludes either that the test in the section is not satisfied or that there are good reasons for not giving a warning (s. 165(3)), the Judge should give reasons: Kutschera v R [2010] NSWCCA 150 at [95]ff. 

25In this case, even if I had been persuaded that there was a foundation for a warning to be given under s.165(1)(d), I was of the view that there were good reasons for not giving such a warning in this case. The giving of the warning in this case would have added a judicial warning to what was already clear to the jury. There was a real prospect for confusion and imbalance in the summing up, in the context of this trial. Further, the giving of the warning proposed in MFI15 would have elevated a submission based on a tenuous foundation to a formal judicial warning which would have the flavour of the trial Judge repeating and endorsing the defence submissions. In the circumstances of this case, this would have caused imbalance in the summing up and operated against a fair trial for the Crown and the Accused. 

26It was for these reasons that I declined to give the s.165(1)(d) warning concerning the evidence of Mr Plavsic. 

The Intoxication Issue 

27With respect to the intoxication issue, it seemed to me that the effect of alcohol upon a person was not an issue which required a special warning from the Court, upon the basis that the issue may not otherwise be within the knowledge or experience of members of the community, and thus the jury (T424). 

28The fact that alcohol, when consumed in large quantities, will affect perception and recollection, and the reliability of a person's account of events, is common knowledge. I did not consider that any warning in this regard, based upon the experience of the Courts, was necessary: R v Stewart at 323 [105]. 

29Mr Plavsic acknowledged that he had consumed a significant quantity of alcohol. The jury was given directions during the course of the summing up concerning an assessment of the reliability of the evidence of Mr Plavsic in light of, amongst other things, his consumption of alcohol (summing up, paragraph 47). 

Conclusion 

30It was for these reasons that I declined to give the warnings sought on behalf of the Accused.

2708481,R v Pratten (No 1) [2012] NSWSC 1664,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: The Court has an application for a preliminary ruling on evidence to be adduced, inter alia, so the parties can plan accordingly and so openings can be given that do not traverse inadmissible material. This application relates to the admissibility of the Statement of Stephen Barnes.
	
	
	Much has been put in this application, which is an application pursuant to section s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 for an advance ruling on evidence sought to be adduced. The process that has been adopted, for which, I hasten to add, I congratulate the parties, is one that of itself has given rise to a clarification of the matters that are to be adduced by the Crown and the matters that are not.
	
	
	There are still some aspects of the Statement of Stephen Barns to which the accused objects.
	
	
	Written submissions have been supplied. They are extremely helpful, and not only for the purpose of dealing with this application but generally for the issue that will ultimately face the Court either at the close of the Crown case or on direction of the jury.
	
	
	The difficulty that is faced by the Court is manifest. The material to which objection is taken, and I am not going to deal with the description of it in detail, but deals, amongst other things, with the existence and calculation of default assessment by the Australian Taxation Office, and the table of what is said to have been income received by the accused that should have been the subject of disclosure in the relevant tax returns.
	
	
	At this stage the Court is wholly unaware of what other evidence will be adduced, and upon which this material will be based. It would seem to me that that will necessarily give rise to a problem in dealing with the application at this point in time, and does give rise to such an issue.
	
	
	Ultimately the expression of opinion, if it be opinion, is one based upon the assumption that the evidence will otherwise show certain figures upon which Mr Barns has relied.
	
	
	Secondly, the fact of the subsequent assessment, being a default assessment, is a matter that, on one view, could rationally affect the existence of an issue in the proceedings, being the obtaining of financial advantage and/or the motive that may have existed in the alleged non-declaration of the income in the return.
	
	
	Having said that, Mr Leighton-Daly, who appears for the accused, stresses the unfair prejudice that attains by such an opinion were before the jury. Whether that unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value, or vice versa, and I am not now talking of the onus that pertains, if there be an onus, under s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act, can only be assessed when one has regard to the other material that is before the jury. Therefore, pursuant to the terms of s 192A of the Evidence Act, I do not consider it to be appropriate to make the ruling at this preliminary stage.
	
	
	The parties' rights to re agitate the issues at a more appropriate time are of course reserved fully.

		29 April 2016",2012-03-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708490,Jeffery v R [2012] NSWCCA 36,"Judgment

1McClellan CJ at CL: The Court is in a position to give judgment. I will ask Johnson J to give the first judgment.

2Johnson J: The Applicant, Daniel Martin Jeffery, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed at the Sydney District Court on 16 September 2011.

3The Applicant pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (513.9 grams of liquid methylamphetamine) contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

4In addition, the Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime ($46,700.00 in cash) contrary to s.193B(2) Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by imprisonment for 15 years.

5On the first count, his Honour Judge Bozic SC sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of five years commencing on 25 March 2010 and concluding on 24 March 2015, with a balance of term of three years concluding on 24 March 2018.

6On the second count, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of one year and 10 months commencing on 25 March 2010 and concluding on 24 January 2012, with a balance of term of one year and two months concluding on 24 March 2013. 

7The sentencing Judge was asked to deal with, as related offences under s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, two counts of driving whilst disqualified. In relation to each of these matters, the Applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for six months commencing on 25 March 2010 and expiring on 24 September 2010. The Applicant was disqualified from driving for a period of two years commencing on 4 October 2016.

8The total effective sentence comprised a head sentence of eight years and a non-parole period of five years.

Facts of Offences

9The agreed facts may be summarised as follows.

10Strike Force McKickle was established in April 2009 to target the illegal activities of members of the Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle Gang. On 9 March 2010, a warrant was issued authorising police to install surveillance cameras in storage shed 2001 at the National Storage complex in Minchinbury, which was hired by the brother of the Applicant's partner. The cameras were installed in that storage unit on 12 March 2010.

11On 19 March 2010, police executed a covert search warrant in relation to the storage shed where they located a blue esky containing three water bottles containing approximately 2.9 kilograms of liquid methylamphetamine, a Jack Daniels' bottle containing 513.9 grams of liquid methylamphetamine, a semi-automatic rifle, a Luger pistol, a ballistics vest and ammunition. Police seized the rifle and substituted the three water bottles in the blue esky with similar water bottles.

12On 22 March 2010, the Applicant entered the storage unit and decanted the contents of the Jack Daniels' bottle. Police executed a further covert search warrant that day. They seized the Jack Daniels' bottle and substituted it with a similar item. On 23 March 2010, the Applicant attended the shed with Mr Gary Pearce. The Applicant removed a bag containing the substituted Jack Daniels' bottle.

13At 4.14 pm on 24 March 2010, Mr Pearce and Rishaad Christian attended the storage shed and removed a red metal tool box, the blue esky and a kit bag. They went to Mr Christian's house before going to the Applicant's house. At about 4.40 pm that day, the Applicant, Mr Pearce and Mr Christian went to the National Storage complex where they asked an employee about the apparent break-in. The three men were then arrested by police.

14Search warrants were executed at the houses of each of the offenders later that day. At the Applicant's house, police located the substituted Jack Daniels' bottle which had been smashed, and $46,700.00 in cash. The Applicant's DNA was located on the Jack Daniels' bottle earlier seized by police.

15The two offences of driving whilst disqualified, for which the Applicant was dealt with under s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, were committed on 13 and 23 March 2010. At those times, the Applicant was disqualified from driving until 5 October 2014.

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

16The Applicant was born in 1976 and was 33 years' old at the time of the offences and 34 years' old at the time of sentence.

17The Applicant has a criminal history dating from 1993, including, as an adult offender, offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (in 1996), low-range PCA and drive whilst suspended (in 1999), mid-range PCA (in 2003), possess prohibited weapon (in 2004), possess loaded firearm, low-range PCA, drive whilst disqualified, resist police and dangerous driving (in 2006) and drive whilst disqualified (in 2009).

18The Applicant served terms of imprisonment for his 2006 offences, involving a head sentence of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of only six months. This lenient sentencing outcome no doubt reflected the report of Professor Stephen Woods, psychologist, which was before that sentencing Court. 

19At the time of the subject offences, the Applicant was subject to conditional liberty, in the form of a s.9 bond to be of good behaviour for 18 months for the offence of drive whilst disqualified, for which he was sentenced on 27 October 2009. As a condition of that bond, the Applicant was placed under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service with orders for counselling and supervision. 

20It does not appear that the Applicant took advantage of the leniency extended to him in 2006 and 2009. The evidence suggests that, in 2008 or 2009, the Applicant joined the Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle Gang.

21In addition to the sentences imposed on 27 October 2009, the Applicant was disqualified from driving for a period of two years from 5 October 2014. 

22A psychologist's report of Professor Woods dated 3 August 2011 was tendered at the sentencing hearing. In addition, a number of references and certificates were tendered. The Applicant and his partner, together with a Mr Williams, gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. Aspects of this evidence are the subject of grounds of appeal to this Court. 

Grounds of Appeal

23The Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a)Ground 1 - that the Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity of the sentence imposed upon him for the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine compared to that imposed upon the offender, Gary Pearce, for supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.

(b)Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred in rejecting the Applicant's account of how the Applicant came to be in possession of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.

(c)Ground 3 - the sentence was manifestly excessive having regard to the Court's finding that the objective seriousness of the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug was substantially below the middle range of objective seriousness.

(d)Ground 4 - that the sentencing Judge erred by finding ""that the money is likely to be related to the supply of drugs"".

Ground 1 - The Complaint of Disparity by Reference to the Sentence Imposed Upon Gary Pearce

24In the course of summarising the facts of the Applicant's offences, the sentencing Judge referred to acts of another person, Gary Pearce. Mr Pearce was sentenced by the same Judge on 23 September 2011 for offences of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (2.815 kilograms of liquid methylamphetamine) contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, an offence punishable by imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. An offence of goods in custody was taken into account on a Form 1 with respect to that offence.

25In addition, Mr Pearce was sentenced for possession of a prohibited pistol contrary to s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996, an offence punishable by imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of three years. An offence of possess ammunition contrary to s.65(3) Firearms Act 1996 was taken into account on a Form 1 with respect to that offence. 

26For the firearms offence, Mr Pearce was sentenced to a non-parole period of one year and seven months to date from 25 March 2010 and to expire on 24 October 2011, with a balance of term of 11 months to expire on 24 September 2012. For the drug supply offence, Mr Pearce was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years and six months to date from 25 September 2010 and to expire on 24 March 2015, with a balance of term of three years to expire on 24 March 2018. 

27The total effective sentence for Mr Pearce comprised a non-parole period of five years with a head sentence of eight years.

Submissions

28Mr Wendler, counsel for the Applicant, submits that the Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to the sentences imposed upon Mr Pearce and himself. He submits that the Applicant and Mr Pearce had been engaged in the same criminal enterprise, regardless of the charges actually laid against each of them, so as to attract the principle of parity or proportionality or relativity referred to by Howie J in Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at 596 [246]. Counsel relied, as well, upon the recent decision of the High Court of Australia in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 86 ALJR 36 at 44-45 [30].

29Mr Wendler contended that the Applicant and Mr Pearce had similar antecedents, but that the Applicant was sentenced for a less serious drug supply offence. All of this, it was submitted, warranted the imposition of a less severe sentence upon the Applicant.

30The Crown accepted that the parity principle is not confined to co-offenders charged with the same offence, and that it may apply to offenders charged with different offences arising from the same criminal enterprise: Green v The Queen; Jimmy v The Queen at 574 [136], 588 [202], 596 [245] and 598 [262]. The question is whether the Applicant and Mr Pearce were involved in the same criminal enterprise.

31The Crown submitted that the Applicant was not being sentenced in relation to the 2.815 kilograms of liquid methylamphetamine located in the three water bottles and Mr Pearce was not being sentenced in relation to the 513.9 grams of liquid methylamphetamine contained in the Jack Daniels' bottle. Nor, it was submitted, were the drugs in each offender's possession for the same purpose, other than broadly for the purpose of supply. 

32The Crown pointed to the Applicant's evidence, which was not accepted by the sentencing Judge, concerning the Applicant's intention with respect to the drugs to which he pleaded guilty. An entirely different account and motive was given by Mr Pearce in relation to the drugs which he possessed. The sentencing Judge accepted Mr Pearce's account that he agreed to store the three bottles of liquid methylamphetamine to clear a drug debt and to avoid further threats from a dealer to whom he had become indebted. 

33The Crown submitted that the Applicant and Mr Pearce were not involved in the same criminal enterprise, and the fact that their criminal conduct was uncovered by the one police investigation did not make them co-offenders for the purpose of the parity principle: Furia v R [2010] NSWCCA 326 at [62]-[65].

34Even if the parity, relativity or proportionality principles could apply to this case, the Crown submitted that no objective justifiable sense of grievance had been established on the part of the Applicant. The Crown submitted that there were significant differences in the subjective circumstances of the two offenders. The Applicant was aged 33 years at the time of his offence whilst Mr Pearce was 23 years' old. The Applicant had a more substantial criminal history and was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the commission of his offences.

35The sentencing Judge accepted that Mr Pearce was genuinely remorseful and had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. The sentencing Judge found that the Applicant's remorse was ""at best, limited"" and that he had moderate prospects of rehabilitation.

36The Crown submitted that there were differences in the objective seriousness of the offences as well. Although Mr Pearce's offence involved a greater quantity, motivation was also relevant to culpability and favourable findings had been made in the case of Mr Pearce in this respect. The sentencing Judge found that the Applicant's offence fell just below the mid-range of objective seriousness, whereas Mr Pearce's offence fell ""around mid way between the middle and lower end of the range of objective seriousness"".

37Taking the objective culpability of each offender and their subjective cases into account, the Crown submitted that it cannot be said that a justifiable sense of grievance arises from the sentences imposed on the Applicant as compared with those imposed upon Mr Pearce for his offences. 

Decision

38Although it may be said that there is some factual connection between the Applicant's offences and those of Mr Pearce, given that the drugs in question were found in the same locality, there are significant differences in the objective circumstances of their offences and the subjective circumstances of the two offenders.

39The decisions of the High Court of Australia in Green v The Queen and of this Court in Jimmy v The Queen, indicate that parity or proportionality or relativity grounds are not to be strictly confined to co-offenders charged with the same offence. That said, the principles still require an examination of the circumstances of the offences for which each offender was sentenced and the circumstances of the offender in each case. 

40The same sentencing Judge sentenced Mr Pearce and the Applicant. It is noteworthy that his Honour's remarks on sentence for Mr Pearce do not refer to the sentence imposed upon the Applicant. It does not appear that any submissions were directed to his Honour, for the purpose of sentencing Mr Pearce, concerning parity, proportionality or relativity. That does not disentitle the Applicant from advancing submissions based on those principles in this case. However, it is noteworthy that the same sentencing Judge was not invited to compare and contrast the two offenders when he came to sentence Mr Pearce. Yet, this Court is asked to do so on appeal.

41The circumstances in which each offender possessed the relevant quantity of drugs were quite different. The findings of the sentencing Judge concerning Mr Pearce's motive is an important point of distinction. His Honour found that Mr Pearce was effectively a warehouseman, and a warehouseman acting under some pressure. 

42There are significant differences in the subjective circumstances of the two offenders as well. Amongst these is the fact that the Applicant was substantially older than Mr Pearce. The Applicant received lenient sentencing outcomes involving conditional liberty (an extended period on parole in 2006 and a bond in 2009) but then, at the age of 33, engaged in serious criminality involving substantial drug supply. The Applicant cannot claim the immaturity of youth as being a factor which bears upon his criminal conduct: R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 at 127 [72](k). Mr Pearce was in a different position. He was 23 years' old. This was a significant factor on sentence. 

43Further, the Applicant was on a good-behaviour bond at the time when he committed these offences.

44Even if it could be concluded, somewhat tenuously, that the Applicant and Mr Pearce were engaged in a similar criminal enterprise, I am entirely unpersuaded that any objective foundation for grievance, and thus a legitimate sense of grievance, is available for the Applicant as a result of the sentences imposed upon Mr Pearce.

45It has not been demonstrated that the sentencing outcome for the Applicant was unjust by reference to the principles of parity, proportionality or relativity.

46I would reject the first ground of appeal.

Ground 2 - Suggested Error in Rejection of the Applicant's Account as to How he Came to be in Possession of the Prohibited Drug

Submissions

47Mr Wendler acknowledged that the Applicant bore the onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities, with respect to any factual finding which was said to mitigate his criminality. However, he submitted that the evidence was effectively all one way so that the sentencing Judge had erred in not making a finding in the Applicant's favour on this issue.

48The Crown submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to make findings unfavourable to the Applicant on this aspect. The credibility of the Applicant's account was clearly an issue at the sentencing hearing. The Crown made submissions that the Applicant's evidence ought not be accepted. It was submitted that the fact that there was no direct evidence inconsistent with the Applicant's account did not mean that the sentencing Judge was bound to accept it.

Decision

49This ground of appeal seeks to challenge a finding of fact by the sentencing Judge.





50His Honour rejected the Applicant's explanation in the course of the following findings (ROS7):

""Having seen and heard the offender, I do not accept his account of how he came to be in possession of the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. Apart from the pure coincidence that he was arrested at a time when he says he had decided to leave the Rebels and pack his bags, there is the inherent unlikelihood of being in possession of more than twice the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine for one last big party, and further, the inherent unlikelihood that a drug dealer would provide a large amount of methylamphetamine without requiring any payment at the time of or before delivery.

On the other hand, there were no indicia of drug supply such as ledgers or scales. There was no evidence adduced suggesting that the drug was to be sold to others for financial gain, despite telephone taps and surveillance over a relatively extended period. Despite the surveillance, there is no evidence the offender was a principal within a distribution hierarchy.

In these circumstances, I will sentence the offender on the basis that he had over twice the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine of a purity of 61.5% in his possession for the purposes of supply. I am, however, unable to make any further findings as to his involvement.""

51It is necessary to keep in mind the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court where a finding of a sentencing Judge is challenged on appeal. A frequently cited and applied statement of principle is that of Hunt J (Carruthers and Wood JJ agreeing) in R v O'Donoghue (1988) 334 A Crim R 397 at 401. The principles were succinctly stated by McCallum J in McBeth v R [2009] NSWCCA 235 at [30]:

""Many of the applicant's grounds concern the sentencing Judge's findings of fact. It must be recalled, however, that the task of this Court is confined to determining whether there was error in the sentencing of the applicant on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. This Court's power to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the trial judge arises only if the Judge 'mistakes the facts' in the sense there understood. It is necessary to establish that there is no evidence to support the finding, or that the evidence is 'all one way', or that the Judge has misdirected himself: R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401 per Hunt J, Carruthers and Wood JJ agreeing'.""

52Having considered the evidence given at the sentencing hearing, it was entirely open to the sentencing Judge to reject the Applicant's account. His Honour had observed, in the course of submissions made by counsel for the Applicant, that the Applicant's account appeared ""inherently improbable"", a view which his Honour clearly maintained in his remarks on sentence. The submissions made at that time by the Applicant's counsel did not involve strong opposition to that proposition, but rather focused upon avoiding a conclusion that the rejection of the Applicant's evidence should lead to some more sinister and adverse conclusion. The Crown had submitted that the sentencing Judge would find that the Applicant was ""a very vague and unimpressive witness"" whose ""credit is quite low"" and that he should not be accepted as a witness of credit. 

53It was open to the sentencing Judge to make these findings, having seen and heard the Applicant give evidence. The conclusion reached by his Honour was hardly surprising.

54I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 3 - The Claim of Manifest Excess by Reference to the Finding Concerning the Objective Seriousness of the Drug Supply Offence

55As argued in writing, this ground focused upon the claim that the sentencing Judge had found that the drug supply offence lay ""substantially below the middle range of seriousness"" for this type of offence. However, as is apparent from the transcript, his Honour corrected this erroneous statement at the sentencing hearing, with his Honour indicating that his finding was that the offence was ""just below the mid range of objective seriousness"". 

56The argument proceeded in this Court upon the basis that the finding should have been that the offence lay substantially below the middle range of seriousness. 

57This Court has emphasised that the characterisation of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing Judge, in finding facts and drawing inferences from them: Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35 at [33]-[34].

58It is sufficiently clear that the sentencing Judge identified and corrected the finding which had been made concerning the objective seriousness of the drug supply offence, noting that he had erred in his reading from notes. 

59I am entirely unpersuaded that any error has been demonstrated with respect to this ground of appeal. His Honour's characterisation of this offence was explained by reference to the quantity and purity of drug and his finding concerning the Applicant's involvement in the offence. The finding was open to the sentencing Judge.

60There is no substance in this ground of appeal which should be rejected.

Ground 4 - Suggested Error in Finding that the Money was Likely to be Related to the Supply of Drugs

61Counsel for the Applicant submitted that his Honour had erred in making a finding to this effect (ROS12):

""As I have indicated above, I do not accept the offender's account of how he came to be in possession of the $46,700.00. That money is likely to be related to the supply of drugs"". 

62The argument that was put is that the lastmentioned finding was inconsistent with his Honour's findings with respect to the drug supply offence itself. 

63To the extent that the written submissions in support of this ground complained of a breach of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383, that argument was not pressed at the hearing. 

64The short answer to this ground is that the Applicant pleaded guilty to an offence under s.193B(2) Crimes Act 1900. By that plea, he admitted the elements of the offence. The offence involves a person dealing with the proceeds of crime, knowing them to be the proceeds of crime. The term ""proceeds of crime"" is defined as meaning any property that is substantially derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from the commission of a serious offence. ""Serious offence"" is defined as including, amongst other things, an offence against the law of New South Wales that may be prosecuted on indictment. 

65The plea of guilty of the Applicant admitted the elements of the offence, and that is sufficient to dispose of this ground of appeal. 

66I observe, in any event, that the sentence imposed for the second count was entirely concurrent with the sentence on the first count, and the non-parole period for that offence has expired already.

67I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Conclusion

68I am entirely unpersuaded that any of the grounds advanced for the Applicant have been made good. However, even if there was some merit in any of the grounds, the fact remains that the Applicant received entirely concurrent sentences for these offences. Further, he obtained the benefit of the drive whilst disqualified matters being dealt with in the District Court in a manner which meant that no additional sentence could be imposed for those matters (despite the fact that he was a recidivist for this class of offence).

69Even if some error had been demonstrated (and it has not), I do not consider that any lesser sentence is warranted for the Applicant's offences for the purposes of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

70In my view, the grounds of appeal are sufficiently unmeritorious that leave to appeal against sentence should be refused.

71MCCLELLAN CJ AT CL: Johnson J has, in his usual comprehensive manner, competently discussed each ground of appeal. As his Honour's analysis makes plain, none of the grounds have any merit at all. For that reason, I join with him in agreeing that leave to appeal should be refused.

72GROVE AJ: I also agree with Johnson J. I also agree with the observations of the presiding Judge. 

73MCCLELLAN CJ AT CL: The order of the Court is that leave to appeal is refused.

2708494,KR v R [2012] NSWCCA 32,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA : I agree with Latham J. 

2LATHAM J : This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed following pleas of guilty to one count of Murder and two counts of Assault with Intent to Rob in Company (s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900). Murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The robbery offences each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 

3Fixed terms of 12 months and 6 months imprisonment were imposed in respect of the robbery offences. A non parole period of 12 years with a balance of term of 6 years and 9 months was imposed on the murder count. The total sentence of imprisonment was 19 years and 6 months, including a non parole period of 12 years and 9 months. 

4The sentence imposed by the same judge (Howie J) on the co-offender (LR) for Murder and one count of Assault with Intent to Rob in Company is said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant (Ground 1). It is further claimed that the applicant was denied procedural fairness by virtue of the judge's revision of the discount for the pleas of guilty from 20% to 15% without hearing further from the applicant (Ground 2). 

The Offences 

5Shortly after 11 pm on 13 June 2008, the applicant (then aged 17 years and two months) and his friend LR (then aged 16 years and 7 months) decided to rob someone. Both offenders were intoxicated. 

6Shortly after midnight on 14 June 2008, a 31-year-old man was found dead in the driveway of his home by his flatmate. His wallet was found in the driveway and was empty of cash. DNA in the wallet matched the applicant's DNA. The deceased's keys were found a short distance away but his mobile phone was missing. The offenders had stomped on his head and face a number of times. Shoe patterns were found on his skull, face and neck. His ribs were fractured. In effect, the deceased had been kicked to death. 

7Between 11:45 pm and 12 am a 20-year-old male was riding his bicycle when he was knocked off and robbed by the offenders. This offence is the subject of the assault with intent to rob in company offence, with which both were charged. 

8At about 11:55 pm the offenders encountered a 26-year-old female. The applicant hit her to the back of the head, demanded her wallet and then punched her twice to the face and kicked her in the cheek area. This was the subject of the second assault with intent to rob in company offence, with which the applicant alone was charged. There was no satisfactory explanation before the judge as to why LR was not charged with this offence. 

9The relevant findings of fact by the judge for the purposes of sentencing the applicant on the murder charge appear from the remarks on sentence delivered on 19 March 2010. It is helpful to set parts of the remarks out in full ([10] - [16]), particularly for the purposes of the parity ground. 

The facts stated that both LR and the offender acted jointly to cause the death of the deceased and did so with the intention that grievous bodily harm would be inflicted upon him. It is also stated that both offenders participated in the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. 

A clear inference from the facts is that the offender inflicted at least some of the identifiable shoe prints upon the deceased's head. However the facts in relation to the robbery of Ms Gay state that, where LR had been seen by the victim to be standing at the time she was robbed by the offender, a shoe print similar to those identified upon the deceased's head was found. It was put to me that I should find that this print was left by LR and, therefore, I should conclude that he was responsible for the infliction of injuries to the head of the deceased. 

No shoes were recovered from LR that bore that shoe print yet two pairs of shoes obtained from the offender did. There is nothing to suggest that the police would not have taken all the shoes LR had in his possession. It is highly likely that the print recovered from where LR had been standing was also made by the offender at some time around the robbery of Ms Gay. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender inflicted the shoe prints found upon the deceased's head. However, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he alone was responsible for the injuries inflicted to the head and face of the deceased. For the purpose of sentencing the offender I am satisfied that both offenders were equally responsible for the death of the deceased. (italics not in original) 

I understand that there is an inconsistency in the facts upon which I sentence the two offenders in relation to the murder, but that is the result of the different evidence before me. This has been brought about to a large degree because I could not sentence the offenders together. This was a result of this offender sacking his barrister and then contemplating whether to withdraw his pleas of guilty. I was not prepared to delay sentencing LR while there was uncertainty as to whether this offender would maintain his pleas of guilty. 

It is also a result of the decision of the offender not to give evidence before me. He is not treated more harshly simply because he did not give evidence. But I have no account from him to explain the circumstances in which the killing took place. Although I have always had doubts about the honesty of the account given by LR, it was not challenged by the Crown and was not inconsistent with the agreed facts. 

Counsel for the offender tried valiantly to maintain that I should impose the same sentence upon both offenders according to the principle of parity. But because the factual basis upon which I sentenced LR is different to the factual basis upon which I sentence this offender, there must be disparity in the sentences imposed. If I impose the same sentence on this offender as I did on LR, then LR would have grounds to complain that he was unfairly treated having regard to the mitigating facts found in his favour. 

As I stated when sentencing LR this was a bad case of murder. Both accused were fortunate to have the Crown agree that there was no intent to kill, presumably on the basis of the intoxicated state of the offenders. I have difficulty accepting that even an intoxicated person would not realise the severity of the injury being inflicted by repeatedly stomping on the head and face of a person who is lying on the ground unable to defend or protect himself. But in any event the grievous bodily harm they must have intended to inflict upon the deceased was very grave indeed and there was such an obvious high risk of death resulting that there is little mitigation in the fact that they did not act with the intention of killing the deceased. 

10The facts underlying the robbery offences were summarised by the judge at [18] and [19] as follows :- 

The facts of the robbery offences can be stated briefly. The first of these was an attack upon a male cyclist aged 20 who suffered minor injuries when attacked while riding on the Illawarra Road, Marrickville. The victim could not remember the incident. Items of the victim were later recovered and on an identification card were found the fingerprints of the offender. 

The other robbery was more serious. Ms Gay was walking on Illawarra Road when the offender struck her to the back of the head. She was knocked off her feet into a fence. She slid to the ground. The offender then snatched the bag causing the strap to break. He poured out the contents on the footpath. He demanded her wallet but she said she did not have one. The offender then punched her hard twice to the head and kicked her in the left cheekbone. Fortunately for the victim a bus came by and she was able to flag it down. She asked the driver to call police and the offender and LR ran into a park. The victim suffered redness and swelling to her cheekbone, tenderness to her right cheek and a lump over the right ear. These were not the type of injuries that would aggravate the offence although it is relevant that she suffered actual violence and not simply the threat of violence. 

The Sentencing of LR. 

11When sentencing LR on 3 February 2010 ( R v LR [2010] NSWSC 22), his Honour said :- 

[5] There was an agreed statement of facts tendered but it was augmented by evidence given from the offender who adopted an account he gave to a psychiatrist .. of the circumstances of the killing. He was not cross-examined on this aspect of his evidence. 
[16] ... The offender gave an account that was not challenged in cross-examination. He stated that the co-accused hit the victim of the robbery off his bike and knocked him out. The victim's pocket was searched but little of value was found. They walk toward nearby flats when a taxi stopped and the deceased alighted. The offender claimed he was urinating at the time. According to him the co-accused almost immediately attacked the deceased and started kicking him. The offender ran up and kicked the deceased once to the face. He thought that ""things were getting out of hand"" and tried to stop the attack by the co-accused but he was unsuccessful. When the violence eventually ceased the offenders searched the deceased's pockets. He gave the co-accused the wallet and keys he found but kept the mobile phone. 
[17] I am prepared to accept this account although I believe that the offender is minimising his involvement in the assault. In any case on his account he witnessed what was happening to the unfortunate deceased and joined in the violence by kicking the defenceless man in the face. 
[23] The offender pleaded guilty 11 months after the charges had been laid but while still in the Children's Court. He should receive a discount of 20% for the utilitarian value of his plea. I accept now that he is genuinely remorseful. 
[26] .... I accept that in the infliction of violence the offender played a lesser role than his co-accused, but he was a willing participant in the causing of serious injury upon the deceased simply for that purpose. He was the initiator of the criminal activity that resulted in the killing and serious robbery offence. The Crown accepts that there was no intention to kill but I believe the intention of both the offender and his co-accused was to inflict grievous bodily harm to a very significant degree. 
[32] The offence committed by this offender was a serious case of murder because it was so senseless and vicious. Although unplanned, the offender and his co-accused planned to use violence to rob some person. There is some mitigation in the fact that the offender tried to stop his co-accused but only after he had himself joined in a brutal attack on a completely innocent and defenceless person. 

12Ultimately, his Honour regarded the appropriate starting point for the offence of murder, before the application of the discount for the plea of guilty, as 19 years, 3 years less than the starting point adopted for the purposes of sentencing the applicant. 

Ground 1 : Parity 

13The italicised passage in the remarks set out at [9] above is central to the applicant's argument on this ground. The applicant submits that the statement ""both offenders were equally responsible for the death of the deceased"" is equivalent to a finding by his Honour that both offenders were equally culpable, thus requiring the imposition on each offender of the same or relevantly similar sentence for the murder. The reference to ""relevantly similar"" recognises that different discounts for the respective pleas of guilty were applied to the notional starting points for the sentence, although the applicant also takes issue with the assessment of the discount. 

14The applicant went further and asserted that there was nothing in the remarks on sentence that indicated his Honour considered the applicant more culpable than the co-offender. 

15The applicant's argument invites attention to the basis upon which each offender was charged with the murder, namely, joint criminal enterprise, and to the distinction in law between criminal responsibility and culpability. 

16As James J observed (McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing) in R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3, when dealing with a joint criminal enterprise to cause grievous bodily harm which involved stomping on and kicking the head of the victim :- 

28 If this conduct by other persons was done in the carrying out of a joint criminal enterprise to which the respondent was a party, then the respondent was to be sentenced for that conduct under the principle that a party to a joint criminal enterprise is to be sentenced for the full range of the criminal acts done by any of the parties to the joint criminal enterprise in the carrying out of the enterprise R v Cotter & Ors [2003] NSWCCA 273 especially per Carruthers AJ at 90. 
29 However, the respondent was not necessarily to receive the same punishment as would have been appropriate if he had himself personally performed all of those acts. In each case it depends on the circumstances whether a person who is criminally liable for an act as a principal in the second degree or as an accessory should be regarded as equally culpable, less culpable or even more culpable than the person who actually performed the criminal act. See the discussion by the High Court in GAS v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198 especially at 209 (23). (bold not in original) 

17This passage was also cited with approval in R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [162]. With respect to the identification of the role played by each participant in a joint criminal enterprise, Spigelman CJ said (Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ agreeing) at [161] :- 

It may be the case that the particular role of a person engaged in a joint criminal enterprise does not always need to be identified with ""precision"", because of the responsibility each participant in such a joint enterprise must bear for the acts of any other participant in carrying out that enterprise . Nevertheless, it is always relevant to refer to the particular conduct of each such participant with a view to identifying the level of culpability for which each must be sentenced. (See, eg, Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609; R v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242 at 254-259; R v Spathis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [193]-[197]. See generally A Dyer and H Donnelly, ""Sentencing in Complicity Cases - Part 1: Joint Criminal Enterprise"", Sentencing Trends and Issues , No 38, Judicial Commission of New South Wales, June 2009.) (bold not in original) 

18More recently, in R v Sukkar [2011] NSWCCA 140, Davies J summarised the position thus at [36] :- 

To the extent that the grounds do not raise the parity principle they seem only to deal with the proper approach to sentencing for a joint criminal enterprise particularly where the co-offenders have different roles in the enterprise. Although the starting point is that the offenders were parties to the same joint criminal enterprise, and that should not be lost sight of, ( Johnson v R; Moody v R at [4]), and that one should not identify the differences in the roles with any precision ( R v Hoschke [2001] NSWCCA 317 at [18], R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [161], Johnson v R; Moody v R at [11]), it is always relevant to refer to the particular conduct of each such participant with a view to identifying the level of culpability for which each must be sentenced ( R v JW at [161], and see Johnson v R; Moody v R at [4] and [94], Regina v Darwiche & Ors [2006] NSWSC 1167 at [74], Regina v Rick Barry Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [72] and [74]). (bold not in original) 

19What emerges from these statements of sentencing principle is that the participants in a joint criminal enterprise are equally responsible or liable for all the acts in the course of carrying out the enterprise, by whomsoever they are committed, yet a particular participant's level of culpability stands to be assessed by reference to his/her particular conduct. 

20Such an approach is consonant with the distinction in law between an offender's responsibility for criminal conduct and his/her culpability. They are relevant at different stages of the criminal process. 

21Criminal responsibility, and therefore liability to punishment, attaches to a person who voluntarily and intentionally performs those acts constituting an offence. ""The concurrence of will and physical act and the concurrence of intent and physical act suffices to attract criminal liability."" : R v O'Connor [1980] HCA 17 at [20] ; 146 CLR 64 at 72, per Barwick CJ. 

22Culpability, on the other hand, is concerned with the assessment of an offender's moral responsibility for the offence. As such, it assumes liability for the offence and focuses upon aspects of the offender's conduct and his/her subjective circumstances in order to determine the appropriate degree of punishment : R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19 ; R v Henry & Ors. [1999] NSWCCA 111 at [254] ; 46 NSWLR 346 ; 106 A Crim R 149. 

23Turning then to Howie J's remarks on sentence, the reference to the offenders' equal responsibility for the death of the deceased did no more than reflect their joint participation in an agreement to inflict serious physical injury that resulted in the victim's death. The findings of fact made by his Honour that attribute to the applicant the stomping injuries to the head of the deceased are not disputed by the applicant. His Honour then implicitly acknowledges that some other injuries to the face and head of the deceased were probably jointly inflicted with LR. 

24These findings were consistent with the agreed statement of facts that included a summary of the post mortem report to the effect that there were more than five visible shoe imprints to the deceased's head, including to the scalp, the right side of the face and left upper neck. These shoe imprints were consistent with the tread pattern of shoes worn by the applicant. There were also other injuries to the face, including the fracture of the jaw and extensive bruising. The findings were also not inconsistent with the unchallenged evidence of LR that he had kicked the deceased once to the face. 

25In short, a proper reading of the remarks on sentence make it abundantly clear that this applicant was indeed more culpable than LR. That greater culpability arose from his infliction of more significant violence upon the deceased than LR, a conclusion that followed from the forensic evidence and from the absence of any evidence before the judge capable of differentiating the applicant's role in the commission of the offence from that suggested by the agreed statement of facts. 

26In my view, there is no substance to this ground. The applicant's sentence does not engage the parity principle because the judge made legitimate findings of fact that gave rise to different degrees of culpability. In these circumstances, the notion of equal justice was not violated : Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26 ; 189 CLR 295. 

27Following the hearing of the appeal, the applicant requested that the Court not deliver judgment until after the parties had been given the opportunity to file additional submissions addressing the impact, if any, of the High Court's publication of its reasons in Green v The Queen ; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49. The High Court's reasons were handed down on 6 December 2011 and supplementary submissions were received on 13 and 14 December 2011. 

28The majority of the High Court in Green and Quinn discussed the exercise of the residual discretion on a Crown appeal not to intervene, even where the sentence in question might be considered erroneously lenient. It was accepted that the application of the parity principle in severity appeals is different from its application in Crown appeals (at [34]). In the course of the majority judgment (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) it was noted at [32] that : 

A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. 

29The qualitative and discretionary judgments made by the primary judge in this case were entirely justified. The applicant has not demonstrated any error in that respect. The legitimate distinction drawn between the applicant and LR justified a difference of 3 years in the notional starting point. 

Ground 2 : Denial of Procedural Fairness 

30The applicant's complaint on this ground is that the allocation of a 15% discount for his plea of guilty constituted a denial of procedural fairness, in that the judge had previously indicated during the sentencing proceedings that a discount of 20% would be applied. Further, it is said that the applicant had relied on that legitimate expectation and had not been given an opportunity to make submissions in opposition to any lower discount. In order to deal with this ground, it is necessary to place the judge's remarks in their proper context. 

31During the sentencing proceedings and following a query of the applicant's then counsel whether the applicant should receive any less or more than the 20% discount given to LR, the applicant's counsel said :- 

Your Honour, I would not be arguing with the same discount. 

32The judge then referred to the delay in the entry of the applicant's plea while potential defences were explored and said :- 

The simple fact is that you get your discount principally upon when the plea is given and the complexity or otherwise of the case is a different question, but this wasn't a complex case. There might have been a few witnesses called. Anyway, unless the Crown says otherwise , it seems to me a discount of 20% is appropriate. 

33After a further brief exchange, his Honour repeated :- 

As I say, I am not giving him any more than 20%. Unless the Crown wants to suggest otherwise , that is what I'll give him. 

34The italicised words in the passages set out above indicate that his Honour's view regarding the level of the discount was conditional upon the Crown's submissions on that subject. Shortly thereafter, the Crown Prosecutor said ""I would have submitted it be lower than that but I won't say anything more than that."" The following exchange occurred :- 

HH : Is there much difference between him and the co-offender in that regard ? 

Crown : I believe there is, your Honour, the co-offender gave evidence. 

HH : As to a plea of guilty? No? 

Crown : The plea of guilty of the co-offender was much earlier. It was entered in the Children's Court. 

HH : When was his [the applicant's] ? On the arraignment date in this court ? 

Crown : Yes. 

35The applicant's counsel made submissions in reply but did not further address the level of the discount. To the extent that the applicant now relies upon Trujillo-Mesa v R [2010] NSWCCA 201, the applicant did in fact have the opportunity to make further submissions in response to the Crown's submissions. The possibility that his Honour would discount the applicant's sentence by less than 20% was made overt during the above exchanges. 

36During the remarks on sentence, his Honour said :- 

The offender did not plead guilty until his arraignment in the Supreme Court. I was told that this was because the issue of intoxication had to be considered. That might be so but the utilitarian value of the pleas was delayed. Although I indicated at the hearing that I thought a discount of 20 per cent would be appropriate, on further reflection that would be unjustified and unfair to the co-offender who pleaded guilty in the Children's Court. I believe the Crown was correct in his submission that the discount should be less than I suggested. I am prepared to discount his sentence by 15%. 

37These remarks accurately record the discussions between the bench and counsel. They also expose his Honour's reasons for allowing the discount that he did. A discount of 15% is generally the most that could be expected on arraignment in this Court : R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102. 

38This ground also fails. 

39The orders I propose are :- 

(1)Leave to appeal granted. 

(2)Appeal dismissed. 

40HARRISON J : I agree with Latham J.

		27 March 2012",2012-03-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708514,Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : The issue raised by this application for leave to appeal falls within a small compass. 

2On 18 February 2011 the applicant was sentenced by Berman DCJ in the District Court for three sexual assaults upon a young girl, committed some 30 years earlier. The precise dates of the offences were not clearly established by the evidence because the complainant was 10 years or younger at the time of the first offence. However, the end of the period of offending appears to have been May 1981, when the complainant was 11 years of age. 

3The complainant did not go to the police until 2009. The charges on the indictment, however, alleged offences against the law as it stood up to May 1981, under s 76 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), since repealed. Each charge was of assault involving an act of indecency upon a person under 16 years of age. The maximum penalty for the offence at that time was six years imprisonment. 

4It will be necessary to address the specific sentences in due course. Relevantly in respect of the appeal, the effect of the sentencing was to impose an overall period of three years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years. Those periods were to date from 18 February 2011, being the date of sentencing. 

5The ground of the proposed appeal is that although the sentencing judge sought to apply sentencing practices as they operated at the time of the offences, the non-parole period failed in that respect as at that time a relevant non-parole period would have been between one-third and one-half of the overall sentence period. 

6The correct approach, in terms of principle, was established by this Court in R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368. The Court adopted the principle identified by Mason CJ and McHugh J in Radenkovic v The Queen [1990] HCA 54; 170 CLR 623 at 632: 

""In the context of an appeal against sentence, when a court of criminal appeal is called upon to resentence because it has quashed the sentence initially imposed, considerations of justice and equity ordinarily require that the convicted person be re-sentenced according to the law as it stood at the time when he was initially sentenced, particularly when that law was more favourable to him than the law as it existed at the hearing of the appeal. The convicted person had an entitlement when he was sentenced by the sentencing judge to a sentence imposed in conformity with the requirements of the law as it then stood."" 

7Section 19 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act "") limits the effect of any increase in penalty to offences committed after its commencement. Consistently with that approach, the Court in MJR held that it should take into account sentencing practice as it was at the date of commission of the offence, when sentencing law and practice has changed adversely to an offender: at [27] and [31]. 

8In AJB v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32, Howie J (Adams and Price JJ agreeing) addressed a submission that it was necessary to take into account the fact that, in 1982, being the end of the period of offending in that case, remissions were available to reduce sentences imposed by the courts. Howie J stated at [31]: 

""There are many cases that indicate how the remission system operated and it is fair to say that, had the applicant been sentenced in 1982, he would, in all probability if not certainty, have received the benefit of a reduction of one third of his sentence. At this time remissions only applied to the head sentence and not to the non-parole period; see generally R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112; 46 A Crim R 340 as to the history and application of remissions. But I do not believe that it is appropriate for this Court to try to replicate, not only the sentencing practices of 1982, but also executive practices of that time in respect to the treatment of prisoners."" 

9Howie J noted that in 1982 ""a non-parole period was fixed at somewhere between a third and a half of the term of the sentence"": at [39]; see also Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263 at [35] (Fullerton J, Bell JA and Latham J agreeing); Mottram v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 210 at [41] (Hoeben J, Macfarlan JA and Grove J agreeing) and PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84 at [64] (RS Hulme J). 

10The remission system was abolished with reforms described as reflecting ""truth-in-sentencing"", effected by the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW), which commenced on 25 September 1989. 

11The remission system operated not pursuant to the general law, or executive act (although there were areas of discretion) but pursuant to regulations made under the Prisons Act 1952 (NSW) and, at the relevant time, the Prisons Regulation 1968 (NSW). The entitlement to ""ordinary"" remissions varied depending upon whether the offender had previously served a period of imprisonment of three months or more. If so, he or she was entitled to remission of one-quarter of the sentence period; if not, the entitlement to remission was one-third of the sentence period. (The relevant provisions are conveniently found in Smith v Corrective Services Commission (NSW) [1980] 2 NSWLR 171 at 183-185, in the judgment of Hope JA; see also Smith v Corrective Services Commission (NSW) [1980] HCA 49; 147 CLR 134 and Green v Corrective Services Commission (NSW) [1982] 1 NSWLR 327.) 

12As explained by Gleeson CJ, Hunt and Loveday JJ in Maclay , it was established principle that the sentencing judge should not increase the sentence to counteract the effect of anticipated remissions on the period to be served. However, that did not mean that the court ignored the anticipated remissions. With the introduction of the parole system pursuant to the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 (NSW), it became necessary for the sentencing judge to take account of the likely diminution on account of remissions in order to avoid ""the absurd result that a prisoner would be, as a result of the remissions system, released before the expiration of the non-parole period specified by the sentencing judge, with the result that the non-parole period would be rendered nugatory"": Maclay at 117G; Reg v Furey [1971] 2 NSWLR 262 at 267. 

13There might be a nice question as to whether it would now be necessary to consider the sentencing practices at the date of the offending, or as at the date of likely sentencing. With the commencement of the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (NSW), the absurdity which had previously existed was removed by providing for remissions to apply to the non-parole period. The result was, again in the words of the Court in Maclay, that ""all marched precisely in step in a proportionate sense"": at 118G. However, the courts held that ""neither in relation to head sentences nor in relation to non-parole periods were sentencing judges to increase terms to negative the effect of remissions that would be applied to them"": Maclay at 120D. 

14Applying the law, rather than executive practice, a sentencing court, whether in 1981 or 1984, would have fixed a non-parole period on the assumption that the overall ""sentence period"" would be reduced not only by one-third, on account of ordinary remissions, but also for ""earned"" remissions and, in all probability, other remissions which might accrue from time to time, such as ""special strike remissions"", designed to recognise the increased harshness of imprisonment during periods of industrial action by prison officers, which were not uncommon. 

15By way of example, the offender in Smith's case, who was serving an overall period of 12 years on account of five cases of rape, and was not a first offender, received a non-parole period of seven years, being 58% of the sentence period. Because, in the present case, a sentencing judge would have expected the applicant's sentence period to be reduced by more than one-third, it is likely that the non-parole period would have been less than 50% of the sentence period. 

16The sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period which was two-thirds of the sentence period. Because that would not have accorded with sentencing practice at the time of the offending, his Honour erred. In accordance with the practice identified by Howie J in AJB , the non-parole period would have been between 12 and 18 months in the case of a first offender. (The fact that, if sentenced after the commencement of the Probation and Parole Act 1983 , that period would have been reduced on account of remissions, would have properly been ignored.) 

17The remaining question is whether this Court should intervene on the basis that some other sentence is ""warranted in law and should have been passed"", for the purposes of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 

18In the course of argument, the Court's attention was directed to Mottram , where a similar error to that identified in the present case had been made in fixing the non-parole period, but the Court did not intervene. In that case the applicant had obtained the benefit of total concurrency in respect of six sentences, where at least in relation to two particular sentences involving a different victim at a later point in time, some degree of accumulation was required: at [47]. Hoeben J concluded that a ""proper application of the principles of proportionality and totality to the offending conduct in this case, even allowing for the lower maximum sentences applying during the 1970s and 1980s, would have inevitably resulted in sentences greater than those passed by his Honour"": at [49]. However, that passage demonstrates why, on its facts, Mottram was distinguishable from the present case. Not only was there no challenge by the Director to the overall sentence period in this case, but there was also no contention that it should have been treated as manifestly inadequate for the purpose of declining to intervene pursuant to s 6(3). The respondent's contention that no other sentence was warranted in law had regard only to the non-parole period. 

19Once the overall sentence period is accepted, and the relevant proportion for the non-parole period is identified in accordance with sentencing practice at the time of the offending, it is necessary to intervene to vary the non-parole period. The phrase ""warranted in law"" requires that ""the entire body of legal rules that inform the exercise of a sentencing discretion, ie both statutory requirements and sentencing principles developed at common law"" be applied: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at [18] (Spigelman CJ, Latham J agreeing). Critically, in determining the non-parole period, that must require application of the principles applicable at the time of offending, as discussed above. It follows that the non-parole period fixed by the sentencing judge was not that which was warranted by law. 

20The respondent raised a separate contention, based on the structure of the sentences imposed by the District Court. Thus, on each of the second and third counts, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of one year, with the first term (count 2) to commence on the date of sentencing, namely 18 February 2011, and the second (count 3) to commence six months later, on 18 August 2011. Thus, the second fixed term would expire on 17 August 2012. As a result, 18 months of the period of mandatory custody was to be attributed to two fixed term sentences. The third sentence (count 1) involved a non-parole period of one year, to commence on 18 February 2012 and expire on 17 February 2013. In the result, the actual non-parole period was 50% of the sentence imposed on count 1. However, it constituted only six months of the two year period of mandatory custody. The submissions of the respondent must be accepted in part: if the period of mandatory custody is to be reduced to less than 50% of the total sentence period, it will be necessary to interfere with at least the fixed term imposed in respect of count 3. 

21The respondent's submission otherwise reveals a further error on the part of the sentencing judge. Pursuant to the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 (NSW), as in force in 1982, a non-parole period was to be fixed in respect of the period of imprisonment being served by the offender at the date of sentencing, which might include an accumulation of earlier sentences and new sentences. The period was not fixed in respect of a specific sentence. Accordingly, the correct course in the present case, if dealt with in 1982, would have been to fix the various sentences of imprisonment imposed for the three counts and then specify a non-parole period which would commence on the date of imprisonment and continue regardless of the expiration of a particular fixed term sentence. The practical difficulty which is then apparent is that the sentence being imposed in 2011 is imposed in accordance with the powers conferred by the Sentencing Procedure Act . At the time of sentencing, the Act did not permit an aggregate non-parole period for all offences. 

22Since 14 March 2011, a court sentencing an offender for more than one offence may impose ""an aggregate sentence of imprisonment"": Sentencing Procedure Act , s 53A(1). Although that power was not available to the sentencing judge, it is available to this Court for the purpose of re-sentencing the applicant. In exercising that power, the Court may set one non-parole period for all the offences to which the sentence relates after setting the term of the sentence: s 44(2A). The requirement not to set a balance of term exceeding one-third of the non-parole period, absent a finding of special circumstances, applies in relation to the aggregate sentence: s 44(2B). It is not necessary to indicate what the non-parole period would have been for each separate offence had separate sentences been imposed (s 44(2C)) but the Court is required to indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed: s 53A(2). 

23The appropriate course is for the Court to set aside each of the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge and, in place of those sentences, impose an aggregate sentence of three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 months. 

24In taking that step, the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge should be accepted as appropriate, for the reasons he gave. Further, the sentences which he imposed in relation to counts 2 and 3, being fixed terms of one year each to commence on 18 February 2011 and 18 August 2011 respectively are the sentences which would have been imposed if an aggregate sentence had not been imposed. In relation to count 1, the sentence of imprisonment which would otherwise have been imposed is a sentence of two years imprisonment to date from 18 February 2012, without setting a non-parole period in relation to that sentence. The appropriate non-parole period in relation to the aggregate sentence is 16 months to date from 18 February 2011. 

25The Court should make the following orders: 

(1) Grant leave to appeal and set aside the sentences imposed by Berman DCJ on 18 February 2011. 

(2) Sentence the applicant in relation to the offences to which he pleaded guilty to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 3 years, comprising - 

(a) a non-parole period of 16 months to date from 18 February 2011 and to expire on 17 June 2012, and 
(b) a balance of term of 20 months, commencing on 18 June 2012 and expiring on 17 February 2014. 

(3) The Court directs the release of the applicant on parole on 17 June 2012. 

26RS HULME J : I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA and with his Honour's reasons. 

27I acknowledge to having had some reservations about the result, proceeding as it does from an assumption that the overall sentence was appropriate. That sentence was, as Basten JA has observed, not challenged by the Crown. 

28However, it must be accepted that the penalties provided by Parliament at the time of the Applicant's offending and which the Courts were obliged to follow were very much lighter than now and there are cases which support the view that a total of three years was within the proper exercise of Berman DCJ's sentencing discretion - see AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; (2007) 169 A Crim R 32; Bradbery v R [2008] NSWCCA 93; (2008) 184 A Crim R 483; GRD v R [2009] NSWCCA 149. Arguably, some of the cases on s 61E referred to in the table attached to my reasons in PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84 lead to the same conclusion. 

29SCHMIDT J : I agree with both Basten JA and RS Hulme J.

2708515,"Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Coffs Harbour Hardwoods Sales Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 52","EX TEMPORE Judgment 


1The defendant, Coffs Harbour Hardwood Sales Pty Limited, pleads guilty to one offence against s 118A(2)(a) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 in that on or about 3 August 2010 it picked twenty-one plants of a threatened species, namely, acacia chrysotricha - common name Newry Golden Wattle - at or near Urunga in the State of New South Wales. 

2The defendant also pleads guilty to an offence against s 156A(1)(b) of the same Act in that between about 3 August 2010 and 17 August 2010 inclusive it damaged vegetation on or in land reserved under the Act or acquired under Part 11 of the Act. 

3The maximum penalty available for an offence against s 118A(2)(a) is $220,000 plus $1,100 for each plant affected, which in this case amounts to $451,000. The maximum penalty for an offence against s 156A(1)(b) of the Act is $1.1 million. 

4The parties have helpfully and sensibly agreed on a statement of facts to which I now refer. The land on which the offence occurred is the Jaaningga Nature Reserve which covers an area of about 975 hectares of entirely forested land and is situated about twelve kilometres west of Urunga. The reason that the reserve was created was to protect a rare wattle which has the common name Newry Golden Wattle. Prior to being made a nature reserve, the reserve had been part of the Newry State Forest. The general purpose of reserving land as a nature reserve is set out in s 30J of the Act and it includes protecting areas containing unique species. 

5The Newry Golden Wattle is classified as endangered under schedule 1 of the Threatened Species (Conservation) Act 1995 and is found in and near the reserve. The principal threats to the survival of the wattle in nature as nominated by the Scientific Committee are logging activities and weed invasion. The population of wattle in and near the reserve is estimated to be at least 14,000 plants. 

6The reserve may be approached by a number of roads including Basin Road, which enters the reserve in the northeast, traverses the reserve and exits in the northwest. On Basin Road, on the left shoulder when entering the reserve from the northeast, there is a large National Parks and Wildlife sign which says ""Jaaningga Nature Reserve."" The sign is not however on the boundary of the reserve but is approximately 100 metres inside the boundary. 

7The defendant company is one of a group of companies that produces hardwood flooring, electricity poles and other timber products for building. It has a logging team that sources timber from a variety of locations in the surrounding region, including from private property. The directors of the company in August 2010 were Mr Gary Robert McCarthy and Mr Henry David McCarthy. Mr Bill McCarthy is a director of associated companies within the group and describes himself as the procurement manager for the defendant company. At the relevant time the defendant employed Mr Bob Hall as a bush boss who directed logging operations on its behalf. 

8Mr Mark Grebert owns a property with the street address 122 Basin Road via Urunga. It abuts the reserve which lies to its south. Mr Claude Bambini owns the neighbouring property to the west of the Grebert property. This land also shares its southern boundary with the reserve. 

9A private native forestry property vegetation plan exists in relation to Mr Grebert's property which allows for some clearing of the native vegetation on that property. Mr Grebert came to an agreement with the defendant that it would selectively log part of his property. Mr Hall and Mr Bill McCarthy did a prelogging inspection before work began. This was in late July 2010. Mr Grebert has said that he told Mr Hall and Mr McCarthy that there was a boundary with the reserve to the south of his property. Mr Grebert showed the private native forestry property vegetation plan to Mr Hall and Mr McCarthy which shows the boundary of the property, but it does not show that the neighbouring area to the south is nature reserve. 

10The logging began on or about 3 August 2010. There was no suitable flat area on Mr Grebert's property to pile the logs so a paddock on Mr Bambini's property was chosen as the log dump and loading area, and Mr Grebert obtained permission from Mr Bambini to use his paddock for that purpose. The trucks had to have access to the log dump and the most obvious access was from Basin Road. 

11Before the logging operation began, Mr Hall together with employees Mr Wall and Mr Hicks looked at maps showing property boundaries, house locations, gullies and streams. Although the defendant company was aware that there was a public land tenure of some sort on the other side of Mr Grebert's property, Mr McCarthy neither made any enquiries himself nor instructed any of his staff to do so. 

12The company did not properly identify the land boundaries of the Grebert property before logging operations began and it was approximately one week into the operation before the property boundary was properly marked. Without having first made any attempt to formally locate the boundary, Mr Hall found a blazed tree and nearby surveyor's peg near Basin Road at a point where he thought the south-eastern corner of the Grebert property was. In an attempt to find the southern boundary of the Grebert property, Mr Hall drove a bulldozer westward off Basin Road from a point close to where he identified the tree blaze and surveyor's peg. At this time Mr Hall was driving within the reserve, albeit that he did not know that he was doing so. This track has been referred to in the evidence as track B. 

13In driving the bulldozer along this track, Mr Hall scraped a new trail, uprooted vegetation and soil which was in his path, and pushed it into piles beside the track. The track had been taken back to bare earth. Before the passage of this bulldozer there was no visible trail through this section of the reserve. 

14Mr Hall then drove the bulldozer south through the reserve, up a ridge line from the proposed log dump site on Mr Bambini's land to Basin Road. Again Mr Hall says that he did not know the land was a reserve. The length of this trail is approximately 700 metres and is referred to as track A in the evidence. The purpose of this work was to create a log haulage route suitable for semi-trailers. The route was taken along an old fire trail that appears not to have been used for over ten years and was regrowing with shrubs, small trees and grass prior to the clearing. Again it was taken back to bare earth. 

15Along the way, Mr Hall turned left and drove the bulldozer to the east off track A, downhill approximately sixty metres into uncleared natural bush in order to try to find the boundary. In doing so he made a short side trail scraped to bare earth. This is referred to as track C in the evidence. Mr Hall also cleared areas to the side of track A which were used as car parks and passing bays. In addition there were approximately eighteen smaller areas to the side of track A which were cleared to accommodate the piles of vegetation and topsoil which had been removed to clear and form track A. 

16From 3 August 2010 until 16 August 2010 there were more than twenty logging truck movements and other traffic using track A. Each truck and vehicle movement southward into the reserve along Basin Road over this time passed the large Jaaningga Nature Reserve sign with the National Parks and Wildlife Service logo upon it that identified the reserve. During the course of the logging operation both Mr Hall and Mr Wall became aware of the sign. 

17A proper attempt to establish the location of the southern boundary of the Grebert property was made about a week after the commencement of logging operations. During the course of the logging operation it became clear, at least to Mr Hall and Mr Wall, that tracks A, B and C were all in the reserve. No alternative means of removing the logs was attempted. In all approximately 4,000 square metres of the reserve, predominantly in the form of tracks, was cleared to bare earth by a bulldozer during this logging operation. No sediment controls had been put in place. In interview Mr Hall agreed with the proposition that given the nature of the topography it would have been usual practice to put in sedimentation controls. 

18I turn now to the evidence of environmental harm. It is agreed that twentyone of the wattles were impacted by the incident, thirteen killed and eight damaged comprising eleven mature and ten immature individuals. Those killed were mainly immature individuals. This represents loss and damage of approximately 0.15 per cent of the total current known population of the wattle. It is not known exactly how many wattles are within the reserve but it is likely to be approximately 1,000 of the total known population of about 14,000. 

19The potential for recruitment into the population of the wattle has been reduced due to the loss of reproductively mature individuals. The wattle first flowers and produces seed at five to six years with its seed production increasing with age. It may take ten to fifteen years to set sufficient seed into the soil seed pool so as to replace the seeding capacity of those plants lost during the incident. Due to the disturbance to vegetation there is also the potential for further weed spread into the reserve by exotic plants such as lantana and broadleafed paspalum. 

20There was an additional impact on thirty native plant species within the reserve as a result of the logging operation including damage, logging and death to many large trees including tallowwood, blackbutt, ironbark, forest oak, turpentine and white mahogany. Many additional species of smaller shrubs, forbs and native grasses also suffered damage or death within the reserve as a result of the bulldozer's passage. 

21A survey in September and November 2011 revealed that a total of seventyeight native species were regenerating at the sites originally surveyed. The plant which was regenerating most prolifically was the small native pastel flower with 360 plants, but the second and third most numerous were the weeds lantana and broad-leafed paspalum. 

22In addition to the environmental harm which I have described, I now turn to other sentencing and penalty considerations. Again the Court has been assisted by written submissions filed by both parties which have been supplemented by oral submissions. In turning to the question of penalty there are a number of important considerations. One of those considerations in considering the objective seriousness of the offence is the purpose for the establishment of nature reserves as expressed in the National Parks and Wildlife Act . That Act of course has as its objectives a number of matters including the conservation of nature, including but not limited to the conservation of habitat, ecosystems and ecosystem processes, and the biological diversity at the community, species and genetic levels. 

23The purpose of reserving land as nature reserves is to identify, protect and conserve areas containing outstanding, unique or representative ecosystems, species, communities or natural phenomena so as to enable those areas to be managed in accordance with sub-s (2): s30J(1). Subsection 30J(2) states: 

A nature reserve is to be managed in accordance with the following principles: 

(a) the conservation of biodiversity, the maintenance of ecosystem function, the protection of geological and geomorphological features and natural phenomena. 

24The fact that the wattle in this case is a threatened species also calls into consideration the Threatened Species (Conservation) Act 1995 and the objects of that Act, which are self-evidently to conserve biological diversity and promote ecologically sustainable development, and to prevent the extension and promote the recovery of threatened species, populations and ecological communities amongst other objects. 

25There are a number of considerations in sentencing which apply specifically to these offences as set out in sub-s 194(1) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act . It is necessary to consider each of those and then to consider the other matters required to be considered under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

26In considering the statutory considerations set out in s 194 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act, the first is the extent of harm caused or likely to be caused by the commission of the offences. It is accepted that in this case there are two offences to consider. I refer to the fact that the Newry Golden Wattle is an endangered species under the Threatened Species (Conservation) Act . In order to be listed under this category, the Scientific Committee must assess according to the criteria under that Act whether a species is facing a very high risk of extinction in New South Wales in the near future as determined in accordance with criteria prescribed by the regulations. 

27It is an agreed fact, as I have noted, that the offence will have a significant impact on the population of the wattle in the nature reserve. Though there is some sign of regeneration in some of the damaged plants, the damage is to at least seventeen plants, many of them mature trees, and it seems to be terminal. Again it is an agreed fact that it may take as long as ten to fifteen years to replace the lost seeding capacity and return to the status quo. The prosecutor's expert witness is of the opinion that the removal of 29 trees is significant, an opinion with which the defendant does not agree. Having regard to the number of trees in the reserve, I do not regard the impact as significant. I have referred to the fact that some 4,000 square metres within the nature reserve has been cleared right back to bare earth and some thirty native species, including some regarded as rare or threatened, were damaged or killed along with shrubs and native grasses. It is also agreed that it would have been the usual practice to have put in sedimentation controls to mitigate likely erosion and this was not done, with resultant potential for harm. The clearing allows for weed infestation in the cleared areas and, as I have noted, this has now occurred. 

28I accept, as the defendant points out, that the twenty-one wattles that were impacted by the incident represents loss and damage of approximately 0.15 per cent of the current known population of 14,000 approximately plants. The defendant also points out that the total cleared area of 4,000 square metres, predominantly tracks, represents 0.041 per cent of the reserve. 

29The next consideration under s 194 of the Act is the significance of the reserve land and the threatened species. The significance of the Newry Golden Wattle is of course largely established by status and an endangered rather than vulnerable species, and it is noted that there are very higher concerns in the structure of the Threatened Species (Conservation) Act. I accept the prosecutor's submission that the purpose of establishing a nature reserve places it in the upper levels of the hierarchy of reserved land. Such areas are especially given over to the protection of outstanding or unique species. 

30The next consideration under s 194 is the practical measures which may have been taken to prevent, control, abate or mitigate the harm. It is, as I noted, an agreed fact that the defendant could have properly established the boundary before doing any work on or adjacent to Mr Grebert's property. The defendant knew there was a boundary close to the logging area but did not try to establish where it was other than by the highly destructive means of driving a bulldozer along a path where it was thought to be. It is said that the defendant may not have logged Mr Grebert's property if there was no other way to cart the logs out; and if there was no alternative route other than through the reserve, the defendant may well have chosen not to do the work. 

31The next consideration under s 194 is the extent to which the person who committed the offence could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused by the commission of the offence. I note that it is not alleged that the defendant knew that the Newry Golden Wattle was in the reserve, but it is self-evident that driving a bulldozer through the bush would have damaged trees and soil. Much of the country through which Mr Hall drove was uncleared natural bush and the old logging trail was only part of the cleared area. In those circumstances I accept that the possibility of harm was more foreseeable. 

32The next consideration under the section is the extent to which the person who committed the offence had control over the causes which gave rise to the offence. Mr Hall, the bush boss, had worked for the defendant company for over twenty years, and I accept the submission that this bespeaks the level of trust and responsibility that the defendant placed in him. In addition, Mr Bill McCarthy, the procurement manager for the company, came to the site but gave no instructions which would have avoided the incident. I accept that the defendant had complete control over the causes giving rise to the offence. 

33The only other relevant consideration under s 194 is whether the offence was committed for commercial gain. In this respect it is self-evident that the offences were committed in the course of a commercial enterprise but not for commercial gain per se , that is, there was no specific proposal to log trees in the reserve. The offences occurred in the course of a commercial activity. 

34Then there are other considerations which bear on the question of sentencing and penalty. The fact that the Court may take other matters into account is expressly stated in s 194(2) of the Act. I accept the fact that although the defendant knew there was public land bordering Mr Grebert's property, it took no proper steps to establish where the boundary was or whose property it was. I accept the fact that the offence was committed negligently, which of itself increases the objective seriousness of the offence. Once the defendant knew where the property boundary was, it continued to use the logging trail that it had cleared, and in that sense it knew that it was in a nature reserve and its conduct thereafter was both wilful and deliberate. In taking the logs out, logging trucks must of necessity have driven past the National Parks and Wildlife sign on Basin Road. 

35The defendant points to a number of mitigating circumstances which I take into account. I have referred to the fact that I have accepted the submission that the offences were not committed for commercial gain but are properly to be regarded as offences in the course of a commercial activity. I accept the fact that, turning to the subject of circumstances of the defendant, it has engaged in the business of logging and production of wood products for over thirty-five years. It has fully co-operated with the prosecutor throughout the conduct of this matter in comprehensive records of interview, in the preparation and filing of an agreed statement of facts, and in the oral evidence of Mr Bill McCarthy, who gave evidence before me this morning and who expressly says that he is very sorry to have done this and that it was, as far as he was concerned, unintentional. 

36I accept that the defendant has expressed contrition and remorse as shown by Mr McCarthy's evidence, by its immediate and comprehensive assistance to the authorities, its guilty plea at the first available opportunity, and the presence of Mr Hall and Mr Bill McCarthy in the Court. 

37I also note that the defendant accepts the appropriateness of a remediation order which will be imposed, and I take into account in fixing the penalty the cost to the defendant of the remediation order which is said to be in the order of $12,500 to $17,500. 

38The purposes of sentencing under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are well-known. They are: 

(a) to ensure that the offender has been adequately punished for the offence; 
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences; 
(c) (not relevant); 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender; 
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions; 
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, and 
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 

39In this case the victim and the community are the threatened species involved and the community interest in preserving the threatened species and endangered species, and the purposes of having a nature reserve. 

40In the present case there is no need for any element of specific deterrent. However, the other considerations are relevant and I am prepared to take them into account. I take into account the fact that a fine must send a message to others in the timber industry that harming vegetation on reserved land without authorisation is just not acceptable. I also take into account the fact that the defendant does not have any record of previous convictions against this Act and, as I have said, that the defendant has agreed to both a remediation order and, in addition, a publication order. Moreover, the defendant also consents to an order to pay the prosecutor's costs in the agreed sum of $26,000. 

41In the present case the two offences arise out of the same course of conduct and there is a considerable overlap between them. In these circumstances the principle of totality applies. The principle of totality was usefully described by the president of the Court of Appeal, Kirby P, in Camilleri's Stock Feeds Pty Limited v Environmental Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683. In that case the president adopted what was said by Sir Laurence Street in an earlier case of R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 260: 

The principle of totality is a convenient phrase descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently, a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing judge will evaluate in a broad sense the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and having done so will determine what if any downward adjustment is necessary whether by telescoping or otherwise in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences. The effect of this practical consideration is always to produce an ultimate aggregate which is less than that which would be arrived at by a straightforward adding up of the terms appropriate for the offences if each were viewed alone. In carrying out this process of adjustment it is both inevitable as well as proper that the ultimate decision be arrived at in the light of the totality of the criminality involved in all the offences. 

42In considering the totality of the criminality involved in all of the offences I have been referred to a number of other cases, none of which have identical facts to those in the present case, but they do indicate a range of sentencing which has occurred in what might be called generally land clearing cases. It is necessary to have regard to these when imposing a penalty since the Court has to have regard to what is called the principle of even-handedness. In considering the other cases to which I have been referred, only three of them are cases involving offences against s 156A of the Act but, as I have said, the facts in each case are different. 

43Doing the best I can, I have come to a view that the totality of the criminality in both offences in this case warrants a penalty of $120,000 having regard to the maximum penalties, and I am prepared to reduce that in view of the mitigating factors to which I referred to $85,000. This therefore is the total penalty which will be apportioned between the two offences. 

44It is then appropriate that I make the following formal orders: 

1. In relation to matter 50716 of 2011: 


1.The Defendant is guilty of an offence against s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 as charged. 
2.The Defendant is fined a total of $45,000.00 
3.The Defendant must pay the Prosecutor's costs in the agreed sum of $26,000.00. 
4.Within 28 days of these orders, the Defendant is to submit for approval to the Coffs Coast Area Manager of the National Parks and Wildlife Service a design for strainer posts and a gate to be erected at the junction of Basin Road and Track A in the plan in the agreed statement of facts with a sign saying ""Trail closed for Rehabilitation"". 
5.Within 28 days of such approval, the strainer posts and gate are to be erected. 
6.Within 28 days of these orders, the Defendant is to submit for approval to the Coffs Coast Area Manager of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, a five year plan for weed control in areas within Jaaningga Nature Reserve cleared by the Defendant to be undertaken by suitably qualified bush regenerators registered with the Australian Association of Bush Regenerators. This plan is to include a condition that a report on the weed control be provided to the Coffs Coast Area Manager of the National Parks and Wildlife Service ever 1 July and 1 February until 1 February 2017. 
7.Within 28 days of these orders, the Defendant is to submit for approval to the Coffs Coast Area Manager of the National Parks and Wildlife Service a plan by a suitably qualified expert for the mitigation and/or prevention of soil erosion in Jaaningga Nature Reserve caused by the Defendant's clearing. 
8.Within 90 days of such approval, the works specified in the plan must be carried out. 
9.A Publication Order in the form of Annexure A to these orders be placed in the Saturday edition of the Coffs Harbour Advocate and the Bellinger Courier Sun within 28 days of these orders and the Prosecutor be notified of the publication within 28 days of such publication. 

45In relation to matter 50718 of 2011: 

1. The Defendant is guilty of an offence against s 156(A)(1)(b) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 as charged. 
2. The Defendant is fined $40,000.00. 

46The exhibits may be returned. 

47I thank both counsel and solicitor for their assistance in this case.

PUBLICATION ORDER COFFS HARBOUR HARDWOODS SALES PTY LIMITED CONVICTED OVER ILLEGAL WORKS IN NATURE RESERVE 
On 6 March 2012 Coffs Harbour Hardwoods Sales Pty Limited (CHH) was convicted in the Land and Environment Court of two offences against the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 . In August 2010, as part of a legitimate logging operation on a neighbouring property, a CHH employee drove a bulldozer through Jaaningga Nature Reserve near Urunga. The apparent purpose was to locate the boundary of the area to be logged and to create a trail through the Nature Reserve to remove the logs. While driving the bulldozer through the Nature Reserve, over 1 kilometre of illegal track was created and 21 Newry Golden Wattles ( Acacia chrysotricha ), an endangered species listed under Schedule 1 of the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act , were damaged or killed along with a number of other protected native trees and plants in the Reserve, leading to approximately 4,000 square metres of the Nature Reserve being cleared to bare earth. CHH pleaded guilty and was fined $85,000.00 with $26,000.00 costs and ordered to finance restoration and weed control works within the damaged area of the Nature Reserve. 
Coffs Harbour Hardwoods Sales Pty Limited was prosecuted by the Office of Environment and Heritage and was ordered by the Land and Environment Court to place this notice at CHH's expense.

2708538,R v DEBS [2012] NSWSC 119,"sentence 

1On 12 December 2011, Mr Debs was convicted by a jury of having, on 22 April 1995 at Minchinbury, murdered Donna Hicks. He now stands to be sentenced. I instruct myself that any conclusions at which I arrive in the process must be consistent with the verdict of the jury, that insofar as I make other findings adverse to the Prisoner and not necessarily implicit in the verdict, I must be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt, but that I am only required to be satisfied of matters in mitigation on the balance of probabilities. 

2I also wish to make clear that I am sentencing the Prisoner for the murder of Ms Hicks. Although I will in the course of these reasons refer to other of his offending, I take that into account not to punish him for it but solely insofar as it bears on issues relevant to a determination of the appropriate sentence for the death of Ms Hicks. 

3In the late evening of 21 April 1995, Ms Hicks was working on the Great Western Highway at Minchinbury as a prostitute. At about 8.30 am on the next morning, her naked body was found at the southern end of Archbold Road, Minchinbury in long grass between the entrances to two properties with boundaries to Archbold Road. 

4Blood on one of the entrance driveways and flattening of the grass between there and where the body was found indicated the body had been dragged to its final resting place. The deceased's panties were on the driveway but there were no other of her clothes in the vicinity. 

5In the days surrounding Ms Hicks' death, the Prisoner, who lived in Victoria, was shown to have been present in suburbs surrounding Minchinbury. He was then the owner of a dark blue Holden Rodeo utility which had four doors and a canopy over the open area at the rear. The vehicle's wheels were painted silver or some similar colour. 

6A witness, Mr Zanker, who had been with the deceased on the highway gave evidence of the deceased having been picked up late on the night of 21 April in a vehicle his description of which in many respects closely matched that of the Prisoner's vehicle. The evidence suggested that the deceased was not seen alive again. 

7Examination of the genital and perineal areas of the deceased revealed no injuries. The cause of death was a wound from a ""fairly large cartridge"" or, differently expressed, ""a medium to large calibre bullet"" which had entered the deceased's lower left cheek and exited at the top of her scalp. Powder tattooing on the deceased's face indicated that the firearm from which the bullet came was a short distance, say 15 to 50 centimetres, from the deceased's skin at the time the bullet was discharged. There was also powder tattooing to the deceased's right forearm, suggesting that this was near her face at the time of discharge. 

8Dr Little, the pathologist who examined the deceased, observed a number of other bruises and abrasions on the body but none were large or appeared to be of significance. Dr Little took a rectal swab before the body was removed from Archbold Road and during the post-mortem also took high vaginal, low vaginal and vulval swabs. In due course, these swabs were combined and it will be convenient to refer to them collectively as ""vaginal swabs"". 

9The vaginal and rectal swabs were examined. Both contained DNA consistent with that of the Prisoner. The chance of finding an unrelated person in the general population with the same DNA profile was fewer than one in 10 billion. 

10The deceased's panties were also examined. No DNA other than that of Ms Hicks was found on them. 

11In June 1997, the Prisoner resided at Narre Warren, in Victoria. On 17 June 1997, his credit card was used at a service station near his residence. 

12At about 11.30 am that day, a woman walking her dog saw a large pool of blood adjacent to a track between Burton Road and Emerald-Beaconsfield Road, Upper Beaconsfield, a location close to Narre Warren. On the following day, two other women also observed the pool of blood and police were called. Their inspection of the scene revealed a body which turned out to be that of Ms Kristy Harty lying a little distance off the track. Flattening of grass and other signs indicated that this body had been dragged from the vicinity of the track to where it was found. The track was one which could be traversed by a vehicle albeit possibly with difficulty or a little care. Ms Harty was clothed but her panties were entwined with a stick around her feet. Prior to her death, Ms Harty worked as a street prostitute. 

13Inspection of her body and a bullet found at the scene revealed that she had been shot with a .357 magnum calibre bullet that entered the left side of the top of her head and exited on the right side of her jaw. The exit injury was described by Dr Burke, a Victorian pathologist, as ""a shored exit injury"" one which suggested that a firm object was against Ms Harty's right jaw at the time of the gunshot discharge. Dr Burke opined that, taking into account what was to be seen where Ms Harty's body was found, one reasonable possibility was that she was face down with the right side of her face against the earth when the gun was discharged. 

14Again, there was a deal of gunshot residue deposited adjacent to the entrance wound and both Dr Burke and a Victorian ballistics expert Mr Vincent expressed the view that this material indicated that the weapon was very close to the deceased's skin when fired. Mr Vincent said that the weapon used was a revolver and that a .357 magnum is a high powered cartridge. 

15The post-mortem of Ms Harty revealed no apparent injury to the upper thighs, external or internal genitalia or anal area. 

16High vaginal, low vaginal, rectal and perineal swabs were taken from Ms Harty's body and smears on microscope slides taken from those swabs. After the slides were submitted to the Victorian Police Forensic Science Centre, spermatozoa were detected on the high and low vaginal slides but not on the perineal or anal slides. In due course, the high and low vaginal swabs were pooled. DNA extracted from those swabs was the subject of further investigation and found to be consistent with that of the Prisoner. 

17All the area of Ms Harty's underpants was examined for seminal stains. Stains were found in two areas but there were none in the area of the crotch. Slides were prepared from these stained areas. On one of these spermatozoa was detected. Samples from each area were sent for DNA examination and DNA consistent with that of the Prisoner was found in one sample. 

18Again in the case of the DNA found in both the vaginal samples and the positive underpants sample on the one hand and that taken from the Prisoner on the other, the chance of finding an unrelated person in the general population with the same DNA profile was fewer that one in 10 billion. 

19There was evidence from a Dr O'Dell who, though not a gynaecologist, had extensive experience in gynaecological examinations, some as a forensic physician while employed by the Victorian Police Department of Forensic Medicine. Dr O'Dell said that after ejaculation during sexual intercourse, it is almost inevitable that some ejaculate will appear on the outside of the vagina and the absence of staining to the crotch areas of Ms Hicks' and Ms Harty's underpants was very suggestive that they were not worn in the usual position after intercourse. 

20In the above account, I have referred to evidence that was given in the Prisoner's trial. I add now that I accept all of that evidence. 

21In the Prisoner's trial for the murder of Ms Hicks, I allowed in over objection the evidence relating to the death of Ms Harty because the similarity in circumstances argued against mere coincidence and in favour of the view that the same person was responsible for both deaths. The jury was told that if they were to use the death of Ms Harty as arguing for the Prisoner's guilt they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he killed her. 

22Adopting the same standard, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Prisoner killed both women. Considered individually, the circumstances of each death including the presence of his DNA, argues strongly for that conclusion. The possibility that someone else may have happened upon one of the victims after the Prisoner had had intercourse with her is eliminated by the coincidences in the circumstances. Neither victim had the occasion or time to replace her panties to their normal position between having intercourse with the Prisoner and being shot. 

23There was no evidence suggestive of any motive that, even in the discrete area of human activity of murder, could be considered normal or rational. Ms Hicks' body displayed none of the signs commonly found when a woman has resisted sexual intercourse. There were no signs of a struggle and it seems clear that the Prisoner had had a complete act of intercourse with her. 

24Considered in isolation, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the murder of Ms Hicks was carried out as an exercise of power or for some thrill or satisfaction derived from the act, or a combination of these factors. When one takes account of the circumstances of the later killing of Ms Harty, that conclusion becomes inescapable. 

25The Prisoner was born in July 1953. Prior to the death of Ms Hicks, he had a minor criminal record in New South Wales of assault, unseemly words, goods in custody and discharging a firearm in a public place. The last mentioned charge was dismissed under s.556A of the Crimes Act 1900 as it then was. The penalties imposed for the other offences were small. An Antecedents Report from Victoria tells a more serious tale. That report showed that in 1988 he was convicted of assault with a weapon and theft. In an appeal in 1989, the sentences imposed for those offences were varied so as to remove any custodial element. In 1991, he was again convicted of theft and in 1996 of theft from a motor vehicle and of reckless conduct creating a danger of serious injury. 

26However, those matters pale into insignificance in consequence of the fact that in late 2002, the Prisoner was convicted of having, in August 1998, murdered two police officers. The circumstances of that offence are described in the Remarks on Sentence of Cummins J, reported as DPP v Debs & Roberts [2003] VSC 30 and I should make brief reference to them. 

27A car, containing the Prisoner and a Mr Roberts had been stopped by Sergeant Silk and Senior Constable Miller. It was obvious that there was a risk, perhaps a likelihood, that those officers would search the Prisoner, Mr Roberts and their vehicle. Mr Roberts, without warning, shot Sergeant Silk at close range through the chest, causing him to fall to the ground. Constable Miller shot at Mr Roberts in defence of Sergeant Silk. I quote Cummins J's summary of what followed:- 

You, Mr Debs, immediately fired at Senior Constable Miller through the hatch window of your vehicle which you had re-entered to obtain your .357 Magnum handgun. You repeatedly fired at Senior Constable Miller, one shot mortally wounding him. In great pain, Senior Constable Miller managed to struggle away from the scene to seek help and for your apprehension. In order to avoid the risk of being shot or identified, you did not pursue him. Instead, you, Mr Debs, went up to the helpless and immobile Sergeant Silk who was lying on the grassy verge, shot him in the pelvis and then shot him in the head, the last shot killing him instantly. You executed him - to ensure he could not identify either of you. 

28For each of those murders, the Prisoner was sentenced to imprisonment for life, Cummins J declining to set a non-parole period. 

29In 2007, the Prisoner was convicted in Victoria of the murder of Ms Harty. On 22 June 2007, Kaye J imposed a further sentence of life imprisonment, also declining to fix a non-parole period - see R v Debs [2007] VSC 220. An application for leave to appeal against that sentence was dismissed - see R v Debs [2008] VSCA 240. 

30The timing of events and some evidence in the trial before me of DNA investigation would suggest that it was after the Prisoner's arrest for the murders of Sergeant Silk and Constable Miller that the police secured a sample of the Prisoner's DNA and that led to him being charged with the murder of Ms Harty and later with the murder of Ms Hicks. He was charged with Ms Hicks' murder on 9 November 2010. 

31Turning to the topic of subjective circumstances, such evidence as there was in this regard is to be found in the remarks on sentence of Cummins and Kaye JJ and in the Victorian Court of Appeal. It seems that the Prisoner was arrested in Victoria in July 2000. I infer he has been in custody ever since. The Prisoner was born in July 1953. He was married and has five adult children. He was a tiler by way of occupation. 

32Cummins J accepted that the Prisoner had had an unstable and difficult childhood, was of ordinary intelligence at best but did not suffer any psychiatric illness or psychological disorder. 

33There are a number of statutory provisions by which I must be guided or, at least, I must take into account. They include the following. 

34Pursuant to s 19A of the Crimes Act , the maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment. Such a sentence, if imposed, means precisely that, without the prospect of parole. Of course, a lesser sentence may be imposed - Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21(1). If a lesser sentence is imposed the Court must set a non-parole period unless it appears to the Court appropriate to decline to do so - Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, ss 44, 45. 

35Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets out the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence. They are:- 

(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 

(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 

(c) To protect the community from the offender, 

(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 

(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 

(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 

(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 

36Initially, the Crown relied upon s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . That section reproduces what was s 431B of the Crimes Act but that earlier provision was inserted only in 1996, ie, after the death of Ms Hicks. The Crown accepted that these provisions seemed to have no application. 

37Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act lists a large number of aggravating and mitigating factors and requires that, subject to a number of express qualifications within the section, where relevant and known, such factors be taken into account. (The section also refers to ""any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence"", but I have mentioned these.) In the circumstances here, the only aggravating factor of relevance is that Ms Hicks, because of her occupation, should be regarded as vulnerable. 

38However, there are a number of potentially mitigating factors to which I should direct attention. Summarised, they are whether the Prisoner is unlikely to re-offend, whether he has good prospects of rehabilitation and whether he has shown, in one or other of ways specified, remorse. 

39There is no positive evidence in the Prisoner's favour in respect of any of these matters. The lack of normal or rational motive I have found argues against a conclusion that he is unlikely to re-offend and the conclusion I have reached as to the motivation he did have argues in favour of the view that he is in fact likely to do so. These matters lead to a similar adverse result on the topic of rehabilitation. 

40The Prisoner's subsequent murder of Ms Harty, who the evidence indicates was most unlikely to have had a vehicle, leads to the conclusion that he was so untroubled by what he had done to Ms Hicks that he engineered a similar situation to arise - victim and offender in a relatively lonely area, intercourse, and him armed with a firearm. The conclusion that he had no remorse at killing Ms Hicks is unavoidable. 

41In dealing with these matters - unlikelihood of re-offending, rehabilitation and remorse - I have expressed myself without regard to the fact that, as they are matters of mitigation, the onus of establishing them lies on the Prisoner. He has failed to discharge that onus. 

42Before I proceed further, I should acknowledge that there was tendered during the sentence proceedings a Victim Impact Statement of Barbara Hicks, Ms Donna Hicks' mother and grandmother of Ms Hicks' three children. That statement, as do others like it, serves to bring home the loss and suffering which those close to victims of violent offences suffer. That said, I must approach the statement as dictated by R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. 

43Against the conclusions at which I have arrived, I turn to the question of the sentence to be imposed. In some respects there was nothing particularly remarkable about the murder of Ms Hicks. There was an intention to kill but many murders are committed in that situation. There was no more violence than commonly associated with murder by shooting. The victim was not someone whose murder was calculated to impose any special harm on the community, such as those persons whose death may attract a standard non-parole period of 25 years. I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing was premeditated. 

44On the other hand, the circumstances bespeak a cold-blooded execution and this of a woman with whom the Prisoner had just had intercourse. They demonstrate, particularly when combined with the circumstances of the death of Ms Harty, a complete - I emphasise that word - lack of humanity. That conclusion is reinforced if regard is had to the shooting of Sergeant Silk but I do not need to rely on that to reach the conclusion just expressed. 

45The lack of any normal or rational motive is also a feature that distinguishes the Prisoner's crime from nearly all other instances of murder. So does my conclusion that the murder of Ms Hicks was carried out as an exercise of power or for some thrill or satisfaction derived from the act or perhaps some combination of these factors. So far as the objective circumstances of the offence are concerned, there are no mitigating factors. 

46The Prisoner's actions lead inescapably to the conclusion that he is, and will remain, a danger to the community. Its only protection is to have him locked up for the rest of his life. There is no reasonable prospect of the Prisoner's rehabilitation. 

47That said, in Veen v R (No 2) [1987-1988] 164 CLR 465 at 473 the High Court laid down that while the protection of society is a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence, that object cannot justify the imposition of a sentence beyond what is appropriate to a crime. One might wonder whether the express reference in s 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to protecting the community from the offender as one identified purpose of sentencing provides grounds for thinking that what the High Court said is no longer law but the matter is not so clear that, sitting as a single judge, I should so decide. Accordingly, I proceed on the basis of what the High Court has said. 

48Veen v R (No 2) makes clear that a sentence must be proportional to the gravity of an offence, the maximum sentence prescribed being reserved for offences falling within a category of worst cases. Of course, subjective considerations may operate to effect some amelioration of this. 

49So where does the Prisoner's offence lie? Despite the features of the murder of Ms Hicks that are common to many murders, do the other matters to which I have referred raise his offence into a worst case category? Is the inhumanity and cold bloodedness of the Prisoner's actions done, not for any rational reason but, as I have found, as an exercise of power or for some thrill or satisfaction derived from the act or some combination of these factors sufficient to do so? 

50These last two questions must be answered in the affirmative. 

51I acknowledge that there must be an element of the subjective in that decision. However, at least arguing in favour of it are those cases, eg, R v Coulter [2005] NSWSC 101 where a similar conclusion has been reached when a significant factor leading to the conclusion would seem to have been the treatment of a victim's body after death. By definition, that treatment was not experienced by the victim. Its occurrence was not likely to lead to much repetition of such conduct by others. Rather, did the harm in such treatment lie in the departures from what are accepted to be proper standards of humanity, departures which were calculated to result in substantial weight being given to considerations of punishment and retribution. 

52Returning to the circumstances here, there is nothing in the circumstances of the offence or the Prisoner that argues for a lesser rather than a greater penalty other than that his conduct could have been worse. However, as Veen v R (No 2) makes clear, that is not enough. Ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness. 

53While recognising the criticisms that have been made of life sentences, I am nevertheless satisfied that that is the only appropriate sentence in this case. 

54I sentence you, Bendali Michael Debs, to imprisonment for life, your sentence to commence on 12 December 2011.

		01 March 2012",2012-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708539,R v Mohammed Fahda [2012] NSWSC 114,"remarks on sentence  1HIS HONOUR: On 13 September 2011 the offender was found guilty, and subsequently convicted, following a trial before a jury, of murdering Abdul Darwiche on 14 March 2009 at Bass Hill.  In sentencing the offender I am required to determine the facts relevant to the exercise of my sentencing discretion in a manner that is consistent with the jury verdict.  Where the facts are adverse to the offender they must be found beyond reasonable doubt.  Facts that favour the offender need only be established on the balance of probabilities.  The objective of my fact finding after trial is not to determine the basis of the jury's verdict, but to determine the facts that are both consistent with it and material to the sentence.  The incident  2There was little if any relevant dispute about the facts at the trial and the offender admitted at least the following matters.  At about 2.30pm on Saturday 14 March 2009 the victim Abdul Darwiche went to eat with his family at the Paradise Cuisine restaurant situated at a small shopping complex on the corner of the Hume Highway and Miller Road at Bass Hill. The complex included a United Petroleum service station.  He drove there in his green Mitsubishi Triton 4WD vehicle and parked outside the pharmacy.  Members of his family had arrived there earlier.  3Shortly after 3.00pm the offender drove his silver Honda CRV into the service station and parked it near some petrol bowsers.  He alighted and went into the shop to purchase some items.  He returned to his vehicle and moved it to another location directly outside a Subway restaurant at the side of the service station.  A short time after that the offender moved the vehicle to another location closer to the corner of the Hume Highway and Miller Road.  The offender had arranged to meet another person at the service station.  That person arrived driving a black Jeep.  4At about this time the deceased left the restaurant and walked to his vehicle.  Other members of his family also went to the vehicles in which they had travelled to the restaurant, which were parked in the car park.  The deceased was seated in his vehicle when the offender alighted from his vehicle and started walking in the direction of the deceased.  The deceased in turn left his vehicle and walked towards the offender.  The two men came together somewhere between the two vehicles.  There was a short conversation between them before they each returned to their respective vehicles.  5The offender proceeded to drive his vehicle forward towards the Miller Road exit of the service station.  At the same time the deceased reversed his vehicle out of its parked position and also drove towards the Miller Road exit.  As the vehicles approached the exit they stopped, so that the vehicle driven by the offender was positioned adjacent to the passenger side of the deceased's vehicle.  The offender alighted from his vehicle, walked to the passenger side of the deceased's vehicle, and produced a semi-automatic pistol.  He then fired several shots from that pistol through the passenger side of the deceased's vehicle, hitting the deceased seven times, predominantly on the left hand side of his body.   The deceased's vehicle then travelled from the service station on to Miller Road and across a median strip into a reserve where it collided with a tree.  The offender got back into his vehicle, turned right into Miller Road and drove away.  The deceased died at the scene as a result of the bullet wounds that he received.  Ballistics evidence established that the weapon that killed the deceased had been fired a total of 12 times.  Additional background  6The Fahda family is associated with the Razzak family.  Between 2001 and 2004 a number of murders and shootings took place involving members of the Razzak, Fahda and Darwiche families.  As a result of this conflict, a number of members of these families are either dead or in gaol.  On 30 October 2003, Ahmed Fahda, the brother of the offender, was shot and killed by two gunmen at a service station in Punchbowl.  Adnan Darwiche, the brother of the deceased, was charged with soliciting to murder in relation to that killing.  7Two other people were charged in relation to that murder.  Adnan Darwiche was subsequently acquitted but is otherwise serving life sentences in relation to shootings and murders associated with this conflict.  Subjective circumstances  8I find the following facts to have been established on the balance of probabilities.  The offender was born in April 1987 and so was 21 at the time of the events that give rise to these proceedings.  He was 24 at the time of the trial.  He is the fifth of six children, of whom four are still alive.  He has a half-brother from his father's subsequent relationship.  His parents are of Sunni Muslim heritage from North Lebanon and came to Australia when he was very young.  He had no memory of living in Lebanon.  9There is a family history of mental illness.  One of the offender's brothers had been admitted to hospital for treatment for schizophrenia.  His sister had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.  His father also had some unspecified psychiatric problems.  The offender's own early development would appear to have been normal until shortly before he came into contact with a mental health service following an incident in which his father stabbed his mother in the family home.  He was about eight at the time.  His father was sentenced to imprisonment for a number of years.  The offender had an understandable emotional reaction to all of this.  He was subsequently teased about it at school, which led to anger management problems.  This in turn led to continuing trouble at school and his regular school attendance was interrupted.  He saw a psychiatrist on several occasions during 1998 and 1999.  10While his mother was recovering, the offender went to live with his older brother.  He remains angry at the way he was treated while in his brother's care.  During this period he was beaten and witnessed significant violent events both inside and outside the home.  The offender attended Birrong, Lakemba and Granville Primary Schools and was sexually abused by a school principal when he was about 10.  In approximately August 1998 the school counsellor at Birrong Primary School recorded the following entry in a file maintained with respect to the offender:  ""Would you please forward this file to counsellor at Granville P.S.  It has been requested because Mohammed is not functioning well in the classroom and has significant anger outbursts.  I have spoken to the school counsellor about Mohammed's emotional difficulties coping with his father being in gaol.  Mohammed expresses a lot of frustration because he is not supposed to talk about the family situation and still misses his father.""  The offender was aged only eleven years at the date of this entry.  11He completed Year 7 at Birrong Boys' High School and later attended Punchbowl Boys' High School from which he was expelled at the age of 14.  When he was in Year 8 he went to live with his father following his father's release from prison but he did not get on with him.  He was living with his father in 2003 when his brother was murdered.   After his brother died he was prescribed antipsychotic medication by a psychiatrist from the local mental health service.   He had begun to hear voices and see things at this time.  He did not leave the house for two years and developed a severe depressive illness.  Pre-existing auditory hallucinations worsened.  Moreover, he developed frank paranoid ideation, which was an extension of a traumatic stress reaction in the context of a strong biological propensity towards psychosis given the family history of schizophrenia.  12Following his brother's death, the offender took it upon himself to protect the family.  He moved back to his mother's house approximately one month later.  He stayed awake at night and would only sleep when his mother and sisters had arisen.  He made sure that all of the windows and doors were locked and he remained vigilant, watchful and wary.  The offender was subject to ideas of reference, which was an extension of his paranoid illness.  This worsened in adolescence and young adulthood.  13Following his brother's death the offender commenced abusing cocaine.  This started at the age of 16 and continued until he came to prison.  The offender spent eight months in gaol between December 2007 and July 2008 awaiting trial for assault but was ultimately acquitted.  Whilst in custody at that time he was stabbed and seriously wounded.  He spent time in hospital recovering from his wounds and a subsequent infection.  Following this the offender suffered from increased paranoid ideation and made a direct connection between this incident and his brother's murder.  The offender went back to live with his mother following his release.  He received no appropriate mental health care.  14The offender began carrying a pistol with him at all times for his protection after his release.  He has had an indifferent employment history and has effectively never worked in any form of regular or full-time employment.  He is untrained and unskilled in any vocational setting.  15The offender is of below average intelligence.  Psychological testing revealed him to have a verbal and performance intelligence in only the second percentile range.  Overall intelligence was tested in the first percentile range.  He was found to be easily distracted, consistent with paranoia.  His alienation scores showed him to have an unsatisfactory emotional life, to be suspicious, sensitive and anxious, and to feel unaccepted and alienated with a denial of normal expression.  His scores were associated with personality characteristics evidenced by unusual thoughts, periodic anxieties, and difficulties relating to others, as well as with feelings of isolation, estrangement and loneliness.  These are in keeping with his personal history.  16The offender has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoid schizophrenia in the context of an extremely low intelligence. There is a family history of psychotic illness as well.  His psychiatric illness is of long standing and predates the offence for which he is being sentenced.  He has a very low emotional intelligence, is severely intellectually disadvantaged and lacks insight into his condition, which he has never learned effectively to manage.  Defences and findings consistent with the verdict  17The only significant matters that were in dispute before the jury related to self-defence, the partial defence of provocation and the partial defence of substantial impairment.  In the events that occurred, it is clear that the jury either rejected or did not accept any of these defences.  Having regard to the way in which they were articulated, however, it was clear that there was a significant relationship between each defence and the offender's subjective circumstances, particularly his level of intellectual function and his mental condition.  However, the fact that the jury rejected the defences raised by the offender does not mean that his evidence was rejected or should now be rejected.  Nor does it mean that the factual matters underlying the defences cease to have any significance for present purposes.  18For example, in R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466 at 485, Lee CJ at CL said:  ""The rejection of [provocation and self-defence] (or any other defences) does not necessarily mean that the accused cannot get the benefit, as a mitigating factor, at least to some extent of the factual basis upon which they rested.  If the sentencing judge is satisfied from credible evidence in the case that there was a degree of provocation, he may take it into account as a mitigating factor; likewise, if the judge is satisfied from credible evidence that there was an element of self defence involved in the killing.""  19To like effect, Hoeben J in R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739 at [50] - [54] held that the combination of self-defence, intoxication and provocation (all of which were rejected by the jury) combined to place the offence at the bottom of the range.  The same applies to the evidence relating to the offender's mental illness.  This is referred to later in these reasons.  Self-defence  20It is clear that the rejection of the defence of self-defence means that the jury found that there was no reasonable possibility that the offender believed that his act of shooting the deceased was necessary in order to defend himself.  The offender gave evidence that he shot the deceased because he thought that the deceased was going to shoot him.  There was no evidence that the deceased was armed at the time with a firearm or any weapon at all and no weapon was found upon the deceased following the shooting.  The jury must have rejected the offender's explanation for having shot the deceased.  I am not satisfied that there is any evidence upon the basis of which I could find that there is any element of self-defence involved in the commission of this offence.  Provocation  21The jury also rejected the offender's case on the issue of provocation.  It was contended on behalf of the offender that the most likely reason for this is that the jury accepted that the offender lost self-control as a result of his encounter with the deceased but did not accept that the conduct of the deceased could cause an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost his self-control as to form an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm.  It was submitted on behalf of the offender that the jury may have accepted the evidence that was led to establish provocation, but found that the defence failed the test in              s 23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 .  Upon this basis it was submitted that I would accept that the actions of the offender were the result of a loss of self-control brought about by something that the deceased said to the offender about the murder of the offender's brother.  It was contended that such a finding was not inconsistent with the jury's verdict.  22The evidence in my opinion supports a finding that something happened between the offender and the deceased that caused or provoked the offender to act as he did.  It seems apparent that the offender did not take the gun and start shooting immediately upon seeing the deceased.  There were two conversations before that occurred.  In this respect I observe that the offender gave evidence that the deceased said words to him that contained or amounted to a threat.  For example, the offender gave evidence as follows:  ""Q.  What did you do then?  A.  He started to approach me and that's when I approached him.  Q.  Do you know exactly where you met?  A.  Halfway between, halfway between, like.  Q.  What was said between you at that stage - withdraw that.  First of all, did you know that that man was Abdul Darwiche?  A.  No.  Q.  Did he say something to you?  A.  When he got there?  Q.  Yeah.  A.  He asked me, he asked me ""is my name Mohammed Fahda?""  I said ""yes.""  I said to him ""what's your name?""  He said ""I'm Abdul Darwiche.""  Q.  What did you do then?  A.  I was in shock.  Q.  What do you mean you were in shock?  A.  You hear the name and you hear the description but you don't think it will actually happen, like.  I never think, like, I would really bump into him.  Q.  So what happened next?  A.  He said a few things then he went back to his car, and that's when I went back to my car.  Q.  What language was this conversation in?  A.  Arabic.  Q.  When you say ""he said a few things"" what did he say, can you remember?  A.  He threatened my brother Hussein and me.  And he said he's going to kill us the way he killed my brother Ahmed.  Q.  Did he say that in Arabic?  A.  Yes, in Arabic.""  23The offender had earlier given a version of what occurred to Dr Greenberg and Dr Nielssen that included a claim that the deceased had threatened to kill him.  24There is also evidence of the relevant history between the Fahda and Darwiche families.  This included the undisputed evidence of pre-existing animosity over many years, the murder of the offender's brother by men associated with the Darwiche family and evidence of the deceased's reputation for violence, and his propensity to carry firearms and shoot people in public places that was known to the police and the wider community.  This was apparent from the evidence given by Det Oxford in cross-examination as follows:  ""Q. Mr Oxford, is it fair to say that the deceased in the case that the jury is dealing with, the man Abdul Darwiche, was suspected by police to have been involved in a large number of shooting incidents?  A.  Yes, certainly he was charged with two shootings.  Q.  In that context, did he, that is the deceased, Abdul Darwiche, have a reputation for violence?  A.  Yes.  Q.  That was a reputation known to the police?  A.  Yes.  Q.  It was also a reputation known within the wider community?  A.  Yes.  Q.  And particularly the Lebanese, middle eastern community?  A.  Middle eastern community, yes.  *****  Q.  That computer contains information including warnings to help police in doing their job?  A.  Yes.  Q.  It includes warnings about when people are considered to be dangerous if approached?  A.  Yes.  Q.  Abdul Darwiche, the deceased in this case, was a person for whom such a warning would be given to any police officer approaching him, is that correct?  A.  Yes.  Q.  The warning is a little more specific in that it will also warn the officers if the person may be expected to be carrying a gun?  A.  Yes.  Q.  In relation to the deceased, Abdul Darwiche, the computer certainly would have warned any officer approaching him that he may well be carrying a gun?  A.  Yes, it did.  Q.  I think you are in charge of a number of investigations into shootings by members of the Darwiche family and associates of theirs?  A.  Yes, and other families.  Q.  The family of Razzak was a family known to have an ongoing dispute with the Darwiche family, correct?  A.  Yes, that's correct.  Q.  And the Fahda family was associated with the Razzak family?  A.  Yes.  Q.  The Darwiche family were known to possess firearms?  A.  Yes.  Q.  That includes Abdul Darwiche?  A.  Yes.""  25The medical evidence also established that the offender had psychiatric complaints that affected his ability to control himself.  Dr Nielssen gave this evidence on that issue:  ""Q.  Did you come to the conclusion that Mr Fahda's abnormal state of mind affected his perception of events?  A.  Yes, I did.  Q.  And that it seemed that he interpreted a chance meeting with Mr Darwiche, and comments made by Mr Darwiche and his hurrying back to the car and then perceiving him to block his exit, as being dangerous to him?  A.  Yes.  He's got an altered perception of events because he has a heightened perception of threat and sees more danger in commonplace events than another person might.  Q.  ...  Did you form the opinion that those things affected his capacity to understand events?  A.  Yes.  In the same way as I described a moment ago, in the heightened perception of threat.  Q.  I think you agree with Dr Greenberg that those conditions may have or did affect his ability to control himself?  A.  Yes.  In the sense that if you're in that acutely fearful state your tendency to act on impulse or without thinking is greater than a person who wasn't affected in that way.""  26In my opinion it is apparent, and I find, that there was evidence to support a conclusion that there was a degree of provocation, falling short of the partial defence of provocation at law, which directly affects and mitigates an assessment of the objective seriousness of the crime.  Substantial impairment  27The jury also rejected the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.  In the circumstances of this case, particularly having regard to the undisputed medical evidence, it seems apparent, and I find, that the jury rejected this defence upon the basis that it did not accept that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.  As will be clear from related matters referred to elsewhere in these remarks, and my findings concerning the offender's mental illness, the offender had and continues to have significant mental health problems, which have been documented over many years.  I find that the jury could not, acting reasonably, have rejected that history or the opinions of the experts.  The jury must, however, have accepted that an application of community standards did not permit them to reduce the offender's liability to manslaughter.  Relevance of the degree of provocation  28Section 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that evidence of provocation may be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor in sentencing.  In R v Heffernan , Hoeben J stated at [50]:  ""[50] While provocation in law was not open to the degree that may have reduced murder to manslaughter, that is not to say that the question of provocation is not of relevance for an assessment of the prisoner's objective criminality. There were as I have found circumstances which did amount to provocation, albeit that they did not reach the level required to reduce murder to manslaughter, and accordingly provocation can be taken into account as mitigating the objective severity of the conduct of the prisoner.""  29To like effect in R v Borg [2010] NSWSC 951, Studdert AJ considered that, while not amounting to a defence, evidence of provocation in combination with the offender's personality disorders and chronic anxiety had an impact upon his ability to exercise self-control.  At [39] his Honour said this:  ""[39]... I find that what the deceased said, and her decision to replace him as a director and to ask him to leave the business altogether impacted on the self control of the offender and that there was a measure of loss of self control when this crime was committed. In making this finding I have regard to the medical evidence which I accept as to the offender's personality disorder and his chronic anxiety state. Those disorders accounted in part for the impact on the offender's self control.""  30In the present case, the words that were uttered to the offender by the deceased, in combination with his particular mental health issues and his perception that the deceased was preventing him from leaving the service station, are circumstances that, although insufficient to constitute an excuse or defence at law, were circumstances that I find amounted to provocation for the purposes of s 21A(3)(c).  I have taken them into account in mitigation of the objective criminality of the offence.  Relevance of the offender's mental illness  31This is not a case in which the offender's mental illness only arose or was detected only after the commission of the crime.  The offender's condition is of long standing and is well-documented.  Evidence of mental illness or intellectual disability is relevant to sentencing in a number of ways.  In R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228, Grove J said this at [33] - [35]:  ""[33] Mental illness may be relevant - and was relevant in the present case - in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced: Henry at [254]; Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23]; Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [51]; Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]; Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43].  [34] Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration: Pearce (NSW CCA, 1 November 1996, unreported); Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ; Letteri (NSW CCA, 18 March 1992, unreported); Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42].  [35] Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: Tsiaras at [400]; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26].""  32In R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [21] - [23], Spigelman CJ discussed the effect of mental illness on culpability as follows:  ""[21] The significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercise has long been accepted. The relevant authorities have been reviewed in this Court, the Victorian Court of Appeal and the Western Australian Full Court. See R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48] per Simpson J; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45] per Smart AJ; see also R v Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333, esp [43]-[51] per Malcolm CJ; R v Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; see also Potas, Sentencing Manual: Law Principles and Practice in New South Wales 2001 at 285-286; Fox and Freiberg, Sentencing State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed), 1999 at 293-294.  [22] In the present case, the Crown was prepared to concede that some mitigation was appropriate, on the basis of giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence. However, that is not the only way in which mental illness impinges on the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  [23] To the extent that mental illness explains the offence - as her Honour found to be the position in the present case - then an offender's inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood CJ at CL put it in Henry, supra, at [254]:  '... the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing.'""  33These principles were applied in R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247; (2004) 149 A Crim R 38.  The Court said this at [41]:  ""[41] While we are not persuaded the evidence would support a finding that the Applicant suffered from a serious psychiatric or personality disorder, there was sufficient, in our view, to warrant a finding that his objective criminality was reduced beyond that which a bare analysis of the neglected state of the deceased would, at first blush, suggest.""  34Moreover, in Lewis v R [2011] NSWCCA 206 at [14], I observed that:  ""[14] In cases involving offenders suffering from intellectual disabilities or mental disorders, general deterrence is given less weight and may be moderated according to the extent to which a particular offender knows what he or she is doing and the gravity of his or her actions...""  35An offender with intellectual or mental health disabilities is not an appropriate medium for general deterrence: see R v George .  Similarly, questions of personal deterrence may have less significance because the interests of society do not require that persons with a relevant disability should be punished as severely as a person without a disability: R v Anderson (1980) 2 A Crim R 379 at 384-5.  36It was contended on behalf of the offender that there was no basis in the evidence to support the Crown's submission concerning the offender's future dangerousness.  Dr Greenberg's most recent report acknowledges that predictions in this case are ""speculative"" and ""imprecise"".  It was contended on behalf of the offender that his psychiatric, psychological and intellectual disabilities were central to a proper assessment of the appropriate sentence to be imposed: see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [32] and [54] - [58].  37The evidence is all to the effect that the offender had a well-documented history of mental illness and that there was a strong family history of mental illness as well.  I find that the mental condition of the offender was more probably than not significantly affected by the several incidents and influences that marked out his life, including witnessing an extremely violent assault by his father upon his mother when he was aged eight, being sexually assaulted himself by the principal when still only in primary school, the murder of his brother and the pervading fear of persecution that this caused, as well as his having been stabbed whilst in custody and subsequently hospitalised.  38I accept that the offender suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder that was caused and evident prior to the commission of the offence and that this was associated with hyper-vigilance, paranoia, auditory hallucinations, depression and inverted sleep patterns.  I also find that the offender was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder or an anxiety disorder and a probable psychotic illness.  I have taken all of this into account in mitigation of the objective criminality of the offence.  Standard non-parole period  39For the offence of murder, committed after 1 February 2003, there is a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  The latter applies in cases falling in the mid range of objective seriousness.  However, since Muldrock it is clear that the standard non-parole period says little about the appropriate sentence for this particular offence.  The relevant standard non-parole period does not have ""determinative significance"" and is not the ""starting point "" in sentencing for a mid-range offence after conviction: see Muldrock at [17] and [31] - [32].  40It is now clear that a ""two stage"" approach, involving first a comparison between the offence and an hypothesised mid-range offence (as per R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at 580), followed by an inquiry about the existence of reasons to justify a longer or a shorter period on parole, is neither permitted nor justified: Muldrock at [28].  Instead, the High Court there endorsed the ""instinctive synthesis"" approach revealed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 378 in the judgment of McHugh J:  ""[51]... by which the judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case.  Only at the end of the process does the judge determine the sentence.""  Objective seriousness  41The Crown contended that this was a case where a sentence of life imprisonment was appropriate.  This was said to be so because the level of culpability was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence could only be met through the imposition of the maximum sentence.  It follows from that submission that the Crown was contending that this case fell into the worst category of cases of murder.  42According to the Crown's submissions, this case involved a cold-blooded execution in a public place.  It occurred in front of the deceased's wife and his children.  The Crown submitted that it was motivated by hatred and revenge because the offender thought that the deceased's family or associates were responsible for the death of his brother.  The Crown described these events using a series of epithets, to which senior counsel for the offender took particular exception, which included ""atrocious"", ""detestable"", ""hateful"", ""odious"", ""gravely reprehensible"" and ""extremely wicked"".  43The Crown additionally emphasised that the offence was aggravated by the use of a handgun, which the offender conceded in his evidence he was in the habit of carrying.  The possession and use of handguns was said to be something that could not and should not be tolerated.  The Crown contended that those who carry and use handguns could expect little sympathy when they appear for sentence and that any sentence that is imposed upon the offender should send a clear message that the community cannot and will not condone their use.  44The Crown specifically acknowledged the grave significance of a sentence of life imprisonment and what has been said in that regard in R v Garforth (unreported, NSWCCA, 23 May 1994) and the cases that have followed it.  The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of this offence is such as to bring the imposition of a life sentence within the appropriate exercise of the sentencing discretion.  The Crown submitted that there was an absence of factors that would mitigate its seriousness.  45In stark contrast to these submissions, senior counsel for the offender contended that this case was far removed from a worst case example of the crime of murder.  He offered several reasons for this in support of the ultimate submission that the subject offence fell below the mid range of objective seriousness for murder.  First, there was no premeditation or planning.  Offences without planning will usually fall below the mid range of objective seriousness:  see, for example, R v Shepherd [2006] NSWSC 799 at [49] - [50], [61] and [65]; R v Saalfeld [2007] NSWSC 376 at [24]; R v Cooper [2005] NSWSC 791 at [103].  In Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 363; (2007) 180 A Crim R 267, Smart AJ (with whom Mason P and Adams J agreed) said at [143], ""an intention to kill and premeditation are usual elements in a murder of mid range objective seriousness"".  The offender's submissions emphasised that the meeting between him and the deceased was a matter of pure chance, a factor to which the Crown's submissions make no specific reference.  46Secondly, there is evidence of a degree of provocation.  In R v Cooper at [103], Buddin J found that evidence of ""a measure of provocation"" and the absence of premeditation brought an offence of murder below the mid range.  In R v Heffernan at [54], evidence of a degree of provocation and self-defence combined to place the offence of murder at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness.  47Thirdly, while murder is always an offence of grave seriousness (see, for example, Nguyen at [144]), the circumstances of this particular offence do not have characteristics of gratuitous violence or brutal cruelty often present in cases at or above the mid range of objective seriousness: see, for example, R v Matheson [2006] NSWSC 332; R v Hillsley [2006] NSWCCA 312; (2006) 164 A Crim R 252; R v Owens [2008] NSWSC 1375.  48It was submitted on behalf of the offender that the combination of a lack of planning or premeditation, evidence of provocation, and a lack of gratuitous cruelty or violence bring the objective seriousness of the present offence below the mid range for murder offences.  While the use of a weapon is an aggravating feature, it ""is not unusual in this kind of offence"": per Hoeben J in R v Shepherd at [58].  49It was conceded that the offence occurred in the presence of members of the deceased's family and that that was an aggravating feature of the offence.  However, it was submitted that the commission of the offence was a spontaneous response to a chance meeting, which reduced the significance of this factor.  The offender denied in cross-examination that he saw the children.  50The objective seriousness of the offence is to be determined without reference to the personal attributes of the offender, but ""wholly by reference to the nature of the offending"": Muldrock at [27].  However, such factors remain particularly relevant to any determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  Other mitigating features  51The absence of premeditation, the offender's mental health, the background of violence, including the death of the offender's brother and the associated provocation, have all been referred to as mitigating features of this offence.  In addition, the offender does not have any significant criminal record of previous convictions.  He was 21 at the time of the commission of the offence.  It was contended on his behalf that by reason of his youth and lack of a significant record the offender had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend.  The offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.  52In addition, the offender made a series of admissions that facilitated the efficient conduct of the trial.  This resulted in a relatively short trial occupying less than two weeks.  In this way the administration of justice was facilitated and a court is entitled to reduce the penalty in recognition of this fact: s 22A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act .  Victim impact statements  53A series of victim impact statements from the close relatives of the deceased, including his wife and children, were read aloud to the Court.  All spoke of his or her own reaction to the death, as well as that of the extended family.  All of these people would appear to be labouring with the burden of grief in various and personal ways.  The death of the deceased is undoubtedly a terrible and unending fact of life for them and the rest of the family.  Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of his family and friends who remember him.  I am, however, mindful of the principles referred to in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, and I must conform to them.  Contrition and remorse  54Senior counsel for the offender quite properly conceded that it was difficult in circumstances where the offender has pleaded not guilty to make too much of a claim in his favour based upon contrition and remorse.  However, the offender wrote a letter in his own hand that was tendered before me and the sentiments expressed in the letter are necessarily important in the scheme of things.  The letter was in the following terms:  ""Since I been arrested till today I'm in segro.  I'm locked in my cell 22 hours a day in four walls.  I've had plenty of time to think of my actions.  Segro is a punishment in a punishment.   Only if I could go back in time and change the circumstances.  Unfortunately I took a man's life from his wife and kids, which I regret and I'm sorry.  I was not in control of my actions.  I have limited memory of my actions.  I was not thinking straight.  I panicked because I am still traumatised from my brother's death.  The way he died and where it happened and how it happened.  I did not see his wife and kids and other family members at the time.  I was numb and blank and not thinking straight.  It was like I was not in my body.  My mum and dad constantly cry when they see me.  They lost one son and have lost another one.  I have caused a lot of trauma to my family and others.  It was not revenge that day.  I left home not going looking for him or expected to see him because I felt blank and shocked.  I could not see a way to leave the petrol station.  I realise I have committed the ultimate sin in the Quran and Bible.  I have not stopped praying.  I believe I have found God.  I seek forgiveness from God his wife and kids, my family and your Honour.  I trust your Honour will judge me right.  I will accept what your Honour gives me.  Intelligence say[s] my life [is] in danger.  Even if I do get sentenced I'm not getting out of segro for a long time.""  55The offender did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings.  No submissions were made by the Crown to suggest that I should not treat the offender's letter at face value as an expression of remorse.  Conditions of incarceration  56The offender's solicitor Mr Raheb swore an affidavit that was read without objection at the sentencing proceedings.  Mr Raheb said that he had visited the offender at the Lithgow Correctional Centre on 25 July 2011 in connection with these proceedings.  He said that the acting security supervisor at the prison told him that the offender has one of the highest security classifications in the facility.  He was told that there were concerns for his safety.  The supervisor also informed Mr Raheb that there were intelligence reports to suggest that the offender should be segregated for his own safety and that the highest security protocols had to be followed.  The offender cannot be permitted to be in contact with mainstream inmates.  57Mr Raheb also said that on 30 November 2011 he telephoned the prison and spoke to Mr Andrew Child.  Mr Child informed Mr Raheb that the offender was classified as an A2 inmate.  That has been his security classification since he was first incarcerated in 2009.  He is in the maximum security section of the prison and in segregation.  The offender is in a cell for 22 hours every day with two hours of exercise.  Mr Child said that the offender's classification would not be reviewed until after he is sentenced.  The Serious Offenders Review Council will then review him.  Special circumstances  58Counsel for the offender submitted that a finding of ""special circumstances"" for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was justified and warranted by reason of the offender's age, his lack of education, his lack of vocational training or work experience and his mental illness and low intelligence.  These all suggested a significant need for supervision and intensive assistance by appropriate professionals upon his return to the community.  Findings and consideration  59I am of the view that the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt, and consistently with the verdict of the jury, that the offender shot the deceased with the intention of killing him.  I am of the view, however, that in the circumstances of this case the offence of murder falls in the mid range of objective seriousness.  This is for the following reasons.  60I accept that the crime was spontaneous and unplanned.  The offender and the deceased encountered one another at a location unconnected to either of them and purely by chance.  As far as the evidence revealed it, there would appear never to have been any prior encounter or meeting between the two men in any public or private setting, with the possible exception of a courtroom or its immediate vicinity.  The offender had no reason to suspect that the deceased would be at the service station and was surprised to see him there.  61The offence was not associated with any gratuitous cruelty or additional violence beyond that which was instrumental in causing the death of the deceased.  There was no degrading conduct or taunting of the deceased or any prolongation or extension of the events that led to his death.  62I find that there was an element of provocation.  People associated with the deceased had murdered the offender's brother.  The deceased spoke to the offender at the scene immediately before he was killed and threatened him in direct and forceful terms.  I find that these factors influenced the offender in the formation of his intention to kill the deceased and caused him to suffer a significant loss of his self-control.  63I am not satisfied that the offender was, in any way, acting in self-defence.  The deceased was not armed and he presented no immediate threat of personal physical danger or harm to the offender as he drove out of the service station.  64I reject the Crown's submission that this case of murder falls into the worst category.  I also acknowledge the force of the offender's rejection of the emotive descriptions of the offence upon which the Crown placed some considerable emphasis.  It is not particularly helpful to me for the events that give rise to these proceedings to be described as ""atrocious"", ""detestable"", ""hateful"", ""odious"", ""gravely reprehensible"" or ""extremely wicked"" without some corresponding but particular contextual analysis of the offence in question.  There can be no doubt that any death of an unsuspecting and innocent person will necessarily invite descriptions that reflect very critically and pejoratively upon the perpetrator, but all of the circumstances of the case need to be considered.  65I acknowledge that the offence took place in public and in the presence of the deceased's family and that the death was the result of an aggressive and violent act.  However, the whole incident unfolded and concluded in a very short space of time.  It is conspicuously adorned with limited informative contemporaneous, as opposed to historical, detail.  66In determining what is an appropriate sentence in any particular case, other mitigating and aggravating factors not directly informing the objective seriousness of the offence are relevant.  They have all been referred to above in the context of counsels' submissions.  Predominant in my opinion are the significant subjective features of the offender.  He was relatively young at the time of the offence.  This does not represent a factor that operates of itself to ameliorate the extent of the offender's criminality but is relevant to the question of his prospects for rehabilitation and, by necessary inference, to the likelihood of reoffending.  It should also be considered in the context of his insignificant criminal record.  67With the exception of a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2007, for which the offender was placed on a s 9 bond, his criminal record is limited to motor vehicle offences and offences committed as a juvenile.  No offences involving the use of weapons, and in particular no offences involving the use of firearms, are recorded.  These are matters that give me confidence that the offender is a good candidate for rehabilitation and has good prospects of not reoffending.  I acknowledge that from a medical point of view the predictions that can be made about the offender in these respects are necessarily speculative and imprecise.  On the other hand, there are no apparent countervailing factors that suggest that reoffending is likely, far less certain, or that the offender will prove to be resistant to positive influences toward rehabilitation.  I am unable to conclude that the offender is likely to be a danger to the public upon his release.   68I am particularly mindful that the offender's psychiatric, psychological and intellectual disabilities are central to a proper assessment of the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  I have no doubt that the offender's mental illness contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way, so that his moral culpability is correspondingly reduced.  I consider that in this case the call for denunciation must be tempered and the punishment warranted should accordingly be reduced.  I have in mind in this regard the findings of the medical experts who have examined the offender, which suggest that he suffered from a paranoid psychosis with symptoms including hyper-vigilance and auditory hallucinations superimposed upon a limited intelligence.  It is highly likely that the offender's responses to the actual threats that were made to him by the deceased, and the threats that he perceived were being made, such as that the deceased was blocking his exit from the car park, resulted in responses from him that might have been different in a mentally healthy and more intelligent person.  I find that what the deceased said to the offender had an impact on his self-control and that there was a considerable loss of self-control when this crime was committed.  In making this finding I have had regard to the medical evidence, which I accept as to the offender's psychiatric disorders.  Those disorders accounted in part for the impact on the offender's self-control.  69I also consider that the offender is not a proper vehicle for pronouncements about general deterrence.  The crime in this case was particularly enigmatic and idiosyncratic.  It cannot be viewed as one into the commission of which members of the public are likely regularly, or habitually, to descend.  It is unrelated to a course of common criminal behaviour from which it unfolded or emerged.  It was, on the contrary, spontaneous and impulsive.  In so saying I accept that the fact that the offender had for some years customarily armed himself with the very pistol that caused the death is a factor about which the courts should speak in unambiguous denunciation and to which regard must be had in sentencing this offender.  By the same token, that weapon had not previously been used to cause death or commit a crime, but was carried as a function of the offender's response to his paranoid and hyper-vigilant perception of threat.  70I also take into account the fact that the offender is likely to serve the whole of his time in custody in maximum security and in some form of protective segregation.  At least for the near future the offender will be incarcerated within a system that also houses members of, or persons associated with, rival families with an established history of enmity and violence.  The restrictive conditions to which the offender is and will continue to be subjected are extremely onerous and will make his imprisonment particularly and unusually difficult for him.  I am satisfied that his particular psychiatric problems will also adversely intersect with his limited freedoms within the prison system.  71I have some difficulty in assessing whether or not the offender is genuinely remorseful.  He gave evidence at the trial but did not do so at the sentencing proceedings.  His letter speaks in terms that are remorseful on their face but it has to be contrasted with the fact that the offender pleaded not guilty.  I acknowledge that he made admissions and that his plea was undoubtedly motivated by the prospect that his defences were meritorious.  I also have to accommodate the offender's low intelligence and the extent to which his insight and self-awareness may be reduced by that fact.  In technical terms the offender has provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and in that way is entitled to be given credit for the remorse that he has shown.  He has certainly acknowledged that he has deprived a wife of her husband and children of their father.  The letter is, however, not altogether selfless in its tone.  I am only able to take limited account of the offender's expressions of remorse as a mitigating factor.  72I find special circumstances.  In particular the offender's probable need for ongoing and intensive psychiatric treatment, his low levels of educational and vocational training and experience, and his low intelligence all suggest the need for long and close supervision when he returns to the community.  The sentence  73The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 28 September 2009.  The sentence I impose should commence on that day.  74Mohammed Fahda, for the murder of Abdul Darwiche, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years.  I set a non-parole period of 14 years, which will be taken to have commenced on 28 September 2009 and which will expire on 27 September 2023, and a balance of term of 6 years, commencing on 28 September 2023 and expiring on 27 September 2029.  The first day upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 28 September 2023.  **********

2708544,Edwards v DPP [2012] NSWSC 105,"Judgment 

Introduction 
1On 17 September 2010 the plaintiff was involved in an altercation with a security officer at a tavern. He was affected by alcohol at the time. He was charged with common assault pursuant to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum sentence for this offence is 12 months imprisonment and/or 20 penalty units. He was also charged with ""excluded person remain in vicinity of licensed premises"" contrary to s 77(8)(a) of the Liquor Act 2007. The maximum penalty for this offence is 50 penalty units. The plaintiff ultimately pleaded guilty to each offence. 

2The police statement of facts was accepted by the plaintiff. The offences were not serious enough, in the opinion of the second defendant, to entail a full time custodial sentence and, of course, such a sentence was not available under s 77(8)(a). 

3The plaintiff was born in 1952. He has had a problem with alcohol for much of his life. This is reflected in a lengthy criminal record primarily for alcohol related offences, including a significant number of drink driving and driving whilst disqualified convictions. He was on probation at the time of the subject offences. 

4On 19 August 2011 the plaintiff made an application to the second defendant pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. The application was refused. 

5The plaintiff, by amended summons filed in this court on 27 October 2011, sought the following orders: 

""1. Leave to appeal with regard to an appeal against conviction that involves a question of mixed law and fact, pursuant to s 53(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2011. 

2. An order upholding the appeal against conviction and quashing the conviction. 

3. In the alternative to order 1, leave to appeal with regard to an interlocutory order made by a Local Court in relation to the Plaintiff in summary proceedings, pursuant to s 53(3)(b) of the same Act. 

4. In the alternative to order 2, an order upholding the appeal against the interlocutory order and quashing that order. 

5. An order remitting the matter to Blacktown Local Court to be dealt with according to law. 

6. In the alternative to the above orders, an order in the nature of certiorari pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 removing the record of proceedings at Blacktown Local Court into this Court, and quashing the refusal of the magistrate to deal with the Plaintiff under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 2007."" 

6The orders were opposed by the first defendant. The second defendant filed an appearance submitting to the orders of the Court save as to costs. 

7The orders were sought in the alternative as there was uncertainty as to whether his Honour, the second defendant, had, on rejection of the s 32 application, implicitly convicted the plaintiff, in which event the appeal was pursuant to s 53(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, or whether the determination of the s 32 application was an interlocutory order, in which event the appeal was pursuant to s 53(3)(b), or whether the decision of the s 32 application was merely a ruling, in which event the appropriate means of relief was provided by s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970. 

8Although the issue was not beyond doubt, counsel for the plaintiff and first defendant agreed, that for the purposes of the appeal, it should be accepted that the plaintiff was appealing pursuant to s 53(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 as on an appeal from conviction and that accordingly the plaintiff required leave to appeal on a question involving mixed law and fact. In light of my determination of the matter it is unnecessary to examine the correctness of the course adopted. 

Consideration 
9The Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 provides as follows: 

"" 31 Application 

(1) This Part applies to criminal proceedings in respect of summary offences or indictable offences triable summarily, being proceedings before a Magistrate, and includes any related proceedings under the Bail Act 1978, but does not apply to committal proceedings. 

32 Persons suffering from mental illness or condition 

(1) If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate: 

(a) that the defendant is (or was at the time of the alleged commission of the offence to which the proceedings relate): 

(i) developmentally disabled, or 
(ii) suffering from mental illness, or 
(iii) suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a mental health facility, 

but is not a mentally ill person, and 

(b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law, 

the Magistrate may take the action set out in subsection (2) or (3). 

..."" 

10In Director of Public Prosecutions v El Mawas [2006] NSWCA 154 at [71] the court held: 

""Part 3 of the Act requires a Magistrate to balance the public interest in those charged with a criminal offence facing the full weight of the law against the public interest in treating, or regulating to the greatest extent practical, the conduct of individuals suffering from any of the mental conditions referred to in s 32(1) or mental illness (s 33) with the object of ensuring that the community is protected from the conduct of such persons... 

the significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercise has long been accepted. Pt 3 is clearly intended to permit the Magistrate, if it is appropriate, to divert a defendant from being exposed to sentence, with his or her mental condition being taken into account at that comparatively late stage... 

s 32...requires the Magistrate to make at least three decisions. The first is to determine, in accordance with s 32(1)(a), whether the defendant is eligible to be dealt with under that section. That question clearly involves a finding of fact and is properly described as the jurisdictional question... 

The Magistrate must next determine whether, having regard to the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant (including presumably any information the Magistrate has garnered under s 36), 'it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law. That decision clearly calls for the exercise of subjective or value judgments in which ""...'no one [consideration] and no combination of [considerations] is necessarily determinative of the result' ... it involves a discretionary decision in which the Magistrate is permitted latitude as to the decision which might be made, a latitude confined only by the subject matter and object of the Act... 

the discretionary judgment could not be exercised properly without due regard to the seriousness of the offending conduct. 

Once a Magistrate has determined that it is more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with s 32 the Magistrate must determine which of the actions set out in sub-s 2 or sub-s 3 should be taken. 

No doubt a Magistrate considering [the availability of the diversionary remedy regime] will consider whether proceeding in accordance with s 32 will produce a better outcome both for the individual and the community..."" 

11The plaintiff relied upon a report of the psychiatrist, Dr Westmore, dated 2 August 2011. Critical portions of the report were as follows: 

""He does not have a mental illness as suggested by the psychologist, but he does suffer from a mental condition (alcohol related organic brain damage) and because of that the court, if it felt it were appropriate, could consider him under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990... 

At the time I saw him, I thought he was reasonably motivated however to seek further assistance for some of his difficulties and if his matter is dealt with under s 32, I would recommend the following treatment plan: 

1. That he attend Dr Andrew Fong, who has a surgery in the Blacktown General Practice, Westpoint, Blacktown. Dr Fong has cared for Mr Edwards for a number of years and is no doubt very familiar with his various medical problems. 

2. That he attend an alcohol rehabilitation programme at the Blacktown Hospital. He needs to enter into sobriety because any alcohol consumption will aggravate his existing brain injury and his subsequent memory and general cognition problems. 

3. He should be referred to the Blacktown Community Mental Health Service for continuing support. He remains a highly vulnerable man and he is currently under a great deal of stress following the sudden ending of a long-term relationship. He has probably experienced some periods of depression associated with that and depression will increase his risk of relapsing back to alcohol abuse. 

His prognosis both from a psychiatric and forensic perspective will improve considerably if he can cease using all alcohol. As noted, he does not suffer from a mental condition and he is not developmentally disabled but he does have a mental condition."" 

12His Honour, when the proceedings were first mentioned, read Dr Westmore's report and commented: 

""I wouldn't have thought, given that diagnosis, Mr Sutherland, that he really falls within the scope of 32. 

SUTHERLAND: Well Dr Westmore, in his opinion, believes that he does have a mental condition. 

HIS HONOUR: The difficulty alcohol and drugs don't normally fall into this category because parliament prescribed the consequences of intoxication in the Crimes Act and frankly they don't seem to have any role here. I'll leave the matter open, obviously you've only got into it very briefly so I don't want to..."" 

13Later his Honour refused the application. He gave his reasons, ex tempore, as follows: 

""This is an application on behalf of George Edwards for the matter to be dealt with under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions)Act. The tests are fairly straightforward. Firstly, the court needs to be satisfied that the defendant is either developmental disabled, that is not suggested, suffering from a mental illness, Dr Westmore's report clearly says he is not or suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a mental health facility. 

Certainly the view expressed by Dr Westmore does not resolve that issue. He says on page 6 of his report 'He does not have a mental illness as suggested by the psychologist but he does suffer from a mental condition ""alcohol related organic brain damage"".' There is no reference to it being a condition to which treatment is available in a mental health facility and that of course is as much an essential ingredient of the court's jurisdiction to deal with the matter under s 32 as are any of the other tests. 

I am not in a position and clearly have no expertise in the field to draw a conclusion whether that is an oversight that can be remedied or not or whether it is a deliberate choice of language on behalf of Dr Westmore but I assume as a senior forensic psychiatrist he chooses his words with care. 

Prime facie then the first limb of s 32 is not satisfied. To complete the picture as far as the second limb, namely the provisions under s 32(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Forensics Provisions) Act are concerned there is the balancing exercise or the weighing exercise that Mr Sutherland has referred to. The court must consider whether it is more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this part, that is essentially diversion into a treatment regime for his mental condition then otherwise in accordance with law. 

As I have already noted the criminal law makes it own specific provisions with respect to criminal liability and alcohol or drug use at the time of offence commission. Certainly s 32 extends well beyond that timeframe and in fact relates to a situation as at the day of the application rather than the day of the events but nonetheless it can be related back to the day of the offence. 

The situation that Mr Edwards faces is charges, neither of which is of the greatest seriousness, clearly involving again consumption of alcohol and Dr Westmore has observed that he suffers from alcohol related organic brain damage, self inflicted injury to his brain through the massive over consumption of alcohol over a long period. 

Mr Edwards had his first PCA at Ryde Petty Sessions in 1972. He served a number of gaol sentences for drinking and driving the most recent of which, I think was in 2006. None of this, despite repeated bonds with conditions relating to drug and alcohol supervision substance abuse and home detention, which is of course an alcohol intolerant programme, has made any difference unfortunately to Mr Edwards' combination of drinking and driving. The most recent drinking and driving offence I think being that one in 2006. 

The question ultimately is whether it is more appropriate to deal with it under s 32 than according to law. The seriousness of the offence is clearly a matter to take into account. The less serious and the more likely it would be one thing for a matter to be capable of being diverted successfully. 

The real difficulty in the present situation, it seems to me, is that every means of court ordered treatment opportunities have been provided to Mr Edwards without success and diversion into a mental health facility when he does not appear, according to Dr Westmore, to have a mental condition that is able to be - I should choose the words exactly - for which treatment is available in the mental health facility simply means diverting him into a facility which is even less equipped to deal with his situation than the criminal justice system is. 

Quite simply for the two reasons I have indicated, firstly that the lack of evidence that there is treatment available in the mental health facility for his condition but also on the issues of appropriateness, the application under s 32 is refused. 

SUTHERLAND: If the court pleases. 

HIS HONOUR: The matter is then to proceed to sentence Mr Sutherland?"" 

Determination 
14The plaintiff submitted his Honour made a factual error in determining that there was a lack of evidence that treatment was available in a mental health facility for the mental condition identified by Dr Westmore. The plaintiff submitted: 

""The report of Dr Westmore did not explicitly say in so many words that the mental condition described by the doctor was one 'for which treatment is available in a mental health facility'. However, having stated that the court could consider the plaintiff under s 32, Dr Westmore went on to lay out a detailed treatment plan. The overwhelming inference is that Dr Westmore was saying that the plaintiff fell within the preconditions of the exercise of the discretion in s 32. It is inconceivable that he was unfamiliar with the requirements of the section contained in s 32(1) but proceeding to suggest that the option under s 32 was available, and thereafter outlining a detailed treatment plan. It is also an available inference that the treatment plan was referring to treatment in the mental health facility as defined... 

Taking the report as a whole, and even accepting that the document makes no explicit reference to the precondition under discussion, the magistrate made an error of fact in finding that that precondition had not been made out. The finding of the magistrate that the author of the report was a senior forensic psychiatrist who was choosing his words with care cannot sit with the proposition of the magistrate that the whole report was suggesting that s 32 was available was founded on an enormous misconception. The finding of fact, in all the circumstances, was plainly wrong."" 

15I do not agree. The plaintiff relies upon s 32(1)(a)(iii) which provides pre-conditions to the enlivening of the s 32(1)(b) discretion. 

16The pre-conditions clearly require evidence that the defendant is (or was at the time of the alleged commission of the offence to which the proceedings relate): 

(a) suffering from a mental condition; 

(b) for which treatment is available in a mental health facility; 

(c) but is not a mentally ill person. 

17Dr Westmore expressly provides evidence in his report of facts (a) and (c). He does so in clear terms. However, he ignores the requirement that it be established that treatment is available in a mental health facility for the plaintiff's mental condition. As his Honour observed, this requirement is as much an essential ingredient in enlivening the court's jurisdiction as are any of the other tests. Dr Westmore merely says that because the plaintiff suffers from a mental condition, he could be considered under s 32 if the court felt it were appropriate. 

18If, as the parties accepted, Dr Westmore is an experienced practitioner, then the inference to be drawn is that the omission of a reference to the availability of treatment in a mental health facility for the plaintiff's condition was deliberate. Otherwise the appropriate inference is that, through an inadvertent omission, or because he had a fundamental misconception as to the requirements of the section he had not considered whether treatment was available in a mental health facility for that mental condition. 

19The absent evidence cannot be supplied by inference from the ""treatment plan"" suggested by Dr Westmore. The treatment plan provides no basis for any such inference. It consists of a number of components, namely a referral to the general practitioner, Dr Fong, for the plaintiff's various medical problems, a rehabilitation programme to enter into sobriety so as not to aggravate his existing brain damage and a referral to a medical health service for support due to stress, depression and the risk of relapsing back into alcohol abuse. None of these interventions, on its face, involves the provision of treatment for the mental condition of alcohol related organic brain damage. 

20In my opinion, it was well open to his Honour to conclude that there was a lack of evidence of an essential pre-condition. The application pursuant to s 32 was correctly dismissed. 

21His Honour also rejected the application on the discretionary basis under s 32(1)(b). This conclusion is interlinked with his Honour's finding in respect of the pre-condition. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to separately consider the application of s 32(1)(b). 

22I make the following Orders: 

1. The amended summons is dismissed. 

2. Each party is to bear his own costs.

2708551,R v James DEAN-WILLCOCKS [2012] NSWSC 107,"Judgment  1On 10 October 2009, James Dean-Willcocks killed Magno Alvarado in Elouera Road, Cronulla, NSW.  2He did so, having encountered him randomly on the footpath of Elouera Road, by chasing and assaulting him and then finally, by pursuing him along the footpath, tackling him forcibly from the rear, causing him to fall to the concrete footpath.  There, whilst Mr Alvarado was prone and not moving, he body-slammed him on two occasions.  3The assault, tackling and body-slamming caused multiple fractures of Mr Alvarado's skull, multiple lacerations and abrasions, serious brain injury and serious neck and rib injuries.  He did not recover and later that day, died in St George Hospital without regaining consciousness.  4Mr Dean-Willcocks was arrested at about 6am on 10 October 2009, and has been in custody ever since.  He was charged with murder.  5On 28 September 2010, at the Local Court, Mr Dean-Willcocks offered to plead guilty to manslaughter.  The Crown declined that offer.  6On 26 October 2011, when indicted in front of the jury, Mr Dean-Willcocks pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, but guilty of the offence of manslaughter.  The Crown again declined to accept his plea in full discharge of the indictment.  7The trial proceeded to Monday 7 November 2011, when the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.  8It is now time for Mr Dean-Willcocks to be sentenced for his crime.  9The Crimes Act 1900 provides a maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of manslaughter of imprisonment for 25 years.  There is no standard non-parole period fixed by legislation.  Judicial Task on Sentencing  10In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself of the judicial task on sentencing.  11In the present system of criminal justice, I must exercise a discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon Mr Dean-Willcocks by applying well identified principles of law to the facts which I find: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at 1-2.  12The principles of law are well established and are conveniently summarised in the following way:  ""1. Where, following a trial by jury, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the power and responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender rest with the judge, and not with the jury...;  2. Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing.  Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings ...;  3. The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision-making ... is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury ...;  4. A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt ...;  5. There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender...  However, the practical effect of 4 above, in a given case, may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender ..."".  R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378; see also Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; 209 CLR 1.  13The appropriate approach to sentencing is to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentencing, identify their significance with the particular circumstances of the offence and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence having regard to the purpose for which a sentence is to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154 at [26].  14I will apply these principles in the course of this sentence.  The Relevant Legislation  15The Parliament of NSW has determined the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender.  Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that those purposes are:  ""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,  (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,  (c) to protect the community from the offender,  (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,  (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,  (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,  (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""  16Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets out the relevant provisions that deal with sentencing procedures generally.  Of particular importance are the terms of s 21A, which relevantly are as follows:  "" 21A Aggravating, mitigating and other factors in sentencing  (1) General  In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters:  (a) the aggravating factors referred to in subsection (2) that are relevant and known to the court,  (b) the mitigating factors referred to in subsection (3) that are relevant and known to the court,  (c) any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence.  The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law.  (2) Aggravating factors  The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:  (a)   ...  (b) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence,  ...  (g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial,  (h)  the offence was motivated by hatred for or prejudice against a group of people to which the offender believed the victim belonged (such as people of a particular religion, racial or ethnic origin, language, sexual orientation or age, or having a particular disability),  ...  (l) the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim's occupation (such as a taxi driver, bus driver or other public transport worker, bank teller or service station attendant),  ...  The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.  (3) Mitigating factors  The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:  (a) ...  (b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity,  ...  (e) the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions,  (f) the offender was a person of good character,  (g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend,  (h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise,  (i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:  (i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and  (ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both),  ...  (k) a plea of guilty by the offender,  (l) the degree of pre-trial disclosure by the defence (as provided by section 22A),  (4) The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so.  (5) The fact that any such aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence.""  Principles of Sentencing  17The courts have developed clear guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge.  These common law principles are to be found in decided cases.  18In summary, the common law principles include:  (a)proportionality - namely that the sentence should be proportionate to the gravity of the offences: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 472 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ;  (b)parity - namely, that any difference between sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence, ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, and to give the appearance that justice has not been done: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 617 per Dawson J, Gibbs CJ and Wilson J agreeing;  (c)totality - namely, that when a person stands for sentence for a number of offences, the Court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and determine what the appropriate sentence is for all of the offences: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ;  (d)avoidance of double punishment - namely that a person should not be punished twice for the same conduct: Pearce v The Queen [1988] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610.  19The importance of these principles is that s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act preserves the entire body of judicially developed sentencing principles: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [56]-[57]; Muldrock at [18].  20As well, factors established by the common law as affecting sentence, such as whether prison may be particularly burdensome, are also to be taken into account in accordance with s 21A: Muldrock at [19].  The Facts  21I find the facts of the matter to be as follows.  22Mr Dean-Willcocks was born on 9 October 1986.  Accordingly, he had just turned 23 at the time he killed Mr Alvarado.  Mr Alvarado was a complete stranger to him and there is no evidence to suggest that they had ever seen each other before this day.  23Prior to October 2009, Mr Dean-Willcocks lived at home with his parents at Illawong.  He was employed as a carpenter at Harbour Port Consulting Pty Ltd at Cronulla.  He started working there during 2006 as a general bridge and wharf carpenter, and became the manager of its pontoon manufacturing factory.  24He regularly socialised with a group of young people from the Cronulla area.  It was apparently his regular habit to go out on a weekend with various members of the group.  When he did so, he was accustomed to drinking between 12 and 15 stubbies of full strength beer.  This consumption did not usually lead to him showing any signs of significant intoxication.  25On 9 October 2009, it was decided to celebrate Mr Dean-Willcocks' 23 rd birthday and the birthdays of two other of his social companions.  They planned to head into the central business district of Sydney where a hotel room in Bond Street had been booked.  26Mr Dean-Willcocks completed work in the ordinary fashion.  Because it was his birthday, his employer gave him an additional $40 by way of wages so that he could celebrate by purchasing a carton of beer.  After work, he returned home to the family home at Illawong.  There he consumed, according to what he told the police, about four full strength beers.  27He was then driven to an apartment of a friend of his, Mr Jack Barnier, which was in Elouera Road.  28Although various of the participants in the social group arrived at different times, it appears likely that Mr Dean-Willcocks arrived at about 5.30pm.  There he consumed some further full strength beer.  Estimates varied as to the quantity which he consumed, but I am satisfied that he consumed at least three stubbies of full strength beer.  29There was also in the premises, and available for use, a drug called ""speed"".  Although it is not clear precisely when Mr Dean-Willcocks partook of that particular drug, I am satisfied from the blood tests which took place after the assaults, and whilst Mr Dean-Willcocks was in custody, that he must either at Mr Barnier's place or in the CBD, have consumed some of the speed.  However, I accept Dr Perl's evidence that the drugs which Mr Dean-Willcocks had consumed had no effect whatsoever upon him and had no causal relationship to the events which occurred.  30Mr Dean-Willcocks, in the company of others, left Mr Barnier's apartment at about 7pm and proceeded to Bond Street in the CBD.  Mr Dean-Willcocks arrived at that hotel room at 7.30pm.  He remained there until about 4am on the following morning.  31During his time in the hotel room, Mr Dean-Willcocks commenced drinking full strength beer, probably in the order of five or six stubbies.  Thereafter he commenced drinking Southern Comfort from the 1.1 litre bottle, which he had purchased en route to the city.  Some of the spirits that he drank were mixed with Coca Cola.  At other times, he was seen to be drinking the spirits neat without any mixer.  It is undoubted that he consumed a great deal of alcohol and probably most of the bottle of spirits, although it is not possible to make a definitive finding as to precisely how much of the bottle was consumed by him.  32By about 12.30am on 10 October 2009, Mr Dean-Willcocks was well affected by alcohol.  By that time he was having a great deal of difficulty standing up and moving properly.  He was stumbling and bumping into walls, spilling drinks on himself and elsewhere in the room and he had knocked a large wall mirror and a bedside table lamp.  He then collapsed onto a couch in the room and passed out.  He was deeply asleep from about 1am to about 4am.  33At about 4am he awoke and attempted to go to the bathroom.  He was unable to do so by himself and required assistance.  He was stumbling, slurring his words and was observed to be extremely drunk and was making a degree of noise and being generally oppositional.  34It was decided amongst a number of his friends, in particular Mr Aaron Brooker and Mr Jack Barnier, that they should take Mr Dean-Willcocks back to Cronulla.  He was in no fit state to be taken home to his parents' house at Illawong and accordingly, it was decided that he should go back to Jack Barnier's unit in Elouera Road to recover from his intoxicated state.  35A little after 4.30am, Mr Dean-Willcocks left the hotel room.  He was supported on the arms of Aaron Brooker and Jack Barnier.  As he approached the lift, he was seen to fall over, pulling Chloe Barnes down on top of him.  He was then helped into the lift.  The CCTV footage of the group of four leaving the hotel shows that Mr Dean-Willcocks was unsteady on his feet and he needed to be led by the hand from the building into the street.  36A taxi was hailed and Mr Dean-Willcocks and his three companions were driven to Cronulla.  37The taxi was directed to pull up in Elouera Road and did so at a point about 200 metres or so south of Mr Barnier's apartment.  All of the passengers left the taxi.  Mr Dean-Willcocks was observed to be slow in leaving the taxi and having difficulty in getting out of it.  It is likely that he was holding a bottle of beer, which fell to the ground and shattered on the road surface as he alighted from the taxi.  38Mr Brooker and Ms Barnes commenced walking back to Mr Barnier's unit, and Mr Barnier and Mr Dean-Willcocks followed about 10 metres or so behind.  During the course of that short walk, Mr Barnier stopped to relieve himself and lost sight of Mr Dean-Willcocks.  The other two also lost sight of him and the three continued back to Mr Barnier's apartment believing that Mr Dean-Willcocks would meet them there.  They did not see him again prior to his arrest.  39Mr Dean-Willcocks made his way along the western footpath of Elouera Road, which runs in generally north/south direction.  Near 117 Elouera Road, which is the block of apartments adjacent to the intersection of Bourke Road and Elouera Road, Mr Dean-Willcocks encountered the deceased, Mr Magno Alvarado.  There then began a sequence of events, which it is necessary to describe, which culminated in the death of Mr Alvarado.  40Mr Alvarado was a man in his late 60s.  It was his habit to rise early in the morning and wander the streets of Cronulla collecting items at random such as crushed aluminium cans, sifting through sand to see what he could find and generally in an entirely harmless manner, following his peripatetic ways.  Any items of potential value were sent back to the Philippines to be sold at markets there.  The moneys received were used for the benefit of Mr Alvarado's relatives in the Philippines.  41On that morning, Mr Alvarado was dressed in about five layers of clothing on his upper body.  He was carrying a soft blue cloth bag in which there was a large strainer or sieve.  42I am satisfied that the initial confrontation which occurred outside 117 Elouera Road related to the blue bag because one of the residents of 119 Elouera Road heard an exchange between two men in which one yelled "" give it back "" and "" you're not going anywhere "".  This appeared to come from outside 117 Elouera Road.  43From where Mr Alvarado and Mr Dean-Willcocks were, outside 117 Elouera Road, they went from the footpath to the area of the parked cars in front of 119 Elouera Road.  Mr Dean-Willcocks chased Mr Alvarado around those cars at a time when Mr Alvarado was yelling at him to leave him alone and go away.  44Mr Alvarado ran out onto the road and tried to flag a passing car down and seek help from the occupant of that car.  The car did not stop but rather drove around Mr Alvarado, who had tripped on the road surface, tooting its horn.  45The chasing and struggle continued in front of 119 Elouera Road.  There was a struggle between the two men.  Mr Dean-Willcocks was heard to yell out "" fuck off Japanese cunt, fuck off back to Japan "".  Mr Alvarado was heard to call out for help.  At that time I am satisfied that Mr Dean-Willcocks was attacking Mr Alvarado.  He had hold of him by his outside jacket.  He was punching him and throwing him to the ground.  When this scuffle was interrupted by the yelling of the occupants of 119 Elouera Road, Mr Alvarado, in an attempt to escape from Mr Dean-Willcocks, ran to where the cars were parked and again tried to place a car between himself and Mr Dean-Willcocks.  46He was pursued further south by Mr Dean-Willcocks onto Elouera Road where he was tackled and a struggle ensued.  At that time Mr Joshua Doyle, a most impressive witness, was driving his car along Elouera Road and came across the two men struggling on the road.  47I accept Mr Doyle's evidence of what then occurred.  It involved the following:  (a)A struggle on the ground with the two men rolling around.  Mr Dean-Willcocks managed to roll on top of Mr Alvarado, created a distance between them and then threw three punches which connected with Mr Alvarado's face.  (b)Mr Doyle alighted from his vehicle, went to the two men and in an assertive manner, spoke to them and tried to break up the fight.  This took a number of attempts.  (c)He spoke with Mr Dean-Willcocks and said "" What's going on mate "".  Mr Dean-Willcocks responded "" You don't understand, he's Japanese "".  Mr Dean-Willcocks repeated this statement on a number of occasions.  (d)As that was happening, Mr Alvarado slowly got off the ground and started to walk off towards the western footpath, then turned and headed in a southerly direction.  There was another man, apparently on his way to work, who was walking south along that footpath from whom I am satisfied Mr Alvarado sought help.  (e)Mr Alvarado having asked the man who was apparently on his way to work for help, and being ignored, then screamed out "" help, help, help me "".  (f)As that happened, Mr Dean-Willcocks suddenly turned, and ran off the road and towards Mr Alvarado.  He did so by running through the cars then turning left onto the footpath.  (g)Mr Doyle followed and by the time he arrived on the footpath and looked south he observed, about 20-25 metres along the footpath, Mr Alvarado lying on the ground as was Mr Dean-Willcocks.  (h)He then saw Mr Dean-Willcocks stand up and perform what he described as a "" full body-slam "" on Mr Alvarado.  He meant that Mr Dean-Willcocks jumped into the air and with the full force of his elbow and body, slammed down on the prostrate Mr Alvarado.  (i)This was repeated one more time with somewhat less force.  48It is apparent from other evidence of eyewitnesses, in particular Mr Abdelmessiah, that Mr Dean-Willcocks ran along the footpath after Mr Alvarado, approached him from behind and tackled him around the waist and top of his legs.  Mr Alvarado who had been looking back over his shoulder to see where Mr Dean-Willcocks was, fell to the ground and hit the back or side of his head on the footpath.  This was a hard collision, because a number of witnesses described what they heard as a "" crack "" as Mr Alvarado's head hit the concrete footpath.  49I am satisfied that the most serious injury which resulted in a skull fracture, extensive subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhage and brain injury which led to death, was occasioned when Mr Alvarado's head struck the footpath when he was tackled by Mr Dean-Willcocks.  I am also satisfied that the other principal injuries to Mr Alvarado's neck and ribs occurred when Mr Dean-Willcocks performed his two body-slams onto Mr Alvardo's body whilst he lay motionless on the footpath.  50As Mr Doyle rendered assistance to Mr Alvarado, Mr Dean-Willcocks walked away, heading north along the footpath.  When Mr Doyle called out for him to be detained by some of the neighbours who had arrived on the footpath, Mr Dean-Willcocks commenced running quite fast and hard in that direction, I infer, intending to go to Mr Barnier's apartment.  He was tackled, brought to the ground and restrained until the police arrived.  51Mr Alvarado was taken to St George Hospital.  He never regained consciousness and died later that day.  Intoxication Evidence  52The observations of those who saw the events on Elouera Road were that Mr Dean-Willcocks was intoxicated.  Those observers variously commented that he was unsteady on his feet, he was slurring his words, what he said made no sense and he was clearly behaving in an irrational manner.  53The police who arrested Mr Dean-Willcocks observed that he was very intoxicated.  When he was taken back to Miranda Police Station, he came under the care of Leading Senior Constable Lochrin, who was the custody manager at Miranda Police Station.  54Mr Lochrin was an impressive witness and I am satisfied that he was able accurately to assess Mr Dean-Willcocks' state of sobriety.  He formed the view that, upon his arrival at the police station, Mr Dean-Willcocks was well affected by alcohol, he was having difficulty standing unaided, his speech was considerably slurred and it was not appropriate for him to be interviewed.  55Mr Lochrin placed Mr Dean-Willcocks into a ""time-out"" which prevented the investigation team from carrying on their investigations involving Mr Dean-Willcocks and suspended the running of time.  56At about 7.55am, Mr Lochrin spoke to Mr Dean-Willcocks.  He observed that his speech was still very slurred and his eyelids were drooping heavily.  He was again observed at 9.33am and Mr Lochrin formed the opinion that Mr Dean-Willcocks was still somewhat groggy from the residual presence of alcohol and lack of sleep.  It was not until 10am that Mr Lochrin permitted the investigation to continue.  57I am satisfied that at the time of the events in Elouera Road, Mr Dean-Willcocks was well intoxicated and his conduct was affected by that intoxication.  Dr Perl, an expert pharmacologist, expressed the opinion, which I accept, that at about the time of the incident, the likely blood alcohol concentration of Mr Dean-Willcocks was between 0.165 grams per 100 millilitres and 0.355 grams per 100 millilitres.  Dr Perl agreed that, as Mr Dean-Willcocks was a young, fit male who was accustomed to drinking heavily, and therefore had a high tolerance to alcohol, it was likely that he would have been at the upper end of that range.  58I am satisfied that at the time he assaulted and tackled Mr Alvarado, that Mr Dean-Willcocks' blood alcohol concentration was likely to be no less than 0.3 grams per 100 millilitres of blood.  This is a very high level.  It is six times the legal limit for driving a motor vehicle and twice the limit for the offence of high range PCA.  59I am satisfied that at the time of the offence, as Dr Perl opined, Mr Dean-Willcocks was extremely intoxicated, that he had a significant cognitive impairment and that, so disrupted were his mental processes, it is unlikely that the consequences of what he was doing were a factor in his consideration.  I am satisfied that his cognitive function was severely impaired and his processing skills were also severely impaired.  60It was in that state that Mr Dean-Willcocks attacked Mr Alvarado, wholly without justification, and then persisted in chasing him and bringing him to the ground whilst uttering racial slurs which were wholly unjustified.  61Mr Dean-Willcocks' intoxication is an explanation for what occurred.  It does not justify it.  He did not attempt to justify what he did.  62Mr Dean-Willcocks has no memory of the offence or of the period surrounding it.  Procedural History  63Mr Dean-Willcocks was taken to the Miranda Police Station and, after the ""time-out"" previously described, was interviewed.  That interview was recorded electronically.  He told the police officers that he had no recollection of what occurred, he was quite unclear as to how he had returned from the city to Cronulla and when confronted with a version of events and asked for a comment, he accepted the description of what had occurred and described himself as being a "" dickhead "".  64After the police learned of the death of Mr Alvarado, Mr Dean-Willcocks was charged with his murder.  Mr Dean-Willcocks has been in custody since 10 October 2009.  65At trial, Mr Dean-Willcocks pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the basis that, such was the extent of his intoxication, that he did not form any specific intention to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Alvarado and accordingly was not guilty of murder.  Mr Dean-Willcocks accepted that he had assaulted Mr Alvarado, that the assault was unlawful, that the tackle which he carried out on Mr Alvarado was both unlawful and dangerous and that his conduct had occasioned the death of Mr Alvarado.  He therefore pleaded guilty to manslaughter.  66I am satisfied, consistent with the jury's verdict that Mr Dean-Willcocks did not have any specific intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Alvarado.  I am satisfied that he engaged in unlawful and dangerous conduct, which conduct caused the death of Mr Alvarado.  Aggravating Features  67As stated at [16], section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act identifies a number of matters as aggravating factors to which regard must be had in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  68The first which is relevant to this matter, is that the offence involved the actual use of violence: see s 21A(2)(b).  However, given the nature of the crime, I am satisfied that this aggravating factor is accounted for as being an element of the offence and that I should not have additional regard to it.  69The second matter is whether the injury caused by the offence was substantial: s 21A(2)(g).  Again, this is not an aggravating matter to which I ought have any additional regard.  70A particular aggravating feature which the legislation calls attention in s 21A(2)(h), is whether the offence was  ""...motivated by hatred for or prejudice against a group of people to which the offender believed the victim belonged, such as people of a particular ... racial or ethnic origin ...""  71Although the offence was committed whilst Mr Dean-Willcocks was heavily intoxicated, I am satisfied that the motivation for this otherwise senseless attack is to be found in what he called out from time to time whilst he was assaulting, scuffling with, chasing and tackling Mr Alvarado.  Mr Dean-Willcocks obviously formed the opinion that Mr Alvarado was a Japanese or Asian man.  His racial abuse of Mr Alvarado, yelling out that he ought to go back to Japan and leave Australia, as well as his justification to Mr Doyle namely, "" you don't understand, he's Japanese "", leave me in no doubt that this was an offence motivated by prejudice against people from Japan or perhaps more generally from Asia.  This is an aggravating feature of the conduct that I will take into account.  72During the course of his submissions on sentence, senior counsel for Mr Dean-Willcocks submitted that, having regard to the evidence given on sentence, I should not be persuaded that Mr Dean-Willcocks' conduct was racially motivated.  The evidence on sentence was clear, namely, that prior to the attack on Mr Alvarado, Mr Dean-Willcocks had not demonstrated, either by his conduct, or his words, any hint of racism, or being anti-Japanese or anti-Asian.  His words, and conduct, on that morning were said to be aberrant and completely out of character.  73Whilst I accept that Mr Dean-Willcocks was not a person who acted or spoke contrary to the interests of any racial group, that does not tell against, on this occasion, his being motivated by hatred or prejudice against a specific racial group.  The persistent use by him of racially directed comments whilst assaulting Mr Alvarado leaves no real room for debate that what he was doing was racially motivated.  74I am unable to convincingly rationalise why there is such a difference of Mr Dean-Willcocks' attitude.  I do not believe that I am obliged to.  Perhaps it was the extent of his inebriation that led him to make the comments which he did.  After all, as his senior counsel accepted in submissions, it has been at least since Pliny the Elder wrote his encyclopaedic work Naturalis Historia in AD 77-79, that the phrase "" in vino veritas "" has been used to explain the appearance of unexpected behaviour in inebriated individuals.  However that may be, I am simply not in a position to satisfactorily rationalise all of the evidence on this issue.  75Another aggravating factor to which the legislation calls attention is that the victim was a vulnerable person, for example, that the victim was very old: see s 21A(2)(l).  It is not essential for the application of this aggravating factor for the victim to be "" very old "".  What is necessary is that the Court makes a determination as to whether the victim was a vulnerable person or not.  76I am satisfied that Mr Alvarado was a vulnerable victim.  He was in his late sixties.  He was clearly not an agile man.  He was wandering the streets in a peripatetic fashion, collecting items which to him appeared to be of value, but which to the objective observer were of no value at all.  He was a harmless, completely inoffensive individual seeking out meagre pleasure on the streets of Cronulla in the early morning.  He was entirely vulnerable.  He was picked on, in my judgment, in part because of this vulnerability.  He was an easy target.  This is an aggravating feature of Mr Dean-Willcocks' behaviour to which I will have regard.  Mitigating Features  77There are a number of mitigating factors identified by s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to which I am required to have regard and to which I do.  They are:  (a)that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(3)(b).  I am satisfied that the offence had no feature of planning or organised criminal activity.  It was entirely opportunistic.  This, in the particular circumstances, has only a small mitigatory effect.  (b)that the offender had no prior criminal convictions and was a person of good character: ss 21A(3)(e) and 21A(3)(f).  Here, Mr Dean-Willcocks had a prior conviction for mid-range PCA in 2007.  I do not regard that conviction to be of any relevance to the offence for which sentence is being passed.  The Crown accepted that Mr Dean-Willcocks was otherwise of good character.  There was unchallenged evidence from his employer, Mr Craig Turner, that that was so.  I accept that prior to this offence, Mr Dean-Willcocks was of good character and I take this mitigating factor into account.  (c)Mr Dean-Willcocks' prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of reoffending: ss 21A(3)(g) and 21A(3)(h).  Having regard to all of the circumstances, and in particular the extent of intoxication, Mr Dean-Willcocks' age and immaturity, and his acceptance of both criminal and moral responsibility for what he has done, I am satisfied that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and that there is only a slight chance of any reoffending in the future; and  (d)remorse: where an offender has shown remorse that can mitigate any sentence: s 21A(3)(i).  I am satisfied by his plea of guilty to manslaughter which was entered at a reasonably early opportunity, that Mr Dean-Willcocks has shown true remorse and that he is entitled to the benefit of that remorse.  I also accept his evidence, and that of his father before me to like effect.  (e)plea of guilty: s 21A(k).  This will be discussed later at [91].  Seriousness of the Offence  78The courts have recognised for many years that sentencing for the crime of manslaughter is a difficult task.  That is because the range of conduct which can result in the death of an individual is very great.  In all cases of manslaughter, matters of fact and degree arise.  Views as to the relative importance of particular facts and matters will undoubtedly differ.  79However, one principle which is important for a sentencing judge to always keep in mind when considering the crime of manslaughter is that the starting point for consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in assessing the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case, is that what is involved in this case, and in every case of manslaughter, is the felonious taking of a human life:  See R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA, 12 December 1995, unreported), per Gleeson CJ.  80Manslaughter, as an unlawful homicide, however it occurs, has always been regarded by the law as a most serious crime.  That is because the protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice:  See R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, per Gleeson CJ (James and Ireland JJ agreeing).  81In my opinion, the criminality involved here was serious.  The general course of conduct followed by Mr Dean-Willcocks leading up to the tackle was opportunistic and unplanned.  82I am satisfied, consistent with the jury's verdict, that I should find that this was a thoughtless act committed whilst Mr Dean-Willcocks was heavily intoxicated.  Mr Dean-Willcocks did not intend to cause Mr Alvarado any serious physical injury by tackling him.  It was a cowardly, senseless, stupid and entirely unnecessary attack.  83As I have already said, manslaughter is regarded as a most serious offence.  But in the circumstances of this matter,  I am persuaded that the conduct of Mr Dean-Willcocks demonstrated a degree of immaturity, and the effects of his heavy intoxication with alcohol.  84I accept, as the jury must have, that Mr Dean-Willcocks never thought that his actions would cause really serious physical injury to Mr Alvarado.  But what he did was dangerous and unlawful.  He sought to express his emotions with violence.  It resulted in the death of Mr Alvarado.  Subjective Features  85Mr Dean-Willcocks was just 23 years old at the time of the offence.  He was raised in a family consisting of his parents and three siblings.  He had a good relationship with his family.  He was educated at both primary and secondary school until the end of Year 10.  86He found a variety of employment positions having left school.  By the age of about 19 or 20, he commenced working as a bridge and wharf carpenter in the business in which he was working at the time of the offence.  He was regarded as a good worker and after a period of time he was engaged in the task of managing the pontoon manufacturing workshop.  87Mr Dean-Willcocks was regarded as a responsible employee and one who could both manage deadlines demanded by work and also his fellow workers.  He was not known to be aggressive or violent whilst at work.  His employer has offered to re-employ him if his business exists at the time of his release from prison.  88Since his arrest, and whilst in custody, he has undergone a number of courses to deal with his alcohol abuse and anger management issues.  89Prior to the offence, it is clear that Mr Dean-Willcocks was accustomed to drinking very heavily, but mainly on the weekends.  He seemed to take alcohol on most days of the week but not always to excess.  He was, in my judgment, an alcoholic.  90The evidence satisfies me that since his arrest and whilst he has been in custody, Mr Dean-Willcocks has been well supported by his family with whom he seems to have a continuing close and supportive relationship.  They will help his rehabilitation upon his release from prison.  Early Plea of Guilty  91On 28 September 2010, in the Local Court, during a case conference, Mr Dean-Willcocks indicated that he was prepared to plead guilty to manslaughter on the basis, seemingly, that his level of intoxication meant that he did not have the necessary specific intention to constitute the crime of murder.  That is, he did not have the intention to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Alvarado.  He accepted then, as he has at all times since, that he did engage in an unlawful and/or dangerous act which caused Mr Alvarado's death.  The Crown rejected Mr Dean-Willcocks' offer and accordingly he was tried for murder before the jury.  92The case conference was conducted in accordance with the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008.  Both the Crown and senior counsel for Mr Dean-Willcocks agreed that the effect of these statutory provisions, in the events which have happened, is to require the Court, when imposing a sentence of imprisonment for a term, to give a discount of 25 per cent on the term which would otherwise have been imposed.  93However, even if the Act did not apply, and I was dealing with the usual sentencing principles, I would have arrived at the same result.  94Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that in passing sentence, a court must take into account a plea of guilty and some associated circumstances.  However, the legislation requires that any lesser penalty imposed must:  ""... not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.""  95The nature of this crime does not call for either the maximum sentence, or such a long sentence, that any discount is inappropriate.  The two exceptions enunciated by Spigelman CJ in R v Thomson ; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 at [157] and [158] have no application to the circumstances of this offence.  96It is entirely appropriate to recognise the offer to plead guilty which, if accepted, would have achieved a utilitarian benefit for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole.  The matter was still in the Local Court and had the plea been accepted, it would have been a substantial benefit to the administration of justice in NSW.  97Mr Dean-Willcocks adhered to the plea on subsequent occasions and in particular upon arraignment in this Court and then when indicted before the jury.  98Had the plea been accepted in those circumstances by the Crown, a discount of 25 per cent would have been appropriate.  As Grove J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreed, said in R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 at [15] having regard to the then relevant legislation:  ""There has been a long practice, however, in this court and in trial courts to take into account the offer of a plea of guilty which matches the crime for which a person is ultimately convicted.""  See also: R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129 at [37]-[43] per Bell J, Giles JA and Carruthers AJ agreeing; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32] per Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing).  99Such an approach seems to me to accord with the incentive and the public interest benefit which underlay the provision of a discount for an early plea: see Thomson at [115] and [122] per Spigelman CJ.  100Accordingly, I am satisfied either by application of the statute, or else by application of sentencing principles, that in this case it is appropriate to allow a 25 per cent discount for Mr Dean-Willcocks' offer to plead guilty to manslaughter and to his subsequent plea of guilty to that offence.  Victim Impact Statement  101The effect which Mr Dean-Willcocks' conduct has had on Mr Alvarado's son and grandson has been expressed by Mr Nelson Alvarado in his victim impact statement which was read aloud to the Court.  I acknowledge the contents of this statement.  I express my sympathy to Mr Nelson Alvarado and his son for their tragic and senseless loss.  102I will have regard, in fixing the appropriate sentence, to that statement in the way in which the law allows me: s 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ; R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.  Custodial Conditions  103The unchallenged evidence before the Court on sentence was that Mr Dean-Willcocks is presently serving his time in custody in protection as a result of at least one assault upon him.  It was also accepted that the conditions under which Mr Dean-Willcocks is presently serving his sentence are more restrictive and more harsh for him than if he were to serve his term of imprisonment in the mainstream.  104It is submitted on his behalf, which I accept, that he is likely to serve the balance of his time in custody with the same restrictions.  105This is a matter to which I am entitled, and will, have regard, as a relevant matter to consider when determining the length of any non-parole period which I impose.  Sentence  106Mr Dean-Willcocks is a relatively young man.  He was of good character, reasonably educated and an apparently responsible individual who was in good employment.  His prospects of rehabilitation are good.  They will be enhanced if he refrains from drinking alcohol and taking illicit drugs.  107Since his crime involved the taking of a life, any sentence which I impose must mark out the Court's obligation to protect life and mark its disapproval of any crime in which a life is lost.  General deterrence is, in this case, a matter of importance.  108But it would not be right to crush all hope of rehabilitation, which is a matter to which I must also give proper account.  109Ordinarily, but for the plea of guilty, I would have sentenced Mr Dean-Willcocks to a term of imprisonment of 10 years.  In light of the fact of his plea offer, that term will be reduced by 25 per cent.  110Mr Dean-Willcocks, for the offence of manslaughter of Mr Alvarado, taking into account your plea of guilty, I will sentence you to an overall term of 7 years and 6 months.  111Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires, as a statutory ratio, that you should serve three-quarters of that term as a non-parole period.  112However, in your case, I am satisfied that there are special circumstances which enable me to reduce that non-parole period, thereby increasing the period of time you are on parole, because that would be beneficial for the purpose of your rehabilitation and in particular any treatment which you may obtain to deal with your excessive drinking.  113The special circumstances which I find are the fact that you are still a relatively young man, the fact that this is your first period of incarceration and you will require a lengthy period of supervision in the community in order to ensure that your rehabilitation has good prospects of success.  114These facts all combine to mean that I should vary the ratio of 75 per cent fixed by the law so that your non-parole period is about 55 per cent of the total sentence, which means that I have decided that you should serve a period in custody of 4 years.  That term should commence on 10 October 2009, which was the day you were taken into custody for this offence.  115I am satisfied that such a non-parole period properly reflects the criminality involved in this offence and all of the factors to which I am required to have regard.  116Mr Dean-Willcocks, I impose the following sentence upon you:  (a)I sentence you to a term of imprisonment without parole, of 4 years, to commence on 10 October 2009 and to conclude on 9 October 2013.  (b)I sentence you to a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months, to conclude on 9 April 2017.  (c)The first day on which you will be eligible for release from custody is 9 October 2013.  **********

		24 February 2012",2012-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708558,Rian Lane v Dive Two Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 104,"Judgment 

Introduction 

1The plaintiff, Mr Lane, claims damages against the defendants, Dive Two Pty Ltd ( Dive Two ) and Mr Todd, in respect of injuries he sustained when a boat driven by Mr Todd collided with a boat from which the plaintiff was fishing. 

2The defendants claim an entitlement to indemnity or damages from the second cross-defendant ( Liberty ), their insurer. In the event that Liberty is not obliged to indemnify them in respect of the plaintiff's claim, the defendants claim damages against the first cross-defendant ( Horsell ), the broker who arranged their insurance, for negligence and breach of contract. 

Matters for determination 

3By the second day of the hearing of this matter, the claim by the plaintiff against the defendants had resolved. Consequently, I ordered judgment on 7 February 2012 for a specified sum in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants and noted that both cross-defendants accepted that the judgment sum was reasonable. 

4Accordingly the matters that remained to be determined related to the defendants' cross-claim against Horsell and Liberty. The sums claimed are: 

(1)the amount of the judgment given in favour of the plaintiff in these proceedings and the plaintiff's costs as agreed or assessed; 

(2)compensation paid in respect of damage to the boat with which the defendants' boat collided, which the evidence establishes amounts to $5,500; and 

(3)legal costs which Mr Todd paid for representation at the Raymond Terrace Local Court in respect of criminal charges arising from the collision, which the evidence establishes amounts to $11,275, including counsel's fees of $4,750. 

5Liberty contends that it is not liable to indemnify the defendants under the insurance contract for two reasons: 

(1)the claim does not fall within the contract's insuring clause because it did not arise ""in connection with the Insured's Business""; 

(2)the claim is excluded by reason of exclusion clause 7.24 because: 

(a)it involved a criminal act as evidenced by the defendant's plea of guilty to the charge of negligent navigation occasioning grievous bodily harm in breach of the Crimes Act 1900 s 52B(3)(b); and 

(b)Mr Todd is not covered for his legal costs in relation to the criminal proceedings as he was not acting in the course of his duties at the time. 

6The defendants' claim against Horsell arises only if I find that the insuring clause does not cover the claim. If I make that finding, the question arises whether the failure of the cover to respond was as a result of any breach of retainer or negligence on the part of Horsell. Horsell denies that there was any relevant contract of retainer. It also denies breach and causation. 

The collision and subsequent events 

7The evidence in the proceedings comprised affidavits or statements of Mr Todd, Mr Duffy (on behalf of Horsell) and Mr Scales (on behalf of Liberty). Mr Todd and Mr Duffy were cross-examined. 

8The events surrounding the claim can be stated briefly. 

9At the time of the collision, the second defendant, Mr Todd, was the sole director of Dive Two. Dive Two carried on a scuba diving business trading as ""Dive One"", and owned a 7.45 metre aluminium dive vessel, which was also called Dive One. 

10On 29 July 2006, at 7.30 am, Mr Todd put Dive One into the water at Soldier's Point. He picked up a group of divers at 7.45 am. The first dive took place at Looking Glass, off Broughton Island, from 9.12 am until 10.00 am. Mr Todd then took the divers to Yacaaba Head in his boat for a surface interval pending the next dive, which took place at Cabbage Tree Island. The second dive commenced at 11.30 am and finished at 12.20 pm. Mr Todd returned the divers to Soldier's Point at 1.20 pm and then unloaded the dive gear before picking up his passengers for the afternoon's boat trip. The passengers on that trip were Mr and Mrs Todd and two other couples. In the late afternoon, Dive One collided with another vessel. The plaintiff, who was fishing from the other vessel, suffered serious injuries, including head injuries, as a result of the collision. 

11As a result, Mr Todd was charged with one count of dangerous navigation occasioning grievous bodily harm in breach of the Crimes Act 1900 s 52B(3)(b), details of which were recorded in the Court Attendance Notice as follows: 

""...between 4:00 pm and 5:50 pm on 29/07/2006 at Hawks Nest [Mr Todd] did dangerously navigate a vessel, to wit, 'Dive One' a 7.45 m aluminium dive vessel, when it was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to Rian Lane, and at the time of impact the said William Andrew Todd was navigating the vessel at a speed dangerous to other persons."" 

12He was also charged with a lesser charge of negligent navigation in breach of Water Traffic Regulations s 3(1). 

13On 6 November 2006, Mr Todd pleaded guilty to the dangerous navigation offence. It is common ground that this is the relevant offence for the purposes of determining whether exclusion clause 7.24 applies. He was sentenced on 24 September 2007 and required to enter a bond for two years. 

Terms of the insurance contract 

14There is an issue on the pleadings whether the insurance contract between Liberty and Dive Two is a contract of marine insurance (in which case the Marine Insurance Act 1909 (Cth) applies) or not (in which case the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) applies). Counsel for the parties agree that nothing turns on the characterisation of the contract for the purposes of these proceedings and therefore it is not necessary for me to determine the issue. 

15The Master Policy is nominally in three sections: A, B and C, although in substance it is in two: A & B and C. Sections A & B are a ""Combined General & Products & Professional Liability Policy"" whereas Section C governs indemnity for legal expenses. Where in these reasons I do not specifically refer to a section, it should be taken to be a reference to sections A & B. Where a clause is contained within Section C, specific reference will be made to Section C. 

16The relevant clauses of the Master Policy and its schedule are set out below. 

17Paragraph 2 of the Schedule provides: 

""INSURED: PADI Asia Pacific and individual members, dive centers and resorts and others as agreed"" 

18Paragraph 4 of the Schedule provides that the insured's business is as defined in the policy wording under ""Scuba Diving"". 

19Clause 1 provides that: 

""Subject to the terms of this Policy, LIU [Liberty] will pay to or on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally liable to pay by way of compensation as a result of a Claim(s) both first made against the Insured and notified to LIU during the period of Insurance for Injury and/or Damage in connection with the Insured's Business."" 

20Clause 2.11 defines ""Scuba Diving"" as: 

""...principally incorporating class and water based learning activities and modules including first aid training and certification, including the determination of standards by the accrediting agency and all activities relating to training, instructing, observing and control of recreational scuba diving. This includes all activities relating to snorkelling, skin diving, swimming, recreational surface supplied air to a maximum depth of 10 meters, servicing hiring and repairing of equipment and sales of related products, tours of reefs by Glass bottom boats (under 12 meters), transportations of people from one Island to another, bird watching, guided tours of Island when not diving, jungle &/or bush walking, fishing, underwater photography/video, what watching, scuba doos, beach games"" 

21Clause 3 provides that: 

""The indemnity granted by this Policy will extend to... Any director... of the Insured... but only while acting within the scope of their duties in such capacity..."" 

22Clause 7 provides, in part, that: 

""This Policy does not cover liability directly or indirectly caused by, arising out of or in any way connected with... 

7.18 Ownership, maintenance, operation, possession or use by or on behalf of the Insured of... 

7.18.2 Any watercraft which exceeds twelve metres in length... 

7.24 Any alleged or actual fraudulent, dishonest, malicious, wilful or criminal act or omission of the Insured or any person covered by Clause 3 of this Policy..."" 

23Clause 1 of Section C provides: 

""In consideration of payments of the Premium, Liberty International Underwriters (LIU) will provide Indemnity in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Section C 

1. Legal Expense Insurance Benefit 

Subject to the Limit of Indemnity, LIU will indemnify the Insured for Legal Costs and Expenses incurred by the Insured in the course of scuba diving and related activities at or in: ... 

1.2 Pleas of mitigation for a criminal defence against the Insured; or..."" 

24Clause 2.6 of Section C replicates the definition of ""Scuba Diving"" in 2.11 of Sections A & B. 

25Clause 3 of Section C provides: 

""LIU shall not be liable for claims in respect of: ... 

3.9 Legal services arising out of any dishonest, fraudulent, malicious or deliberate act or omission of the Insured. Provided that this exclusion 3.9 shall only apply where a judgment establishes that the Insured were guilty of any such dishonest, fraudulent, malicious or deliberate act or omission. In which case, any Legal Costs and Expenses, which may have been advanced to or on behalf of the Insured, shall be refundable by the Insured to LIU."" 

26Clause 4.5 of Section C provides: 

""Section C and the relevant part of the Combined General & Products Liability Policy shall be read together as one contract and any word or expression to which a specific meaning has been given shall bear such specific meaning wherever it may appear unless such meaning is clearly inapplicable in the context in which the word or expression appears; ..."" 

Were the activities engaged in by the defendants covered by the insurance policy? 

Construction of the insuring clause 

27There was considerable argument about the meaning of the insuring clause, and in particular, the ""Insured's Business"" which incorporated the definition of ""Scuba Diving"" in clause 2.11 for Sections A & B of the policy and clause 2.6 of Section C of the policy. 

The defendants' submissions on the construction of the insuring clause 

28Mr Birch, senior counsel for the defendants, submitted that the description of the insured's business by reference to the extended definition of scuba diving in clause 2.6 is a description of the business by reference to activities, rather than purposes. He submitted that there is no requirement that the listed activities be engaged in for the purposes of making a profit. Thus, he contended, if the insured had taken some children out for a snorkelling trip as a charitable act, it would fall within the insuring clause because the activity of snorkelling is referred to in the definition. 

29He contended that no particular significance ought be attached to the word ""Business"", in the context of ""Insured's Business"" since it was a defined term which referred the reader of the contract to the definition of ""Scuba Diving"". However, he accepted that if I considered there to be an ambiguity in the definition of that term, I could be guided by the fact that the words in the schedule were ""Insured's Business"". 

30Mr Birch submitted that the use of the words '""Scuba Diving"" means principally' indicates that the list of activities ought not be regarded as exhaustive but that the activities listed provide an indication of the related activities. He emphasised the breadth of the activities in the list, which includes: 

(1)transportation of people from one island to another; 

(2)bird-watching; 

(3)guided tours of the island when not diving; 

(4)jungle/ and or bushwalking; 

(5)fishing; 

(6)underwater photography/ video; and 

(7)whale-watching. 

31He also submitted that the specificity of the items suggests that they are examples only, since it could hardly have been contemplated that transportation of divers from one location on the coast to another, rather than to an island (even assuming that Australia can properly be regarded as an island) would not fall within the clause. 

32Mr Birch described the wording of clause 2.11 as ""clumsy"", since, if read literally, it includes activities ""relating"" to scuba diving but not scuba diving itself. He urged that the policy ought be given a sensible, commercial meaning. 

33He contended that the activity being conducted by Dive Two at the time of the accident was a sightseeing tour in the general vicinity of the area in which diving excursions were being undertaken by the company using the company's dive boat and usual boat skipper. This activity, he submitted, was an activity within the extended meaning of ""Scuba Diving"", as defined by clause 2.11. 

34In the alternative, Mr Birch submitted that it was an activity ""in connection with the Insured's Business"". Mr Birch said that although ultimately the question of whether there was a connection between a particular activity and the business was a question of fact and degree, I could comfortably find a connection in the instant case. 

35He listed the following factors as sufficient to establish such a connection: 

(1)the vessel used was the one used by the business for its usual dive boat operations; 

(2)the vessel was skippered by one of the business's usual dive boat operators; 

(3)the trip involved an activity of a sort in which the business usually engaged, namely sightseeing on the Myall River; and 

(4)the activity itself was likely to produce goodwill for the business among potential customers and this was a purpose for which Mr Todd embarked on the trip that rise rise to the claim. 

36Mr Birch relied on Mr Todd's evidence that the business also involved taking people out on leisure cruises which did not involve scuba diving. Indeed outside peak season Mr Todd said that he was conducting more whale-watching and sightseeing trips, including along the Myall River. He contended that Mr Todd's evidence was relevantly unchallenged on these matters and that therefore I could accept the evidence, even if I rejected Mr Todd's evidence about his subjective purpose of the trip. 

Horsell's submissions on the construction of the insuring clause 

37It is plain from the pleadings that Horsell had a similar, if not identical, interest to that of the defendants in establishing that the insuring clause covered the claim, since the defendants' claim against Horsell only arises if the insuring clause does not cover the claim. Mr Martin, senior counsel for Horsell, adopted Mr Birch's submissions set out above, but also made separate submissions on the question of construction. Because of the differences, some of them subtle, between the submissions of Mr Birch and those of Mr Martin, I propose to deal with them separately below. 

38Mr Martin submitted that the defendants' claim was ""in connection with the Insured's Business"", as contemplated by clause 1 because: 

(1)the expression ""Insured's Business"" as defined in the policy wording under ""Scuba Diving"" includes ""transportations of people from one Island to another""; 

(2)the trip was a boating activity which came within the scope of the ""Insured's Business"" as described in the Master Policy; 

(3)the trip was a boating activity which was ""in connection with the Insured's Business"" as described in the Master Policy; 

(4)the vessel ""Dive One"" was owned by Dive Two; 

(5)the vessel was being operated by Mr Todd, who was at the time the sole employee of Dive Two and its sole director and shareholder; and 

(6)one of the purposes of the trip was to promote the insured's business. 

39The list set out above essentially mirrors Mr Birch's arguments that the insurance policy lists activities as the touchstones of insurance cover. 

40Mr Martin submitted that the description of the insured's business in clause 2.11 of the Master Policy does not list all of the activities carried on by Professional Association of Diving Instructors ( PADI ) members in the course of their business. The purpose of the description was to identify the business and not to list its various activities. He submitted that the use of the word ""principally"" in the description confirms this. He contended that although ""boating"" is not, of itself, an activity contained in the list, recreational boating is naturally affiliated with recreational scuba diving and the other water-based activities included in the insuring clause to illustrate the scope of the insured's business. 

41Mr Martin submitted that the words used in the first sentence of the definition of ""Scuba Diving"" are descriptive of coverage; that is, a business that principally incorporated class and water based learning activities and modules and all activities relating to training, instructing, observing and control of recreational scuba diving. By contrast the second sentence of the definition illustrates, clarifies and extends the scope of coverage, but there is no reason to construe the word ""includes"" as being used so as to exhaustively identify the ambit of coverage provided by the policy. 

42Mr Martin eschewed the proposition that I should give any weight to the fact that the words ""Insured's Business"" appear in the Schedule or that the terms of the insuring clause contain the expression ""in connection with the Insured's Business"". He submitted that the effect of defining ""Insured's Business"" as ""Scuba Diving"" was to obliterate any significance being given to the words ""Insured's Business"". Mr Martin relied on the commentary and cases referred to at [5.11] of Lewison and Hughes, The Interpretation of Contracts in Australia (Law Book Co., 2012). As can be seen from my recitation of Mr Birch's argument set out above, Mr Martin went further than Mr Birch on this point, the latter having conceded that in the event of ambiguity I could have regard to the words ""Insured's Business"". 

43Mr Martin also contended that the expression ""Insured's Business"" as defined in the policy wording under ""Scuba Diving"" includes the ownership, maintenance, operation, possession or use by or on behalf of the insured of watercraft up to 12 metres in length. He submitted that this argument was open to him notwithstanding that I had refused his application for leave to amend Horsell's defence to the cross-claim (see Rian Lane v Dive Two Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 49) because it is a ""surrounding circumstance"" to which resort can be had in the event of an ambiguity in the contract. 

44He sought to establish that it was intended that what had formerly been an exception to the exclusion (boats up to 12 metres in length) amounted to an entirely separate, and additional, different ground of cover. 

45In support of his submission that the policy covers claims in relation to the use, operation and maintenance of watercraft of up to 12 metres, Mr Martin pointed to the following chronology of communications between Horsell and Liberty which preceded the issue of the relevant Master Policy, 03.02: 

(1)The Master Policy for the preceding period of insurance (2004/2005) contained the following exclusion clause: 

""7.18 Ownership, maintenance, operation, possession or use by or on behalf of the Insured of any aircraft, aerial device, watercraft or hovercraft."" 

(2)In 24 August 2005, Mr Paul Scales, the insurance underwriter for Liberty, sent an email to Mr Rob Veale at Horsell, attaching proposed renewal terms for the PADI Asia Pacific Watertight Insurance Programme ( the Quotation) which set out the proposed terms for the period of insurance from 30 September 2005 to 30 September 2006, including: 

""Wording: Liberty International Underwriters base form CLM03.02 plus Endorsements as expiring. 

Endorsements: 

1. ... 

2. Watercraft inclusion for craft up to 12 meters..."" 

(3)In late August or early September 2005 PADI forwarded to its members a brochure entitled ""2005/2006 PADI Asia Pacific Watertight Liability Insurance Programme"", which stated that the coverage for public and products liability included: ""Liability of watercraft up to 12 metres in length"". 

(4)On 26 September 2005 PADI forwarded to its members a letter dated that day ( the Renewal Letter ) which stated that some of the benefits of the program included: ""Cover for watercraft liability up to a maximum boat length of 12 metres"". 

(5)In response to the Renewal Letter, Dive Two activated its 2005/2006 insurance cover and paid the premium to Horsell. 

(6)On 31 October 2005 Horsell issued a Certificate of Insurance for the period from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2006. 

(7)Subsequently (on or about 6 March 2006) Mr Scales forwarded the Liberty 03.02 policy wording to Horsell ""in accordance with the wording in the Quotation"". 

(8)On or about 30 June 2006, Mr Scales signed, dated and placed Liberty's stamp on the Liberty 03.02 policy wording and hand delivered a copy of the policy to Horsell. 

46Finally, Mr Martin submitted that if the insurer proffers a document which is ambiguous, it, and not the insured, should bear the consequences of the ambiguity because the insurer is usually in the superior position to add a word or clause clarifying the promise of insurance which it is offering; in other words, the document is to be construed contra proferentem : Johnson v American Home Insurance Co (1998) 192 CLR 266 at 275, per Kirby J. 

47Mr Sexton, senior counsel for Liberty, submitted in response to Mr Martin, that there was no occasion for the contra proferentem rule of construction in this case. He pointed to the evidence that established that the wording for the definition of scuba diving was proffered by Horsell, as agent for the insured, not by Liberty. In the 2004/2005 policy, ""Insured's Business"" was defined in the Schedule as ""principally activities relating to scuba diving instruction, tours and transport, bird watching, guided tours of diving, fishing, and underwater photography/video"". On 25 July 2005, Horsell sent Liberty the Quotation Slip Prepared For PADI Asia Pacific which proposed ""extended coverage"" including ""transport of people from one island to another"" and ""guided tours of island when not diving"". Then on 30 June 2006 Mr Duffy, of Horsell, proffered the wording which became clause 2.11. 

48Mr Sexton relied on certain matters of ""background knowledge"" which were germane to the interpretation of particular contracts, including policies of insurance (as to the relevance of such matters, see El Hayek v Vasic [2010] NSWSC 634 at [32] - [34], per Garling J, affirmed sub nom QBE Insurance Australia Ltd v Vasic [2010] NSWCA 166). 

49The matters of background knowledge on which Mr Sexton relied were: 

(1)the policy was for members of a commercial organisation, PADI. It was not a policy for members of the public generally or for a broad range of users of watercraft. The policy was only available to PADI members and the membership of PADI comprised only persons and entities with a business or commercial interest in scuba diving which principally involved instruction; 

(2)the terms of this policy were not contained in a compulsory standard form, such as are found in, for example, statutory policies (such as compulsory third-party motor vehicle, or barristers' professional indemnity, with the wording approved by the Government) or industry standard terms (such as Institute Yacht Clauses); 

(3)different underwriters take different attitudes to the risks they are prepared to cover; 

(4)liability policies for pleasure craft, (meaning recreational use of watercraft) were available and known to be different to ""commercial"" or ""business"" liability cover; 

(5)the cover arranged by Horsell for PADI members over a number of years was not limited to insureds who owned or used watercraft in relation to their business. That is, the policy was available to members of PADI whose business activities involved scuba diving, as defined in the policy, whether or not the instructor involved use of watercraft. Not only did the extended definition of scuba diving as defined in clause 2.11 of the policy include many activities for which watercraft are not required but the policy was also available to instructors, dive shop owners and dive masters; and 

(6)insurers have a legitimate commercial interest in distinguishing between business and private/recreational risks. As this incident demonstrates, recreational use may more readily involve distractions and inadvertence whereas business use is more likely to be subject to regulation and to be taken more seriously by an operator conscious of business reputation. 

50Mr Sexton submitted that the insuring clause and clause 2.11 operate together in two ways: first, to identify the nature of the business insured, so that, for example, if the insured's business enterprises also included some business unrelated to the business identified, then that unrelated business is not covered; and, secondly, to require that the occurrence giving rise to the claim is sufficiently connected with that identified business. Accordingly, for example, it is not sufficient that there be merely the activity of ""transportations of people from one island to another"" or ""bird watching"" or ""fishing"" or ""beach games"". Two further requirements must be satisfied. The first is that the activity must be related to ""recreational scuba diving"". The second is that the activity must have a sufficient ""connection with the Insured's Business"". 

51Mr Sexton said that it was a legitimate and understandable line that the insurer was entitled to draw in a policy between insuring business activities as distinct from private activities and that that was what had occurred in the instant case: the insurer had contracted to insure a risk that was ""in connection with the Insured's Business"" and it did not cover risks that did not have such a connection. 

52Mr Sexton relied on the statements by the Full Federal Court in Health Insurance Commission v Freeman (1998) 158 ALR 267 at 273, per Merkel J: 

""The words 'in connection with' have been accepted as capable of describing a spectrum of relationships between things, one of which is bound up with or involved in another: see Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 456; (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 288. However, as was pointed out by Sackville J in Taciak v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1995) 59 FCR 285 at 295, the question that remains in a particular case is what kind of relationship will suffice to establish the connection contemplated by the statute. That requires a 'value judgment about the range of the statute': see Pozzolanic (at 289)"" 

[Emphasis added] 

53Although the statement set out above was made in the context of statutes, the principle has been held to be applicable to interpretation of commercial contracts: Thomas v State of New South Wales [2008] NSWCA 316 at [19] - [21], per Campbell JA, and Fraser v The Irish Restaurant & Bar Company P/L [2008] QCA 270 at [43], per Muir JA. 

54Mr Sexton submitted that, if Mr Todd was playing beach cricket on a Sunday with his children and negligently hit one of them with the bat, this policy would not respond, notwithstanding that Mr Todd was engaged in a ""beach game"". The result would not be different if the bat was an asset of the business. Similarly, if, for example, Mr Todd travelled to some remote location and negligently blinded a friend with a hook whilst fishing, this policy would not respond, notwithstanding that the word ""fishing"" appears in clause 2.11. 

55Mr Sexton submitted that if I did not accept Mr Todd's evidence as to the purpose of the trip, then the insuring clause is simply not engaged, notwithstanding the use of an asset owned by the insured and generally used in connection with the insured's business. In that case the claim by Mr Lane simply had no connection to the business. 

56Mr Sexton made detailed written submissions as to why I ought not accept Mr Todd's evidence. These submissions largely followed the foundation laid in his cross-examination of Mr Todd. He also submitted that I could draw a Jones v Dunkel ((1959) 101 CLR 298) inference that neither the evidence of Mrs Todd, nor any of the two couples who were also present on the boat could have assisted the defendants case because none of these people was called and no reason was established for their non-attendance. He submitted that the onus of establishing unavailability lies on the party against whom Jones v Dunkel operates ( Cross on Evidence , 2012, online version, [1215] and fn 23). 

57In the alternative, Mr Sexton submitted that even if I accepted Mr Todd's evidence, it involved, at its highest, a subjective, uncommunicated hope or expectation that a trip on the boat, for a picnic, without any scuba diving or swimming, might generate some business. He submitted that in that event the ""connection"" with the business is so ephemeral that, notwithstanding the many statements in the cases concerning the width of the expression ""in connection with"", the factual circumstance simply does not meet the discernible commercial purpose of the insuring clause, namely, to provide cover for the activities identified in the definition of ""Scuba Diving"" which also have a real or proximate or not insignificant connection with the insured's business in so far as it involves ""recreational scuba diving"". 

58He submitted that sightseeing on the Myall River does not fall within the insuring clause because it is unconnected in any relevant sense with recreational scuba diving. 

59Mr Sexton relied on Intrend Pty Ltd & Ors v O'Halloran & Ors [2006] SADC 95, a case in which Mr O'Halloran took his friend Ms Byrant into his office in the early morning and left a cigarette which started a fire and caused damage to the premises. One issue was whether an exclusion clause which operated to exclude claims ""arising out of"" or ""in connection with"" any business profession or occupation of the insured applied. 

60The Court at first instance held that the fact that Mr O'Halloran was an employee of the business, had access to the premises and caused the fire on the premises did not constitute a sufficient connection to any business profession or occupation with the result that the exclusion clause was not engaged. The Court also considered whether Mr O'Halloran was entitled to indemnity under a QBE policy which had been issued to Mr O'Halloran's employer, but would respond if the damage was ""caused by an occurrence in connection with such persons' business"" (see [152] - [162]). While the fire occurred on the premises of the business, the Court concluded, at [160] - [161]: 

""...Mr O'Halloran was not acting in any way connected with Bocksoffice's business when he disposed of unextinguished cigarette remains after having smoked cigarettes with Ms Bryant whilst visiting the Bocksoffice premises for purposes which I find to be completely unrelated to its business and to his employment at its business. I consider that, when he entered and remained in Bocksoffice's premises that night and when he did what he did, Mr O'Halloran was on a frolic of his own . 

I conclude that none of what Mr O'Halloran did in the Bocksoffice premises that night (which could be events resulting in property damage) occurred whilst he was acting within the scope of his duties as an employee of Bocksoffice. I also conclude that none of what Mr O'Halloran did in the Bocksoffice premises that night were occurrences in connection with the business of an advertising agency conducted at those premises by Bocksoffice."" 

61On appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia ( RAA-GIO Insurance Ltd v O'Halloran & Ors; Australian Kitchen Industries P/L v O'Halloran [2007] SASC 245), Duggan J, with whom Nyland and Kelly JJ agreed, referred to the following passage from Hadfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487 at 491: 

""Expressions such as ""relating to"", ""in relation to"", ""in connection with"" and ""in respect of"" are commonly found in legislation but invariably raise problems of statutory interpretation. They are terms which fluctuate in operation from statute to statute... The terms may have a very wide operation but they do not usually carry the widest possible ambit, for they are subject to the context in which they are used, to the words with which they are associated and to the object or purpose of the statutory provision in which they appear ."" 

[Emphasis added.] 
62Duggan J applied Hadfield , and said, at [30]: 

""Mr O'Halloran was not engaged in the performance of any duty associated with his occupation at the time of the negligent act which caused the fire. The fact that he was in the building where his office was located for a purpose completely unrelated to his occupation cannot provide the necessary link between the claim and that occupation. In the circumstances of the case, the claims cannot be said to arise out of or in connection with Mr O'Halloran's occupation. It follows that exclusion (d) does not apply."" 

63On the application for special leave to appeal ( RAA-GIO Insurance Limited t/as RAA Insurance v O'Halloran & Ors [2007] HCATrans 688), the appellant again submitted that the ""the liability occasioned by the negligent act of Mr O'Halloran had something to do with the employment because the negligent act occurred at the place of employment, access being obtained as a result of the employment."" The application for special leave was dismissed. 

64In reply, Mr Birch submitted that I should accept Mr Todd's evidence and that no weight ought be given to Mr Todd's classification of the trip as ""private"" since a promotional activity could accurately be described as being private notwithstanding that it is undertaken in connection with the business. 

65He submitted that Jones v Dunkel had no real effect where the person not called was the witness's spouse, since spouses are notoriously partial and would be unlikely to be regarded as corroborative, even if called. He said that no inference would arise in relation to the other couples on the boat, who were, on the defendants' case, unaware that there was a business purpose to their trip in any event. 

Construction of the insuring clause 

66In my view, Mr Sexton's analysis of the clause is correct: in other words, there are two requirements: the activity must be in some way related to recreational scuba diving and it must be ""in connection with the Insured's Business"". Although the term ""Insured's Business"" is a defined term, the words are not irrelevant to the construction. Lewison and Hughes summarise the principle in the following passage, at 198: 

""Where the construction of a defined term is at issue, the label itself will itself be a highly relevant contextual factor. So, in Chartbrook Limited v Persimmon Homes Limited [2009] 1 AC 1101 at [17], the parties agreed on a definition of 'Minimum Guaranteed Residential Unit Value', which was defined according to a formula. Lord Hoffman held that the label assigned to the formula was relevant to the interpretation of the formula. He said: 

'[T]he contract does not use algebraic symbols. It uses labels. The words used as labels are seldom arbitrary. They are usually chosen as a distillation of the meaning or purpose of a concept intended to be more precisely stated in the definition. In such cases the language of the defined expression may help to elucidate ambiguities in the definition or other parties of the agreement.' 

Lord Walker agreed that it was legitimate to 'give weight to the natural meaning of words in a definition' (at [94])."" 

67Once it is accepted, as in my view it must be, that the words ""Insured's Business"" are relevant to the construction of the insuring clause, I consider that a construction which disregards the requirement that there be a connection with the business, albeit as defined, is at odds with the policy. It follows that I do not think that a trip along the Myall River, which is conducted for private purposes which are unconnected with the business, falls within the insuring clause. 

68In my view, the words ""in connection with the Insured's Business"" are apt to include the promotion of the business, whether by way of thanking persons for referring business or by entertaining people with a view to obtaining further business. It is well established that the words ""in connection with"" ought be read as extending the scope of the noun they precede and ought not be read narrowly. The words merely require a relationship between one thing and another: Selected Seeds Pty Ltd v QBEMM Pty Ltd [2009] QCA 286 at [22]; Drayton v Martin (1996) 67 FCR 1 at 32, per Sackville J; Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Pty Ltd (1987) 16 FCR 465 at 479, per Wilcox J. Although the connection must be real and not merely tenuous, I consider that this threshold would be met in this case if I were satisfied that the purpose of the trip was the promotion of Dive Two's scuba diving business. 

69Fairly obviously, if the purpose of the trip had been to promote the business, it could be expected that the guests would not have to pay. I do not think that the fact that the guests did not have to pay for the trip would have made it any less a trip in connection with the insured's business, if I had otherwise been satisfied that the purpose of the trip was to promote the business. 

70I reject Mr Martin's submission that the endorsement in paragraph 2 of the Quotation can assist in resolving an ambiguity in the policy. I consider that the somewhat sparse wording of the endorsement is wholly inadequate to support the contention that it was designed to provided public liability cover for boats up to 12 metres without any of the qualifications in insuring clause 1. Although Mr Martin contended that this was implicit in the Quotation and the limited exclusion, it seems to me that he is requiring the words of the quotation to do more work than they were designed for. 

71I do not accept that the purpose of the endorsement was to extend the ambit of the insuring clause to cover claims arising from the use, operation and maintenance of such vessels. Had it been intended to have such a meaning, then express words would have been required. In my view, the words ""use, operation and maintenance"" would have had to appear in the endorsement itself. 

72I consider that the Quotation was of historical importance only. In my view, the purpose of the endorsement was to make it clear that boats less than 12 metres in length would not be covered by the exclusion clause which applied to boats of greater length. 
Whether the evidence of Mr Todd (that he was promoting his business) establishes that he is covered by the policy 

73There is a substantial issue about the purpose of the afternoon's boat trip which is relevant to whether the insuring clause applies. For the reasons given above, I consider that if this purpose could be established, the claim would be covered since it would be ""in connection with the Insured's Business"". 

74None of the six people on the boat trip that ended in the collision went scuba diving or swimming that afternoon. There is no evidence about the appearance of Dive One and whether it displayed any insignia or other identification of the business of Dive Two. In establishing the purpose of the afternoon's boat trip, the defendants depend, at least in support of their primary case, on Mr Todd's evidence and my assessment of his credibility. 

75Mr Todd deposed in his statement, which he verified on oath before me, that he had been hoping to attract some business from the local high school and, to that end, he had invited two people whom he believed to work there, together with their spouses, on a trip on Dive Two's boat. He gave oral evidence that he did not make his intentions known to his guests, but that he had discussed the proposal with his wife before the trip. Concerned that Dive Two's business was limited to tourists and that his competitor was attracting more local business, he wanted to expand to include more of the local market. Another purpose of the trip was to thank his guests for the business that they had already referred to Dive Two. 

76For the reasons that follow, I do not accept Mr Todd's evidence on this matter. In the course of his cross-examination of Mr Todd, Mr Sexton exposed the changes in the versions Mr Todd had given as to the purpose of the trip, as a result of which I was persuaded that the version given by Mr Todd in a statement for the purpose of these proceedings, was designed to further his interests and cannot be relied upon. 

77The first version given by Mr Todd about the purpose of the trip was the one he gave to police shortly after the collision. He was interviewed by police on the day of the collision and then interviewed two days later, on 31 July 2006. Liberty tendered his record of interview and relied on it as a prior inconsistent statement. He was asked by police about the purpose of the trip. He gave the following answers: 

""This was a private function, it was my wife onboard and four of her friends... 

My wife wanted to take a couple of her work friends and, yeah, husbands up to the other side of Tea Gardens to have some drinks and lunch."" 

78The second version was the one he gave in an attachment to his incident report. He said that his wife typed out some notes he had made shortly after the incident. It appears that at this time Mr Todd probably believed that he was covered by insurance whether the trip was in connection with his business or not because the length of his boat was less than 12 metres. In this version he described the trips he had taken earlier that day (which are referred to in more detail below) and then wrote: 

""STARTED FAMILY RUN AT 1.45."" 

79The third version is reflected in the Facts Sheet tendered by the police at the sentence hearing before the Local Court at Raymond Terrace. The Facts Sheet is dated 10 August 2006. The version tendered appears to have been printed on 14 October 2006. Mr Todd entered a plea on 6 November 2006 to the charge of navigating at a speed dangerous occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to Crimes Act 1900 s 52B(3)(b). The sentence hearing at which the Facts Sheet was tendered took place on 24 September 2007. Mr Todd accepted that he read it carefully prior to the hearing on 6 November 2006. 
80Relevantly the Facts Sheet records as follows: 

""There were six persons on board this vessel that was being used in a recreational capacity. The accused had spent the afternoon having a picnic lunch with friends at Tea Gardens."" 

81When it was put to Mr Todd in cross-examination that these were accurate statements, he answered: 

""It- it was a recreational as in non-fare paying capacity and that would be as far as it goes. Recreational diving. Diving is a recreational sport."" 

82His answer was non-responsive and demonstrated that he could not think of a way around the question. Whether or not diving is recreational for those participating in it is beside the point since for him it was a business. But this is beside the point, too, because the trip in which he was engaged did not involve diving at all and no scuba gear was on the boat. Although Mr Todd did not seem, in his oral evidence, to be highly attuned to the nuances of language, he showed himself as being capable of answering questions posed by police on 31 July 2006. Furthermore he was represented at the hearing before the Magistrate and would presumably have been afforded an opportunity to correct any error in the Facts Sheet. 

83Liberty tendered correspondence with Horsell in the period between January and February 2007 to the following effect: 

(1)an email from Horsell to Liberty dated 29 January 2007 in which Horsell seeks written confirmation that the insurer was of opinion that the insured was not covered; 

(2)an email in response from Liberty to Horsell dated 1 February 2007 which refers to ""Our recent telephone discussion in which you confirmed that the voyage being undertaken by Mr Todd was a private one and not relate to his business refers""; 

(3)a letter from Slater & Gordon (the defendants' solicitors) to Horsell dated 15 February 2007 in which they note the denial of indemnity and give notice that proceedings will be issued; and 

(4)an email from Horsell to Liberty dated 19 February 2007 which attaches the letter referred to above and which contains the following passage: "". . . we were all of like mind when last we spoke to send investigators to interview the other passengers on the boat to confirm the reason for the trip. You will recall Bill is saying he was providing passengers with a free trip in remuneration for assistance they had given him by promotion of [Dive Two]"". 

84I infer, notwithstanding Mr Todd's denials in cross-examination, that by 19 February 2007, he was aware that the insurer would deny indemnity unless he could establish that there was a business component to his trip. I also infer that, notwithstanding his denial in evidence before me that he had had a conversation with Horsell, he had spoken to Horsell, appreciated the case he needed to make to get insurance cover and come up with the story that he was providing passengers with a free trip to thank them for past referrals. This constitutes a fourth version. 

85Had this version been true, then it could be expected that Mr Todd would be able to corroborate this in some way, either by providing details of the past referrals or by calling the passengers who are alleged to have provided the referrals. 

86There was then a fifth version given in a letter dated 26 May 2010 in which the defendants' solicitors provided particulars in response to a request from Liberty's solicitors dated 23 February 2010. The defendants were asked to identify the specific purpose for which the vessel was being used at the time of the accident. They responded: 

""The business was being used for sightseeing and business marketing activities."" 

87The defendants were asked, in the request for particulars, to identify the passengers on board the vessel. They identified two couples, as well as Mr and Mrs Todd. In answer to the request, the defendants answered: 

""Both the couples had referred customers to 'the business' and the trip was organised to thank them and to [seek] continual referrals... 

The invitation was relayed to [the two other couples aboard Dive One at the time of the accident] through Mrs Todd that Mr Todd would like to thank them for referring business to his dive business by inviting them on a sightseeing tour up the Myall River..."" 

88The final version omitted all references to thanking the passengers for past referrals and was confined to promotion of the business. It is contained in the document entitled ""First Amended Statement of Cross-Claim"" filed on 25 February 2011. Paragraph 36 of that document reads: 

""The trip related to the business activities of Dive One. 

PARTICULARS 

The trip was for the purposes of promoting the Dive One business to associates of Mr Todd who worked at the local high school, being a market to which Mr Todd wanted to have access."" 

89Unsurprisingly, the version given by Mr Todd in his statement dated 17 May 2011 corresponds with the final version referred to above. He deposed in his statement that the purpose of the trip was ""to generate business"". He said that he had ""a keen desire to break into the local high school market"". There was nothing in his affidavit, as he admitted in cross-examination, about thanking the passengers for earlier referrals. Mr Sexton probed him about what referrals he had obtained from the passengers. Initially he said that one of the couples had referred a group of snorkelers to his business, but later he admitted that this had not occurred. He was unable to identify any business which had been referred by the other couples. 

90At the conclusion of a detailed and careful cross-examination of Mr Todd conducted by Mr Sexton I was left with the impression that the first version that Mr Todd had given to police was correct: namely, that the trip was a recreational one which was not made in connection with his business. It was only when Mr Todd realised that indemnity was being declined because the trip was not connected with his business that he constructed a version that the trip was undertaken to thank the passengers for past referrals. However, when he became aware that the insurer's investigation was such that the other passengers were being questioned and did not support this version, he concocted another version, namely that he was also endeavouring to promote the business with a view to obtaining business from the local high school. Ultimately, he entirely dropped the suggestion that he was thanking passengers for past referrals and confined his evidence as to the purpose of the trip to promoting the business. 

91I do not accept Mr Todd's evidence as to the trip, or the surrounding circumstances unless it is corroborated or it amounts to a statement against interest. 

92I should add that, as to other matters, including what he did after the collision and the insurance that he took out, I accept Mr Todd's evidence since it is, in my view, unaffected by the motive that affected his credibility in relation to the purpose of the trip. 

Whether incontrovertible facts establish that the insuring clause applies 

93As referred to above, Mr Birch put a case in the alternative to the one he put which relied on Mr Todd's evidence as to the purpose of the trip: namely that I should find that the activity was in connection with the insured's business because it was conducted with an asset of the business; that it was an activity that occurred in the vicinity of the locations where Dive Two conducted its scuba diving business; and the boat was navigated by the same person as when it was engaged in the business activities of Dive Two. 

94I accept Mr Sexton's submissions that this is insufficient to establish a connection. Although the dichotomy between ""private"" and ""business"" activities is not expressed in the policy, it arises, in my view, by implication from the use of the word ""Business"" in the insuring clause. The fact that an asset of the business is used by a director of the business who is also a dive master, does not, in my view, suffice. Indeed, if it did, it would mean that small proprietary companies with a sole director, could expand the extent of cover since it will commonly be the case that the assets of the business will also be employed for private use. 

95Although the question of connection is one of fact and degree, I do not consider that Mr Todd's use of Dive One in a location proximate to Dive Two's usual business operations is sufficient to establish a connection for the purposes of the insuring clause. 

Whether the unchallenged evidence establishes that the defendant was covered under the contract 

96As set out above, Mr Birch put his case in a third way. The third basis involves my accepting Mr Todd's evidence that he was engaged in a sightseeing tour of the Myall River with his guests, that he discussed his business with them and that this discussion would tend to have the effect of promoting the business. Accordingly, so the argument ran, I ought conclude that the claim arose in connection with the insured's business. 

97Although this submission was put notwithstanding Mr Sexton's objection, I propose to deal with it before considering whether it falls within the defendants' pleaded case. 

98The first question that arises is whether I am entitled not to accept Mr Todd's evidence on a particular matter when it has not been the subject of express challenge in cross-examination. For the reasons given above, I am not inclined to accept Mr Todd unless corroborated or where he has made a statement against interest on matters concerning the subject trip. 

99Nonetheless even if I accepted that Mr Todd mentioned his business to the couples on the boat in the course of the afternoon's trip (a matter which would be unsurprising), I do not consider that this amounts to a ""connection"" with the business. It is a matter of common experience that people in a social situation talk about their work. I do not consider that this is sufficient to convert such social situations to events which are ""in connection with the business"". 

100Nor do I consider it to be sufficient that the trip involved ""sightseeing"". Having regard to its location and particular attractions, it would be difficult to travel along the Myall River at any time and in any circumstances without engaging in sightseeing in some way. That Mr Todd, as the skipper of Dive One, takes people along the Myall River in connection with its business does not mean that when he takes his wife and her friends along the same river in Dive One for reasons otherwise unconnected with the business, it is converted into a trip to which the insuring clause responds merely because the activity of sightseeing is almost inevitably involved. 

101Accordingly, I find that the policy does not respond to the claim. 

Pleadings relevant to the construction of the insuring clause 

102At the conclusion of Mr Birch's submissions in chief, Mr Sexton submitted that it was not open to Mr Birch to make a case that involves one or other or a combination of: 

(1)the use of assets of the business (the boat and/or the skipper); 

(2)an activity of a sort in which the business usually engaged, namely sightseeing on the Myall River (or the mere fact alone of transporting people from one island (Australia) to another island (Witts Island); and 

(3)not a purpose per se but a result allegedly connected with the business - that is, that the mere fact that there was a trip using an asset of the business and/or during which there was discussion about the business might have the result that good will was produced. 

103He submitted that such a case was outside the pleadings and that the second cross defendant had conducted its case on the basis of the pleading. He said that he had not cross-examined Mr Todd about whether sightseeing on the Myall River was ""usual"" business and that Liberty had not investigated, by discovery or otherwise, whether the activity engaged in was likely to produce good will. He also pointed out that this ""new"" case that the promotion of the business was a likely result of the trip made the absence from the witness box of the other two couples present on the boat relevant. Mr Sexton submitted that this introduced a different concept to the subjective hope or expectation of Mr Todd (which was particularised) and which depended on my assessment of Mr Todd. 

104Mr Sexton, notwithstanding his objection to the submission, dealt with its substance after making the submissions set out below on the construction of the insuring clause. 

105Mr Birch maintained that his submissions fell within the pleadings as they stood and that no amendment was required. He also said that if Mr Sexton had misapprehended the way the defendants put their cross-claim, he would be disposed to consider any application Mr Sexton might make to have Mr Todd recalled for further cross-examination. Mr Sexton confirmed that he was making no such application in light of Mr Birch's adherence to his pleading. It follows that it falls to me to determine whether Mr Birch's submissions fall within the cross-claim as pleaded. 

106The question whether the defendants' submissions ought be constrained by the pleading does not arise since I have found against the defendants on the application of the insuring clause. However for completeness, my reasons for decision on the pleading point are set out below. 

107There were essentially three bases on which Mr Birch argued that the claim was covered by the insuring clause, set out in more detail above. I will deal with them as follows: 

(1)The claim was covered because of Mr Todd's evidence that a purpose of the trip was to promote the business even though that purpose was not communicated to his guests; 

(2)The claim was covered because a vessel of the business was being used in a location not far from the usual operations of the business and it was skippered by one of the business's usual dive boat operators; and 

(3)The claim was covered because of the matters referred to in (2) above and also because it was involved in an activity or the sort with which the business was commonly engaged, namely sightseeing on the Myall River and it was an activity which was objectively likely to produce good will for the business among potential customers. 

108In my view the pleading point does not arise in the determination of the first or second ways in which Mr Birch puts his case. The first way is expressly pleaded and particularised. The second depends on facts that ought be regarded as incontrovertible. It does, however, arise in the determination of the third way since the evidence relied upon was not specifically challenged, although a general challenge was made to Mr Todd's credibility. 

109The First Amended Cross-Claim relevantly pleads: 

""36. The trip related to the business activities of Dive One. 

PARTICULARS 

The trip was for the purposes of promoting the Dive One business to associates of Mr Todd who worked at the local high school, being a market to which Mr Todd wanted to have access. 

... 

47. On 29 July 2006, when the Insurance Policy (or alternative Insurance Policy as set out above) was in force, a collision involving the vessel occurred which gave rise to circumstances covered by the Insurance Policy, namely: 

a. Rian Lane suffered injury giving rise to a claim by him against Dive Two and Mr Todd, being a claim to which the Insurance Policy applies. 

b. Dive Two and Mr Todd were sued by Mr Page, giving rise to a claim to which the Insurance Policy applies. 

c. Mr Todd was subject to a criminal prosecution and incurred costs defending same, giving rise to a claim to which the Insurance Policy applies."" 

110Mr Birch submitted that paragraph 36 of the pleadings was not a necessary part of the pleading. It pleaded material facts but did not purport to be, and did not, set out each and every one of the bases on which the defendants said that they were covered by the policy. He said that all submissions on the proper construction of the insuring clause, and the way in which the claim fell within it were open, having regard to the terms of paragraph 47. 

111Mr Sexton submitted that the defendants ought to be confined to paragraph 36 in so far as they alleged that the claim arose in connection with the business of Dive Two. Accordingly, he submitted that the defendants could only succeed in obtaining cover if I accepted Mr Todd's evidence that the boat trip was for the purposes of promoting the business and I found that this fell within the insuring clause in the policy. 

112The defendants also sought to establish that the claim for indemnity falls within insuring clause 1 on the basis of other factors. As referred to above, Mr Sexton contends that Mr Birch cannot put such submissions. I consider that it is open to Mr Birch to put matters in submission that arise from facts which are relevantly uncontroverted. 

113I consider that the way in which the matter was pleaded has the effect that where evidence other than that which fell within the particulars to paragraph 36, or which was incontrovertible is relied on in support of the proposition that the trip was ""in connection with the Insured's Business"", the defendants ought be constrained. Although there is some force in Mr Birch's submission that the pleading in paragraph 36 that ""the trip related to the business activities of Dive One"" does not paraphrase the insuring clause, I consider that a reader of paragraph 36 would consider the particulars constituted the basis on which the pleader wanted to put the connection. 

114Had I considered that the pleading point would make a difference to the outcome of the case, I would have taken steps to ensure that the parties were given an opportunity to adequately address it. It is wholly undesirable that cases be decided on the basis of such points. It would have been inconsistent with the interests of justice for the defendants' case against Liberty to be dismissed because of a pleading point, and the defendants' case against Horsell to be dismissed because the insuring clause in fact responded. 

Was the activity engaged in by Mr Todd excluded under the insurance policy? 

115This question must be determined since, if the exclusion clause applies, the defendants cannot succeed against Horsell. 

Construction of the exclusion clause 

The defendants' submissions on the construction of the exclusion clause 

116Mr Birch submitted that clause 7.24 must be read in light of the contract as a whole and with regard to its commercial purpose and effect ( Darlington Futures Limited v Delco Australia Pty Limited (1986) 161 CLR 500 and McCann v Switzerland Insurance (2000) 203 CLR 579). He argued that the purpose of the policy was to provide public liability insurance to a dive operator who, in the contemplation of the parties to the policy, would use a dive boat for the conduct of much of the business. Further, the very nature of the cover must have been intended to respond to circumstances where there had been conduct by the insured that could give rise to liability. Such conduct, he argued, would commonly be negligent conduct by the insured or one of its officers or employees. 

117He submitted that negligent conduct, as in the instant case, often amounts to criminal conduct. The fact that the legislature has chosen to criminalise the conduct does not determine the question whether it falls within an exclusion clause in terms of exclusion clause 7.24. 

118Mr Birch submitted that the word ""criminal"" ought be construed in the context of the whole phrase in which it appears: ""any alleged or actual fraudulent, dishonest, malicious, wilful or criminal act or omission of the insured..."" It ought take its flavour from the preceding words, each of which has an element of intent. He submitted that where the element of intention was lacking from the criminal act, for example because it was the product of inadvertence or negligence rather than intention, it was not intended to be covered by the policy. 

119Mr Birch also relied on Section C of the Policy, which provides for legal expenses to be paid in certain circumstances, including ""pleas of mitigation for a criminal defence against the insured"". There is a special exclusion clause, clause 3.9, in Section C, which excludes ""dishonest, fraudulent, malicious or deliberate acts or omissions"". He submitted that it would be anomalous if the insured could be covered for legal expenses in relation to a plea in mitigation for dangerous navigation but not entitled to indemnity in respect of a claim for damages for negligence brought by the person injured as a result of the dangerous navigation. 

120Guidance was to be obtained, in Mr Birch's submission, by the approach of the Court of Appeal in Australian Aviation Underwriting Pty Limited v Henry (1988) 12 NSWLR 121 ( Henry ), which demonstrated a preparedness of Courts to read down plain words where their plain meaning was discordant with the context in which they appeared, or the purpose of the insurance contract itself. 

121In Henry , the relevant insurance policy contained an exclusion for claims arising from ""an Insured Person's own criminal act"". The words appeared in the following clause, at 122: 

""This Policy does not cover death or disablement - 

... 

3. resulting from suicide or attempted suicide or intentional self-injury, or from deliberate exposure to exceptional danger (except in an attempt to save human life), or from an Insured Person's own criminal act , or sustained whilst the Insured is in a state of insanity;"" 

[Emphasis added.] 

122The Court construed the word ""criminal"" as excluding acts of negligence, notwithstanding that they were also criminal. Part of the basis of the Court's reasoning was that the parties to the agreement must have contemplated that a substantial reason for the existence of the cover was an accident arising from the insured's negligence and it could not have been intended to exclude that liability by reference to criminal acts. In Henry , the trial judge found that ""there was an inadvertent failure by the deceased to keep a proper lookout and to keep his motor vehicle on his correct side of the road so as not to drive it into the path of oncoming traffic"" (at 123). Accordingly the exclusion clause did not apply once ""criminal act"" was read down. 

123Mr Birch relied on the reasoning of the majority in Henry , as expressed in the following passage at 124 - 125, per Hope JA: 

""It is trite that in construing insurance policies as in construing any other contract, words should generally be given their ordinary meaning. There are however many well-known exceptions to this rule, and one overriding qualification is that it is necessary to have regard to the context in which the words appear. The first relevant context in the present case is that the policy is, as it is intituled, a 'Personal Accident Policy' and that the bodily injury insured is injury which is caused by an accident. It is obvious that one of the very common ways in which an insured under such a policy would be likely to be injured by an accident would be by his involvement in a motor vehicle accident. These accidents can no doubt occur without the driver of either vehicle (if two vehicles are involved) committing any criminal offence, but as Bailhache J pointed out in Tinline ([1921] 3 KB 327), probably in the great majority of cases motor car accidents are due to the breach by the driver (I would add, or one of the drivers) of some enactment. In these circumstances, looking not merely at the language of exclusion 3 but looking at the context of the whole policy, some limitation should be read into the ordinary meaning of the words ""from an insured person's own criminal act"". Indeed the question which arises for decision is rather what limitation should be read in rather than whether any limitation should be read into these words."" 

124Mr Birch said that although Mr Todd was guilty of a criminal act, it was, in substance, a negligent act and if all negligent acts which were also criminal were excluded from cover, then the insured would be substantially deprived of any benefit from a policy, the main purpose of which was to insure against liabilities occasioned by negligent acts. Therefore, he submitted, the word ""criminal"" in the exclusion clause, should be read ""intentionally criminal"". 

125He also drew my attention to the following passage from the judgment of Priestley JA, at 127 - 128: 

""One factor which helps me reach this view is that problems of interpretation of the present kind have frequently arisen in the past, as the cases referred to by Hope JA show. Further, it seems to me likely that the insurer has been aware at least in a general and derivative way, of the various judicial decisions on policy clauses with a family resemblance to its own. On that basis it seems to me that the insurer having chosen not to express the policy in words that make the matter clear, has left the exclusion in a form which it knows may be read in the way in which it was in fact read by the trial judge in this case. The insurer having conducted its business on the basis of a policy so worded, it does not seem to me to be unfair that the policy should be understood as meaning, adversely to the insurer's arguments in this litigation, what the insurer knew it might well be thought to mean."" 

126Mr Birch said that Mr Todd's acts and omissions were negligent. Although he was driving the boat too fast in the circumstances, he was not travelling at an excessive speed per se . He was not intoxicated at the time of the accident. Although Mr Todd might invite criticism for not cleaning sea salt that had accumulated on the vessel's windscreen (discussed in more detail below), salt on the windscreen is the inevitable result of travel in this area. It was the combination of the sun at a particular angle and the salt-encrusted windscreen which affected Mr Todd's visibility. Mr Birch submitted that it would be wrong to characterise his conduct as ""criminal"", as this word is used in the policy when it ought be more accurately seen as negligent, notwithstanding that it amounted to a criminal offence. 

127Mr Birch also drew my attention to the more recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Xerri v Kingmill Pty Limited (t/as Thrifty Car Rentals) (1998) 25 MVR 569 ( Xerri ) in which the Court of Appeal found that the claimant could not recover because the claim was excluded. In Xerri , the driver of the vehicle had commenced to do an illegal U-turn immediately prior to the collision which caused his death and which was the subject of the claim. 

128In Xerri , the relevant exclusion clause was, in substance, that liability was excluded where there was a breach of clause 4(f), which provided: 

""Vehicle must not be used or driven in contravention of the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act of the State of New South Wales..."" 

129Mr Birch submitted that the policy wording in Xerri was distinguishable from the instant case, which was closer to that in Henry . 
Liberty's submissions on the construction of the exclusion clause 

130Mr Sexton submitted, that even assuming the act of Mr Todd was a criminal act, the exclusion will only be engaged if he is a ""person covered by clause 3"". If Mr Todd is found to have been acting within the scope of his duties, then the policy will cover him, but he will be excluded from cover if his conduct falls within exclusion clause 7.24. 

131Mr Sexton submitted that Henry turned on its own facts and the terms of the policy, and that Xerri was a better guide to interpretation of the policy in the instant case. 

132Mr Sexton relied on what the Court of Appeal in Xerri said of Henry : 

""The court was referred to passages in Australian Aviation Underwriting Ltd v Henry (1988) 12 NSWLR 121 at 124, 126, 127. While these passages indicate the ubiquity of the principles of public policy, they provide no support for the proposition that the court can avoid the terms of the policy by finding that an unintentional crime was involved. Henry recognises that an exclusion clause inserted by an insurer will be read contra proferentem , and applies that principle by reading down an exclusion relating to death resulting from 'an insured person's own criminal act' so as not to apply where that criminal act was negligent or inadvertent. See also Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd v Wright (1997) 10 ANZ Ins Cas 61-390. But Henry does not go any further. While the mere fact that a person commits a crime does not preclude reliance upon insurance cover, at least where the crime is unintentional ( Gardner v Moore [1984] AC 548), it would be entirely fallacious to invert this into the proposition that commission of an unintentional crime brings an insured within the cover of a policy that clearly excludes conduct of the relevant type."" 

133Mr Sexton said that, in any event, it would be wrong to regard the Crimes Act 1900 s 52B(3)(b) as an offence of negligence since the section did not use the word ""negligently"". He noted that it was relevantly identical to s 52A, the offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm and referred to the following passage from Jiminez v R (1992) 173 CLR 572, in which the majority said, at 579: 

""For the driving to be dangerous for the purposes of s.52A there must be some feature which is identified not as a want of care but which subjects the public to some risk over and above that ordinarily associated with the driving of a motor vehicle, including driving by persons who may, on occasions, drive with less than due care and attention."" 

134He also referred me to R v Phirum Uch De Montero [2009] VSCA 255, in which the Victorian Court of Appeal, after undertaking a comprehensive review of the authorities, placed dangerous driving between negligent and culpable driving on a spectrum of wrongdoing. He submitted that the additional factors which made the navigation dangerous rather than simply negligent were consistent with the insurer's objective intention to exclude such conduct from cover. 

135Mr Sexton also submitted that, although many acts associated with driving a boat may be both criminal acts even though they also amount to negligence, the activities covered by the policy concern many matters which might give rise to a claim for indemnity which would not amount to criminal offences. Therefore there was no need to read down the words ""criminal act or omission"", since the policy was not illusory even if the words are giving their plain meaning. 

Whether the defendants' dangerous navigation triggered the exclusion clause 

136There is some evidence about what occurred immediately prior to the collision, which sheds some light on how and why it occurred. 

137Mr Todd is recorded as having told police on 31 July 2006 that he only slowed down just before the impact; he was ""having trouble seeing"" due to accumulation of salt on Dive One's windscreen resulting from ""a fair bit of salt work"" he had done in the morning. He told them that he ""lost vision"" through the screen and then tried to look through the gap between the glass and the canopy, which was only about 2 - 3 inches wide. Mr Todd estimated the speed of the boat to be about 18 knots before he slowed down just prior to the collision to about 12 - 15 knots. He described the collision to police in the following terms: 

""...there was a massive thud and in hindsight that's where I've gone over the person, over the boat..."" 

138Parts of the police interview were put to Mr Todd in cross-examination. His evidence to me was inconsistent. Notwithstanding his prior admissions to police, he maintained at one stage in the hearing, on oath: 

""I could quite easily see out the windscreen."" 

139Mr Sexton also put the Facts Sheet to him from the Local Court criminal proceedings. The Facts Sheet recorded: 

""The accused was travelling at a stated speed of 15 to 20 knots. When the accused rounded port marker 210 he realised his vision was restricted by the setting sun. The accused has reduced the speed of his vessel to about 12 to 15 knots. The accused's vessel is fitted with a Perspex windscreen that had heavy salt build up further impeding the masters vision. The accused realised that he could not see out of the salt covered windscreen. To counter this the accused has kept a lookout through a gap in the canopy that he estimated as being about four by six inches in size."" 

140In evidence before me, Mr Todd said that the windscreen was 1.2 metres wide and 400 - 500 millimetres high. When it was put to him that he was looking through a small gap of about 4 by 6 inches between the canopy and the top of the windscreen (as recorded in the Facts Sheet), he said: 

""Yes, but I had my head, the top of my head poked through the hole and I would be able to see quite literally over the top of it."" 

141I find that Mr Todd was barely aware of the presence of the other boat until immediately prior to impact. He had little chance to slow his boat or avoid the collision. Had he cleaned the salt from the windscreen, his visibility and range of vision would have been significantly greater. Having regard to his compromised vision, he was driving at an excessive speed. 

142There is, however, no suggestion that Mr Todd intended the collision or intended the plaintiff any harm. Immediately following the collision he acted so as to safeguard the other passengers and save the plaintiff, who had been seriously injured. His conduct, although criminal and having serious consequences, was not intentional. 

Construction of the exclusion clause 

143In my view, while the policy must be read as a whole, the most useful guides are the words used in the clause itself. I consider both of the syntactical presumptions, noscitur a sociis (the meaning of a word is to be derived from its context) and ejusdem generis (general matters are constrained by reference to specific matters), assist in the construction of the words in clause 7.24. 

144Although the trial judge in Henry referred to the conduct of the deceased as mere inadvertence, he also regarded it as amounting to driving in a manner dangerous to the public. Notwithstanding its serious consequences, it was not intentional. The Court of Appeal read down the word ""criminal act"" to exclude non-intentional criminal acts because of the context in which it appeared. The process of construction is explained in the following passage from Hope JA's judgment, at 126: 

""The principle represented by the maxim [ noscitur a sociis ] is not some exceptional or strained principle of construction; it is an obviously sensible principle to be applied in understanding the meaning of words in their context. In the present case there is clearly enough a recognisable characteristic of the words used to describe circumstances (other than criminal acts) which, if they resulted in the relevant death or disablement, exclude the case from the cover provided by the policy. They are all intentional acts; they are all acts which will not be established if they are the result of negligence, however gross, or inadvertence. As I have indicated, this is a distinction which has been recognised otherwise for the purpose of insurance law, and recognised in relation to criminal acts. In those circumstances I have concluded that the limitation which is to be placed upon the expression ""an insured person's own criminal acts"" is one which excludes negligent or inadvertent acts."" 

145What each of the other words in clause 7.24 has in common is intention. Although an act may be criminal without any intent at all, criminal acts, like torts, can be classified as intentional or otherwise. The term ""criminal acts"" is broad and, in a sense, arbitrary since it depends on legislative choice and may cover acts of considerable seriousness or relatively trivial infringements without any requirement of intention. Because the words ""criminal act"" appear at the end of a list where the preceding words have in common an element of intention, I consider that they should be read down to include only those criminal acts that are intentional. 

146I consider the ejusdem generis rule to provide some guidance too, notwithstanding that the words ""other"" or ""etc"" are not used at the end of the list and notwithstanding that ""criminal acts"" constitute a separate category in the exclusion clause. However, where, as here, there is a list of a number of items, the meaning of a term, particularly a general one as I find ""criminal acts"" to be, is more readily ascertained by reference to the list as a whole (see, in the context of statutes, Pearce, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (2011), at [4.24]). 

147The effect of this construction is that it is immaterial that the degree of lack of care exhibited by Mr Todd was greater than mere negligence. The exclusion clause does not exclude cover in the instant case because the criminal act committed by Mr Todd was not intentional. This analysis is consistent with both Henry and Xerri . In the former case, the words ""criminal act"" were read down to exclude non-intentional criminal acts because of its context and because it was the insurer's wording and therefore the contra proferentem rule applied. In the latter case, the exclusion clause applied because its terms specifically covered the claim and there was no basis to read down the words of the exclusion. 

148Although it does not matter for the purposes of my consideration, I was not persuaded by Mr Birch's argument that clause 3.9 assists his construction of exclusion clause 7.24. There may be good reason why an insurer would be prepared to cover criminal defence costs, except where they arise out of ""any dishonest, fraudulent, malicious or deliberate act or omission of the Insured"" but not be prepared to indemnify an insured for claims arising from criminal acts of the insured per se . Different words are used in clause 3.9 of Section C than are used in clause 7.24. I do not think that the comparison between them provides any particular warrant for importing the requirement that the criminal acts or omissions excluded by clause 7.24 be intentional. 

149Accordingly, I find that clause 7.24 does not apply. 

Was the insurance broker liable to the defendant? 

150As I consider that the insuring clause, properly construed, does not respond to the claim and the claim is not otherwise excluded, the question of Horsell's liability arises. 

The nature of any duty owed by Horsell to the defendant 

151For reasons which will emerge, it is necessary to set out the defendants' pleading against Horsell: 

""50. At all material times PADI retained the services of Horsell to obtain insurance for PADI members. 

51 At all times Horsell had a duty to effect adequate insurance cover for PADI members. 

51.A At all material times PADI was the Cross-Claimants' agent. 

52. On or about June 2002 Dive Two and/or Mr Todd retained Horsell to advise them as to the insurance cover they should obtain in regard to the business of dive Two and the use by it of its vessel. 

53. It was an implied term of the agreement referred to in the preceding paragraph that Horsell would advise Dive Two and/or Mr Todd of the following matters: 

a. Whether the insurance cover effected by him for PADI members and offered by him to Dive Two and/or Mr Todd was adequate public liability insurance for Dive Two and the use of its vessel. 

b. Whether there was a need by Dive Two and/or Mr Todd to have any further separate public liability insurance through boat insurance. 

54. The facts and circumstances giving rise to the implication of the term described in paragraph 53 in the retainer agreement are as follows: 

a. Horsell in fact gave advice on the adequacy of the policy. 

b. Horsell had special expertise in regard to the adequacy of insurance policy terms and reasonably expected Dive Two and/or Mr Todd not to possess such expertise. 

c. Horsell ought reasonably to have understood that Dive Two and/or Mr Todd would rely upon Horsell to advise it as to the adequacy of the policy obtained. 

54.A The implication is necessary to give commercial efficacy to the agreement. 

55. Horsell represented to Dive Two and/or Mr Todd that: 

a. the Watertight Policy provided adequate public liability insurance 

b. there was no need to have separate public liability insurance through the boat insurance. 

PARTICULARS 

Facsimile dated 3 March 2003 from Horsell to Mr Todd with quotation for Dive Boat insurance. 

56. In consequence of the giving of the advice referred to in paragraph 55 above Horsell undertook a duty of care to Dive Two and/or Mr Todd to ensure that the advice given by him was accurate as to the adequacy of the insurance which he proposed. 

57. Mr Todd relied on that representation and cancelled, or did not renew, public liability insurance attached to his boat insurance. 

58. In the event that the Court should determine that the policy of insurance by Dive Two and/or Mr Todd procured by Horsell does not respond to the plaintiff's claim Horsell breached the implied term of the retainer described and/or the duty of care described above. 



PARTICULARS 

(i) Failed to advise Dive Two and/or Mr Todd that the insurance procured by him on their behalf was inadequate for their reasonable purposes. 

(ii) Failed to advise Dive Two and/or Mr Todd that they needed to have additional insurance for public liability in regard to any use of the vessel that was not within the terms of the insuring clause. 

59. If 

a. Mr Lane successfully prosecutes his claim against Dive Two and/or Mr Todd; and 

b. Liberty successfully defends the claim by Mr Todd and Dive Two against it in respect of the claims made against them by Rian Lane, then Dive Two and Mr Todd will suffer loss as a consequence of Horsell's failure to provide adequate insurance to Dive Two and Mr Todd. 

60. If Liberty successfully defends the claims by Dive Two and Mr Todd in respect of 

a. The Local Court Proceedings 

b. The Criminal Prosecution 

Then Dive Two and Mr Todd will suffer loss as a consequence of Horsell failure to provide adequate insurance to Dive Two and Mr Todd."" 

152Mr Martin's first submission was that it was not open to Mr Birch to submit that Horsell was guilty of negligent misstatement when the defendants' pleading and particulars merely alleged failure to advise. 

153Mr Birch rejected the proposition that his submissions fell outside the pleadings. He submitted that an insured whose insurer has declined indemnity is almost invariably in a difficult position in endeavouring to sheet home responsibility to the broker, because the insured cannot know in advance whether, and if so on what basis, the insurer will be found to be entitled to refuse indemnity. He contended that in so far as his case was based on positive statements, these were pleaded, but that the substantial claim rested on a failure to advise that the cover was inadequate, as alleged in the pleading. 

154I do not accept Mr Martin's objections to the defendants' pleading of the cross-claim. In so far as there is any ambiguity in the cross-claim, I consider that it could have been cured by a request for particulars. Essentially, the defendants' case against Horsell, as pleaded is that it made positive representations in the past which the defendants relied upon. When it came to the relevant year, the defendants allege that Horsell failed to advise them that the insurance cover they obtained was inadequate. 

155Furthermore where the principal allegation of breach is ""failure to advise"", the failure can be proved by positive evidence of advice which is inconsistent with what Horsell is alleged to have failure to advise. In other words, a statement, whether express or implied, that cover is adequate tends to establish a failure to advise that the insurance cover was inadequate. 

156Although Mr Martin contended that he would have run his case differently had the cross-claim against Horsell been in terms of negligent misstatement as distinct from representations relied upon followed by an alleged failure to advise, it is difficult to see how it could have been run differently. This is particularly so, in light of Horsell's detailed submissions in response to the defendants' submissions in support of the cross-claim against it. Far from demonstrating that Horsell could not deal with the case as put by the defendants, they show that Horsell had adequately apprehended the case it had to meet and had a substantive response to each of the defendants' submissions. 

157Accordingly, I do not propose to ""read down"" or otherwise refuse to consider Mr Birch's submissions on the cross-claim against Horsell since I consider them to be open on a fair reading of the cross-claim. 

The defendants' submissions on Horsell's liability 

158Mr Birch submitted that, through brochures and other communications, Horsell gave advice to the members of PADI in Australia, including the defendants, regarding the nature and extent of liability insurance that it could procure for them. He pointed to the circumstance that communications with PADI members, including brochures, bore the logo of Horsell. The evidence established that Horsell designed and paid for marketing materials including a brochure that described the insurance being provided as the ""PADI IRRA Watertight Liability Policy"" ( the Watertight Policy ). 

159He relied on an agreement between Horsell and PADI by which Horsell was authorised to negotiate and effect certain insurance policies in the name of PADI and all members who elected to be covered and noted that Horsell was paid a broker's fee by the insured of $612.26. 

160Mr Birch also relied on advice which Horsell gave to Dive Two directly as to the extent of coverage of the Watertight Policy. 

161Mr Birch relied on the following evidence to establish that Horsell had represented to PADI members generally that they would be covered in respect of third party liability for vessels up to 12 metres in length: 

(1)letters dated 23 September 2003 and 17 September 2004 which described the policy as proving third party liability coverage for all owned vessels up to 12 metres in length whilst used in conjunction with diving, snorkelling, swimming, fishing, whale-watching and sightseeing activities; and 

(2)promotional brochures issued in respect of the 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 years which identify as a benefit of the policy: ""liability of water craft up to 12 metres in length"" and which answer the frequently asked question: Does the public liability policy cover the liability of the dive boats we own and operate? as follows: ""Only if the vessel is under 12 metres in length..."" 

162Mr Birch also relied on communications between Horsell and Dive Two and in particular a facsimile dated 3 March 2003 in which Horsell wrote: 

""Please note that we have not quoted Liability for the vessel as the PADI watertight policy provides coverable for liability for vessels up to 12 metres in length for activities associated with Diving, Swimming, Sight Seeing, Whale Watching and Fishing."" 

163Mr Birch submitted that these circumstances gave rise to an implied contract of retainer with Horsell, which contained a term implied by law that the broker will exercise reasonable care and skill in respect of a contract for the provision of brokering services: Ogden & Co Pty Ltd v Reliance Fire Sprinkler Co Pty Ltd [1975] 1 Lloyd's LR 52. 

164Further he argued that Horsell ought reasonably to have expected that the advice would be relied upon by PADI members including Dive Two in determining what liability insurance they reasonably required. 

165Mr Birch submitted that the duty owed by a broker to the putative insured is threefold: first, to ascertain the client's requirements as to cover by instruction or otherwise; secondly, to use reasonable skill and care in advising the client as to completion of the proposal and in procuring the cover which the client has requested, either expressly or by necessary implication; and thirdly, if the broker is unable to obtain the cover required, to report to the client in what respect the broker has failed and seek the client's alternative instructions: Anthony John Sharp & Anor v Sphere Drake Insurance PLC & Ors [1992] 2 Lloyds LR 501 at 523. He said that if Horsell was aware of any legal doubt about the applicability of the Watertight Policy insurance to the circumstances of Dive Two, it had a duty to advise of those legal doubts: see FNCB Limited v Barnett Devanney (Harrow) Limited [1999] LRIR 459, where the Court held that a broker is to afford protection to a client such that if reasonably possible the client does not become involved in legal disputes at all. 

166Mr Birch submitted that Horsell was in the position of knowing the insured's needs, and knowing the insurance that existed and which was the subject of further negotiation at the relevant time. It had the power to ensure, either that the Watertight Policy insurance was sufficient to the needs of the insured, or that the insured's needs were met elsewhere in the market. 

167Mr Birch submitted that Horsell breached its duty of care by failing to advise Dive Two that the policy was inadequate to cover all activities undertaken in a boat less than 12 metres in length and in particular that it would not cover activities which were not ""in connection with the Insured's Business"" but that Protection & Indemnity cover as part of hull insurance would cover any potential deficiency in the Watertight Policy. 

168Mr Birch submitted that Horsell's negligence and breach of contract has caused the insured the loss of indemnity against the damages obtained by the plaintiff and that I should infer that had Horsell given advice that identified the deficiencies in the policy Mr Todd would have maintained a further liability policy attached to his hull insurance and that insurance would have protected him from the claims in the present matter. 

169Mr Birch relied on evidence that established that Mr Todd took out boat insurance to cover the transportation of Dive One from Melbourne to New South Wales. He maintained hull insurance, though Roderick Insurance Brokers, which had a Protection & Indemnity component, until he was advised by Horsell that the latter was not necessary, at which time he cancelled. Later he changed his hull insurance to the PADI Dive Boat Insurance Policy. He took out personal insurance to cover his activities as a Dive Master and, for a short period when he operated a dive shop, he took out insurance for that purpose. 

170Mr Birch submitted that Mr Todd was risk averse and that if he had been advised that the Watertight Policy did not necessarily cover Dive Two for liability arising from the use of Dive One, then he would have taken out Protection & Indemnity Cover as part of his hull insurance. 

Horsell's submissions on their liability to the defendants 

171Mr Martin submitted that there was no evidence that on or about June 2002, the defendants had retained Horsell to advise them as to the insurance cover they should obtain in regard to the business of Dive Two and that no such retainer could be implied. 

172Further, Mr Martin submitted that the only duty owed by a broker was to do ""what the broker is employed to do"" and that Horsell was not in breach of such duty. He contended that the facsimile of 3 March 2003 does not represent that the Watertight Policy provided adequate public liability insurance or that there was no need to have separate public liability insurance through boat (or hull) insurance. He submitted that the only obligation of a broker is to act on instructions and contended: 

""So they have no expertise, no reason to help the insured get an insurance that fits. Mr Duffy seems to misapprehend his role, if that's the case."" 

173Mr Martin contended further that, in any event, the defendants had failed to establish that either the statement in the facsimile of 3 March 2003 or the similarly worded tax invoice dated 3 November 2003 were incorrect, since the 2003/2004 policy is not in evidence. 

174Mr Martin accepted that Horsell was the author of the brochures that were disseminated to PADI members and that Horsell knew that when it submitted the brochure to PADI, it would distribute the brochure to members. However, he contended that what was stated in the brochure, even if it is later found by me to be incorrect, does not amount to a breach of duty, since it reflected Horsell's understanding of the cover provided, which it was entitled to arrive at. Mr Martin contended that the defendants had not established that Horsell were negligent in any regard. 

175Mr Martin submitted that the defendants had failed to demonstrate that it was unreasonable for Horsell not to advise them that the policy did not, or would not, cover ""sightseeing"" or the use of watercraft for no reward. He relied on the following: 

(1)representations made by Liberty that the Master Policy had been prepared in accordance with a quotation that contained an endorsement ""Watercraft inclusion for craft up to 12 meters""; and 

(2)that exclusion clause 7.18.2 applied only to watercraft that exceeded 12 metres. 

176He submitted that there was no evidence that Horsell was aware that ""sightseeing"" or the use of watercraft for no reward was not covered and noted that Mr Duffy was not cross-examined on this. He contended that it was not something that was so obvious that a failure to recognize it ought be regarded as negligent: Heydon v NRMA Limited (2000) 51 NSWLR 1 at 53, 117, 236; Boland v Yates Property Corporation Pty Ltd (1999) 167 ALR 575 at 658 - 9. 

177Mr Martin also relied on the Civil Liability Act 2002 s 5D(1) which provides: 

""(1) A determination that negligence caused a particular harm comprises the following elements: 

(a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and 

(b) that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person's liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability)."" 

178He submitted that the defendants have not established that they would have acted any differently if they had been advised about those matters. He contended that if I were disinclined to accept Mr Todd's evidence as to the purpose of the trip, I should also reject the evidence of Mr Todd on which Mr Birch relied to establish causation. 

Whether Horsell's failure to advise the defendants on certain matters amounted to a breach of duty 

179I consider that the circumstances surrounding the relationship between PADI and its members on the one hand, and Horsell on the other was sufficient to create a contract of retainer and impose a duty of care on Horsell. In my view, it is tolerably clear that PADI had engaged Horsell to advise it, and its members, on appropriate insurance cover, and, by implication, to warn it and its members where cover was inadequate or doubtful. 

180I reject Mr Martin's submission that there was no relevant representation made in the facsimile dated 3 March 2003. Where a broker refuses to quote on a liability policy for a vessel because the liability to third parties is said to be covered by another policy, the broker is effectively advising that the insured does not need the liability policy for the vessel. Although the facsimile did not state that the cover for watercraft up to 12 metres was unlimited, the only limitations on cover which were identified were that the activities be associated with diving, swimming, sightseeing, whale-watching and fishing. Mr Todd was not warned of the limitation that appeared in the insuring clause in Master Policies that were in evidence namely that it covered matters ""in connection with the Insured's Business"". 

181The representations in the Watertight Policy brochure were even stronger since they intimated to readers that they would have public liability insurance for boats less than 12 metres in length through the Watertight Policy, and did not warn potential policy holders that not all activities undertaken in such boats would be covered by the policy. 

182I consider that it was incumbent on a reasonably competent broker, in circumstances where the broker had earlier advised a client that it did not need public liability insurance for its boat, to advise the client that the Watertight Policy would not cover all activities undertaken in such boats, but only those related to scuba diving and associated activities and which were conducted in connection with its business. Such a broker ought to have advised the client that Protection & Indemnity insurance for boats was available and could be obtained to cover risks not covered by the Watertight Policy. It breached the duty it owed to Dive Two to point out the legal pitfalls that might arise for the insured: Fanhaven Pty Ltd v Bain Dawes Northern Pty Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 57 at 62, per Huntley JA. Horsell was negligent and in breach of its implied retainer by failing to warn Dive Two of a potential deficiency in the policy which could be rectified by obtaining the policy that Dive Two had previously had to provide public liability insurance in respect of Dive One. 

183In making these findings I am conscious of the fact that it is usual in such cases that there be evidence from a broker deposing to the standards to be expected of reasonably competent brokers. Although it cannot be said that the construction of the insuring clause in the instant case is an obvious or easy matter, the words of the insuring clause ""in connection with the Insured's Business"" are such as, in my view, to put a reasonably competent broker on notice that there was at least a substantial risk that those private, non-business activities would not be covered by the policy. As was said in Geoffrey W Hill & Associates (Insurance Brokers) Pty Limited v Squash Centre (Allawah North) Pty Limited [1996] ANZ Ins Cases 61-012, expert evidence is not required where the matter is obvious, as I consider this matter to be. 

184I do not consider that these were matters which Mr Birch was obliged to put to Mr Duffy, since it was clear from the pleadings that the defendants alleged breach of retainer and breach of duty of care. 

185In order to ascertain to what damages, if any, the defendants are entitled, it is necessary to consider the position that they would have been in, either had the contract of retainer been performed or the negligence not been committed. 

186I accept Mr Birch's submissions that Mr Todd had shown himself to be prudent and conservative when it came to obtaining insurance. His evidence, which I accept, as to the various policies of insurance that he took out on behalf of Dive Two and on his own account (including in respect of his role as Dive Master) from time to time shows that he was risk averse as far as his business was concerned. He arranged insurance for the boat when he transported it from Victoria to New South Wales. When the business started to operate, he obtained business insurance. He also appreciated that he would need public liability insurance in respect of the boat. 

187I accept Mr Todd's evidence that he cancelled the Protection and Indemnity aspect of the hull insurance as a result of advice given by an employee of PADI. This advice was reiterated in the PADI Watertight brochures that were written and published by Horsell, extracts of which are set out above. 

188I find that had Mr Todd been advised that there was a risk that the Watertight Policy would not cover him for public liability if he used the boat for purposes unrelated to scuba diving and associated activities, or unconnected with the business of Dive Two, he would have taken out public liability insurance for the relevant period to cover the activities of Dive One. 

189The evidence of Mr Duffy establishes that such insurance was commercially available at the relevant time at a cost that was broadly commensurate with the premium of other policies that Mr Todd had taken out. Accordingly, there is no proper basis on which I could find that the cost of such insurance was so prohibitive that Mr Todd would have chosen to take the risk of a claim associated with the boat, rather than pay the premium. 
Conclusion and orders 

190In determining that Horsell's negligence caused the defendants' loss (through Liberty's denial of indemnity, which I have found to be justified), I am satisfied that Horsell's negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm, and that it is appropriate for Horsell's liability to extend to such harm. 

191It was not submitted that I should distinguish between any element of the claim against Liberty for insurance in calculating the damages for which Horsell is liable to the defendants. Because I have found that the sole reason Liberty is not liable to pay the defendants is because the claim did not arise ""in connection with the Insured's Business"", I consider that a public liability policy associated with the boat that did not have that limitation would have responded to each of the three aspects to the claim made by the defendants. 

192Accordingly, the judgment sum will be the sum of the three monetary elements already determined, namely: the amount of the judgment given in favour of the plaintiff, the $5,500 compensation paid to Mr Page and the $11,275 fee in respect of representation in the negligent naviation proceedings, to which amount needs to be added the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings when such amount is determined by agreement or assessment. 

193I consider that it was reasonable for the defendants to bring cross-claims against both Liberty and Horsell. For the defendants to elect to sue one cross-defendant rather than the other would not only have put it in an invidious position had it eventuated that it had sued the wrong one, but it would also have been at odds with the principle that all issues in dispute between parties ought be determined in the one set of proceedings. Accordingly, I consider that it is appropriate that Horsell pay the costs of the defendants and of Liberty. I have already ordered that the defendants pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, and note that these costs form part of the defendants' cross-claim. I have not heard full argument on the question of costs, although Mr Birch submitted that this would be an appropriate order. Accordingly, I propose to make provision for the parties to approach the court to have the matter listed for argument on costs, if any party wishes to contend that the costs order I have proposed ought not be made. 

194Accordingly, the orders I make are: 

(1)Judgment for the second cross-defendant on the cross-claim. 

(2)The parties are to deliver to my chambers a minute of judgment reflecting the above reasons when the amount of the plaintiff's costs has been agreed or assessed so that that amount can be included in the judgment sum. 

(3)Direct that any application that the costs order should be other than an order that the first cross-defendant pay the cross-claimants' and the second cross-defendant's costs of the cross-claim be made within seven days of the date of this order. 

(4)If no such application is made within seven days, the order of the Court will be that the first cross-defendant pay the cross-claimants' and the second cross-defendant's costs of the cross-claim.

		29 February 2012",2012-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708567,Van Eeden v R [2012] NSWCCA 18,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : I agree with Schmidt J that the application for leave to appeal against sentence in this matter should be refused. I also agree with her reasons, but would add the following. 

2Ground 3 complained that the sentencing judge had undervalued the adverse effect of the sentence on the applicant's life in Australia following his arrest. That ground did not in terms identify any challenge based on failure to take into account the effect on his family or dependants, as required s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Nevertheless, that provision was relied upon by the applicant in submissions. 

3As explained by Spigelman CJ in Togias , this provision has long been construed as precluding a sentencing judge from giving ""substantial"" weight to such considerations, absent exceptional circumstances: Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; 127 A Crim R 23 at [13]-[16]. Some of the authorities referred to in Togias date from a period when courts were more willing than is the case today to assume that legislation was not intended to depart from general law principles: Malika Holdings Pty Ltd v Stretton [2001] HCA 14; 204 CLR 290 at [27]-[30] (McHugh J). Nevertheless, as Spigelman CJ also noted, it is not for this Court now to depart from a position adopted by appellate courts in most States: see also R v Matthews (1996) 130 FLR 230 at 233-234 (Phillips CJ, Southwell and Hampel AJJA agreeing). 

4That is not to say that the legislative direction is to be flouted by ignoring the consideration in cases lacking exceptional circumstances: it merely means that the accepted sentencing range for a particular offence is likely to have incorporated the usual expected consequences for dependants and that the effect of any unusual consequences, shown to be probable, will depend on all the other circumstances, including the seriousness of the offence. 

5A typical case in which the effect on dependants may be given significant weight is one in which the offender is a mother with a baby or young child in her care. In the present case, the applicant's wife has no doubt lost a period of co-habitation with him and the children will have lost contact with their father who was, possibly, the principal breadwinner, for the period of his incarceration. These consequences may be accepted as probable, not because they were addressed in the evidence, but because they are the usual consequences of incarceration of a person in the position of the applicant. It follows that, in accordance with the established principles, they could not significantly affect the length of the sentence imposed. 

6So far as a general complaint was made that the sentence was excessive, reliance was placed in submissions primarily on the errors, described as significant, which had already been addressed in other grounds. 

7There were three factors which were potentially favourable to the applicant in respect of this ground. The first was the finding that he was to be sentenced as a courier and not as a principal, although that classification was of limited relevance in respect of an offence involving dealing in money where there is a risk that the money ""will become an instrument of crime"". Secondly, he entered an early plea of guilty indicating a wish to facilitate the course of justice. The sentencing judge did not indicate the extent of any diminution in the sentence which might have followed from that fact, but it can be assumed to have been significant. Thirdly, although the amount involved was a significant sum, it was in the middle of the range covered by this particular offence. 

8The maximum penalty for the offence was 10 years imprisonment. In those circumstances, the sentence imposed does not itself demonstrate any manifest excess. 

9RS Hulme J : I agree with Schmidt J. 

10Schmidt J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed upon him by Solomon DCJ on 15 December 2010. On 1 November 2010, the applicant entered a plea to a charge brought under s 400.4(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years, 1 month to date from 15 December 2010, expiring on 14 January 2014, with a non-parole period of 1 year, 10 months. In fixing that sentence his Honour indicated that he had taken into account that the offender had spent approximately 2 months in custody. 

11The charge to which the applicant entered the plea was: 

""On or about 12 October 2009 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did deal with money where there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime and was reckless as to the fact that there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime and at the time of the dealing the value of the money was $100,000 or more."" 


12The maximum penalty for the offence, which is concerned with amounts ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000, was 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $66,000. 

Grounds of Appeal 

13The grounds of appeal are: 

""1. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were neutral. 

2. The sentencing judge engaged in speculation as to the source of the money and thereby fell in to error. 

3. The sentencing judge undervalued the onerous nature of the Criminal Justice Visa and the life of the applicant since the date of charging. 

4. The sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge was too severe having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence. "" 


The sentencing Judgment 

14His Honour referred to agreed facts which were in evidence. In October 2009, the applicant checked in at Sydney International Airport for a flight to Germany. He filled in an outgoing passenger card, declaring that he was not taking $10,000 or more out of the country. When approached by an Australian Customer Border Protection officer, he said that he was not carrying more than $10,000 or the foreign equivalent. When approached again later, he admitted that he was carrying excess currency. He then filled out an International Currency transfer report, disclosing that he was taking $1,500, USD worth $10,000 and EUR2,000. He said that he had no other undeclared currency. A search of his baggage located a large quantity of Australian banknotes. The cash found had a value of $432,268, which had not been declared. The total currency was $418,000, USD10,000, EUR2,000 and CLP1,000 (Chilean Pesos). 

15His Honour accepted that although there had been a history of delay, (as the result of the initial laying of a different charge, which was withdrawn), the applicant had entered a plea at the earliest opportunity and that this indicated a wish to facilitate the course of justice, as well as a degree of contrition. 

16His Honour took the view that the offence was a serious one, requiring both general and specific deterrence to feature in the sentence imposed. He had regard to the provisions of s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and referred to various of the matters there specified to be taken into account. His Honour was satisfied that the applicant was a courier, not a principal. He found that the source of the money was unclear, but noted that an element of the offence was that there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime. 

17His Honour noted the applicant's character and antecedents, also noting that the applicant had not given evidence. He referred to a pre-sentence report which referred to the 54 year old applicant's 6 marriages, 6 children and 6 grandchildren; his marriage for 13 years to his current wife and their two children aged 10 and 5 years; and his residence in the Dominican Republic for about 20 years, where he had conducted businesses, describing himself as an 'entrepreneur'. 

18His Honour indicated that he was 'neutral ' as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, although noting in his favour the plea. He accepted the submission that the applicant's family had been unable to visit him since his arrest in October 2009 and that this must have caused hardship and pain to his family. He also accepted the submission that since his arrest he had been unable to leave Australia, having been the subject of a criminal justice visa, the conditions of which were onerous and prevented him from obtaining employment, or receiving social security whilst on bail. His Honour also accepted that the applicant was impecunious and relying on the charity of others, while in Australia. 

19His Honour concluded that no other sentence than a term of full-time imprisonment was available in the circumstances, the applicant's criminality being significant. 

The evidence 

20The applicant did not give evidence. As well as the agreed statement of facts there was a pre-sentence report prepared in December 2010, which noted that the applicant had stated that he was 'currently residing with a friend [in] Enmore, although prior to this he was renting a property in Mosman and then St Leonards.' 

21The report noted that the applicant gave a background of having been raised as an only child in Holland by his adopted parents, now deceased, who provided for him financially and with a good education. He had not completed a degree in mathematics at university, but had then worked with his grandfather, who owned a cleaning business. He was an entrepreneur who had owned and managed a number of businesses, including a taxi company, nightclubs and a construction company. In the Dominican Republic he had purchased a second hand tyre company about 13 years previously, which had been successful, but had closed down, due to his being in Australia. 

22Under the heading 'Attitude to the Offence' and 'Summary and Community Based Sentencing Options' it was observed: 

""Mr Van Eeden claimed that he made an impulsive decision to travel to Australia for a short holiday after learning about the country on the discovery channel. He claimed that he did not declare the currency because he ""wanted to avoid tax"". He also maintained that $10,000 was from a win on the poker machines and the rest of the money was given to him by a Dutch male associate to take home to the Dominican Republic for him. 

... 

""Mr Van Eeden does not have any prior contact with this Service although enquiries indicated that he has previously served two custodial sentences in the Netherlands. It was difficult to obtain a comprehensive picture of Mr Van Eeden and his lifestyle given that this service was not able to speak to anyone of significance other than a friend he has met while in Sydney, or to verify any information provided by him in relation to this report. He maintained that he committed the offence in order to avoid tax and as a favour to an associate he had met in Australia. He acknowledged that this decision has negatively impacted on him and his family."" 


Ground 1- the sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were neutral 

23It was the applicant's case that his Honour erred in the conclusion reached, failing to have regard to the evidence that he had been a productive member of the Dominican Republic, where he had resided for some 20 years. He had a limited criminal history, restricted to 2 custodial sentences in the Netherlands. He also had a productive work record and had raised a family. 

24There had been a long gap in offending which ought to have been accepted as a basis for inferring that there were reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and that the applicant was unlikely to offend in future. This was not a case of a continuing attitude of disobedience, so that more weight should have been given to retribution, personal deterrence or protection of the community. 

25It was also relevant that the offender was granted bail on 2 December 2009 and had not offended while he remained in the community until 15 December 2010. This period of post arrest rehabilitation ought also to have led to a positive finding in respect of rehabilitation. 

26On the Crown's case, his Honour's neutral conclusion as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation was unduly favourable to the applicant. The evidence did not establish a 'gap' in offending, nor did it show there was no continuing attitude of disobedience to the law, as the dates of the offences were not established on the evidence. The applicant had proffered an inherently implausible explanation of the circumstances of the offence and had not given evidence. The reference in the pre-sentencing report to his criminal record was not the subject of detailed submissions, nor any reference in the judgment. It followed that the evidence provided no foundation for the complaints advanced. 

27The Crown's submissions must be accepted. The applicant led no evidence. The material in the pre-sentencing report provided no basis for any firm conclusions as to the applicant having positive prospects of rehabilitation, particularly having in mind the applicant's implausible, untested explanation of the circumstances of his offending. No error has been shown and this ground of appeal must accordingly fail. 

Ground 2- The sentencing judge engaged in speculation as to the source of the money and thereby fell into error 

28It was submitted for the applicant that it was not open to his Honour to make any assumptions about the source of the money found in his possession. The offence was committed as soon as the applicant falsely completed the outgoing passenger card. Reference was made to some particular exchanges with defence counsel during the course of submissions, to demonstrate that the result of his Honour's approach was that the sentencing process was infected with error. 

29Section 400.4(2) of the Code provides: 
""(2) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
(b) either: 
(i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 
(ii) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 
(c) the person is reckless as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 
(d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more. 
Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years, or 600 penalty units, or both."" 


30By his plea the applicant acknowledged that he was guilty of the offence charged. He gave no evidence and the only explanation he offered as to the source of the money which he was carrying, was implausible. There was more than the one exchange relied upon about this issue during the course of the submissions made below. His Honour's judgment makes it clear that his Honour did not wrongly speculate about the source of the money, but properly took into account the relevant element of the offence to which the applicant had pleaded guilty. His Honour observed: 

""As to the nature and circumstances of the offence I am satisfied that the offender was not a principal and that the offender was a courier of the money. 

I note that the source of the money is unclear however an element of the offence is that there is a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime."" 


31That conclusion was open and reflected no error. It follows that this ground of appeal was also not established. 

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge undervalued the onerous nature of the criminal justice visa and the life of the applicant since being charged 

32The applicant was arrested on 12 October 2009 and granted bail on 2 December 2009, spending 7 weeks in custody. On 27 January 2010, he was granted a criminal justice visa, which will be revoked on completion of sentence, when it appears that the applicant will be deported. 

33The result was that while on bail the applicant was prevented from leaving Australia, where his family was unable to visit him and where he was unable to support himself. It was submitted for the applicant in written submissions, that in his judgment his Honour had paid 'lip service' to these matters, with the result that the sentence did not adequately reflect the onerous nature of the visa, up to the time of sentence. In oral submissions the consequences of his inability to leave Australia and his isolation from his family were emphasised as having been given insufficient weight. 

34It was the case advanced for the applicant below that the onerous conditions of the visa would be taken into account in determining sentence. On appeal it was accepted that his Honour indicated that while those conditions were not tantamount to a prison sentence, they were a factor which he would take into account. His Honour also observed: 

""The conditions of a Criminal Justice Visa are onerous and the offender has not been able to obtain employment nor receive any social security benefits whilst on bail. I accept the submission that the offender is presently impecunious and has relied on the charity of others during his stay in Australia."" 


35Despite this it was argued that the sentence imposed did not adequately reflect the effect of the visa, which prevented the applicant from leaving Australia, the position of his family, the collapse of his business and the need for him to rely on charity, having been precluded from obtaining employment or receiving social security. 

36Again, the Crown contended that there was no substance to this ground and that to the contrary, his Honour had been unduly favourable to the applicant, particularly in the account taken of the matters specified in s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act , which provides: 

""(p) the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants"" 


37In R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; [2002] 134 A Crim R 286 it was observed: 

""31 It is now clear that the reference in s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act to the ""probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependents"" should be read as if it were proceeded by the words ""in an exceptional case"": R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522 where many of the relevant cases concerned with the effect on a child of a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the mother are considered in the judgment of Grove J. But each case will, to a very great degree, depend upon its own facts involving an evaluation of the seriousness of the objective circumstances of the offence committed, the extent of the requirement for general and, perhaps, specific deterrence, and the nature and degree of the impact of the sentence upon the third person. It should be emphasised that the question of whether the probable effect of a sentence upon a third party will give rise to an exceptional case, cannot be considered in isolation from the facts of the particular matter and the degree of criminality involved in the offences for which sentence is to be imposed."" 


38In R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; (2001) 127 A Crim R 23 it was observed by Spigelman CJ: 
""13 His Honour approached the sentencing exercise on the basis that hardship to a child had to be classified as ""exceptional"" before it could be given substantial weight for the purposes of s16A(2)(p). Counsel for both the Appellant and the Respondent in this appeal accepted that his Honour was correct. 
14 The necessity for such an ""exceptional"" effect has long been accepted for sentencing at common law. (See eg R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 per Gleeson CJ at 516-517). 
15 The South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal held that legislation in that State to the same effect as s16A(2)(p) did not affect the application of the common law principle ( R v Adami (1989) 51 SASR 229). The Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal came to the same conclusion with respect to s16A(2)(p) ( R v Sinclair (1990) 51 A Crim R 418 esp at 430-431). This was also the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in Victoria ( R v Matthews (1996) 130 FLR 230 at 233). (See also R v Carmody (1998) 100 A Crim R 41 at 45). 
16 Courts of Criminal Appeal in three States have interpreted s16A(2)(p) as not altering the common law. Exceptional hardship is required. It is important that Courts of Criminal Appeal adopt the same approach to the interpretation of national legislation. Some comments by Dunford J appear to express a different view ( R v Caradonna [2000] NSWCCA 398 at [25]). However Gleeson CJ referred to the South Australian and Western Australian decisions without disapproval in Edwards supra at 517. Subsequently to Caradonna , where he had agreed with Dunford J, Wood CJ at CL affirmed the authority of the earlier cases ( R v Ceissman [2001] NSWCCA 73 at [36]). 
17 If there is to be any change in this position, and that was not put in this case even on a formal basis, only the High Court can effect it."" 



39Again, the Crown's submission must be accepted. His Honour expressly accepted the submission that the applicant's family had been unable to visit him since his arrest in October 2009 and that this must have caused hardship and pain to his family, even though there was no evidence led as to the 'probable effect' of the applicant's incarceration on his family, other than what was revealed in the pre-sentence report, where it was noted that he continued to have contact with his wife, but that his family had been unable to visit him in Australia. His Honour also expressly accepted the consequences of the criminal justice visa, which he also took into account. 

40That circumstances such as this are matters to be taken into account is well settled (see for example Thi Lan Nguyen v R [2009] NSWCCA 181). Nevertheless, what also must not be overlooked are the observations of Hunt J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Lee CJ at CL agreed, observed in R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231: 

""There were a number of subjective facts which the judge took into account. The respondent is incarcerated in a foreign country, living amidst a foreign language and a foreign culture. He is isolated from any outside contact. However, with all due respect to views to the contrary which may have been expressed by others, I do not consider that very much weight should be given to that particular circumstance. 

The fact is that any person who comes to this country specifically and quite deliberately to commit a serious crime here (as did the respondent) has no justifiable cause for complaint when, as the inevitable consequence of the discovery of his crime, he is obliged to remain incarcerated in this country, with its language and culture foreign to him, isolated from outside contact."" 


41This is an approach which has been repeatedly followed. While his Honour did not expressly find that the applicant came to Australia for the specific purpose of committing a crime here, his own explanation of the circumstances of his offence, raise considerations of the kind discussed by Hunt J in this case. 

42It follows that no basis for the conclusion that his Honour erred in the consideration which he gave to these matters was established. This ground of appeal was also not made out. 

Ground 4 - The sentence imposed was too severe having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence 

43It was the applicant's case that the sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances. 

44The maximum penalty for the offence was 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $66,000. The offender was sentenced to a term of 3 years, 1 month with a non-parole period of 1 year, 10 months. He is due to be released on 14 October 2012, when he is likely to be deported. 

45No error is revealed by the sentence imposed. On any view the offence was objectively a very serious one, as his Honour correctly concluded, involving a sum of over $400,000. As well as taking the applicant's subjective circumstances into account, both general and specific deterrence had to feature in the sentence imposed, as was accepted in the submissions advanced for the applicant below. 

46No error has been shown in his Honour's approach to the relevant objective and subjective matters which arose for consideration. A term of imprisonment was unquestionably required to be imposed. As the Crown submitted, in some respects it is arguable that his Honour's approach was unduly favourable to the applicant in all of the circumstances. In the result, it has not been established that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It has certainly not been shown that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. 

47It follows that this ground of appeal has also not been established. 

Orders 

48I would propose that leave to appeal be refused.

		27 February 2012",2012-02-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708571,R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17,"Judgment  1SIMPSON J: Pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) (""the Director"") appeals against what he asserts to be the manifest inadequacy of sentences imposed upon the respondents by Finnane DCJ in the District Court, on 29 July 2011 (Boughen) and 9 September 2011 (Cameron).  2Each respondent pleaded guilty to two counts.  The first count was of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth ( Crimes Act 1914 (""the Crimes Act "", s29D and s 86) between 1 July 1997 and 23 May 2001.  The second count was of conspiracy dishonestly to cause a loss to the Commonwealth ( Criminal Code 1995, s 135.4(3)), between 24 May 2001 and 31 July 2004.  In fact, although the language used in the two counts varies in accordance with the statutory provisions, what was alleged against each respondent was a single conspiracy, encompassing the whole of the period from 1 July 1997 to 31 July 2004, a period which came to be known as ""the charge period"".  The reason that two separate charges were brought lies in a significant change to the structure of the criminal legislation governing offences against Commonwealth law.  A detailed explanation can be found in Agius v R [2011] NSWCCA 119.  3The offence the subject of the first count was subject to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, and/or a fine of $220,000.  The offence the subject of the second count carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of $66,000.  It was accepted, both at first instance and on appeal, that, for sentencing purposes, the lesser of the two maximum penalties ought to be regarded as the outer boundary.  4Finnane DCJ sentenced each of the respondents to imprisonment for two years, to be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order:  see s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act "").  5The Director asserts that, in all of the circumstances, the length of the sentences was manifestly inadequate, as were the orders that they be served by way of Intensive Correction Order.  The facts  6A very detailed statement of agreed facts was put before the sentencing judge.  Also in evidence was a lengthy statement made by each respondent, detailing his involvement in the scheme.  7At all relevant times the respondents were engaged in the entertainment industry, Boughen as a writer, and Cameron as a producer, of television programmes.  Prior to about 1986, both were employed by a well-known television production company.  At that time, the two respondents entered into a business partnership together, utilising a company called Concept Television Productions Pty Limited (""Concept"").  They continued to write and produce television programmes, which Concept marketed to television networks.  8Soon after, they put the management of their business and taxation affairs in the hands of an accountant, whom it is best not to name, to whom I will refer only as ""the accountant"".  The accountant handled those affairs, without apparent incident, until about 1990.  At about that time, the accountant advised the respondents that their affairs could be managed so as to maximise their profits and minimise their taxation liabilities.  The accountant assured each respondent that the arrangement was legal, and exploited ""a legal loophole"".  The accountant introduced the respondents to a scheme that was no more and no less than a relatively simple income tax evasion scheme.  The agreed statement of facts sets out, in considerable detail, the arrangements that were made.  Put briefly, those arrangements involved each respondent and Concept making, against their declared income, false claims of deductions as business expenses.  This was done through companies based in Vanuatu.  The respondents and Concept were provided with invoices for services (initially designated management fees, later designated ""licence"" fees).  The services were never, in reality, provided or received and no licences were ever issued.  Nevertheless, the respondents and Concept made payments to another company, registered in Vanuatu, in respect of the invoices.  The funds so paid (less a deduction in payment to the organisers of the scheme) were returned to the respondents and Concept, but accounted in their business records as loans, and therefore not income, and therefore not liable to taxation.  A Vanuatu-incorporated company, Universal Entertainment Corporation Limited, was formed to operate as the vehicle for receiving, and repatriating, the funds.  9The arrangement was, from its inception, fraudulent.  However, both respondents claim (and the Director accepts) that, at the commencement of the arrangement, they were unaware of the dishonest nature of the scheme, and that they did not become aware of its dishonesty until 1997.  Acceptance of that proposition by the Director, presumably, explains the commencement date of the charge period.  Although the respondents participated in the scheme from about 1990 or 1991, they did not stand for sentence in respect of any dishonest conduct prior to 1 July 1997.  That remains the case.  10Notwithstanding their initial naivety, by 1997, both respondents were well aware of the fraudulent nature of the arrangement in which they were involved.  Nevertheless, they continued to participate until 2004, when they dissolved their partnership.  Over that period of time, Boughen evaded income tax of $520,000, Cameron evaded income tax of $506,000 and Concept evaded income tax of $727,000.  11By 2006, authorities had been investigating this, and other, tax evasion schemes.  The accountant telephoned both respondents and told them to destroy, or get rid of, any records they may have retained.  At the same time the accountant reassured them that there was no cause for concern.  Eventually, in about 2007, investigators executed search warrants on the premises of the respondents.  In December 2008, Court Attendance Notices were issued against each respondent, charging 17 offences in each case.  After some negotiation, each respondent was charged with the present two counts.  Each promptly entered pleas of guilty to both counts.  12The Australian Taxation Office (""the ATO"") has issued assessments of income tax shortfall, administrative penalties and interest.  That issued in respect of Concept is in the amount of $2,235,550.97; that in respect of Boughen is in the sum of $1,817,218.64, and that in respect of Cameron in the sum of $1,819,019.47.  13Although sentencing proceedings commenced on 26 May 2011, the actual sentences were not pronounced until July (in the case of Boughen), and September (in the case of Cameron).  That delay was brought about by the sentencing judge's resolve to impose non-custodial sentences, and the need for inquiry and investigation as to the means by which that could be achieved.  The respondents' personal circumstances  14In the sentencing proceedings, each respondent gave oral evidence, and each put forward a comprehensive case concerning his personal circumstances.  I shall deal with each respondent separately.  Boughen  15In addition to his oral evidence, Boughen put before the court a brief medical report, and an array of testimonials as to his character.  The lengthy statement made by him concerning his involvement in the scheme also contained some information concerning his personal circumstances.  That statement accompanied an undertaking, pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act , to give evidence in any proceedings against Cameron, the accountant, or any other person, and to provide, to the Director and the Australian Federal Police (""the AFP""), such assistance as he was able.  16Boughen was born in March 1950.  At the time he became involved in the scheme he was about 40 years of age; and the time he realised its fraudulent nature, he was 47; at the time he was charged (December 2008) he was 58; at sentence he was 61.  He is now approaching his 62 nd birthday.  A period of two and a half years elapsed from the service of the original Court Attendance Notices; in excess of three years from the execution of the search warrants.  17He began professional life as an actor, but by the early 1980s had taken up writing television programmes, an endeavour at which he had considerable success.  In about 1986 he became involved with Cameron in the company Concept, to which I have already referred.  He has no prior convictions.  The testimonials spoke highly of his good character.  He is married and is the father of two adult children.  As a result of penalties, tax and interest charges he has incurred, it has been necessary to sell the family home.  At the time of sentencing he was living in rented accommodation.  18From 2006 until a few weeks before the sentencing proceedings, he was employed, but surrendered this employment at that time in order to prepare himself for the hearing.  It is apparent that he did this in anticipation of a custodial penalty.  19There was considerable delay in the finalisation of the proceedings.  Of this, Boughen, in his oral evidence, is recorded as having said:  ""I have almost resigned, in fact have resigned on a number of occasions because of these dates which have been set forward for me to appear in court and to deal with these charges and face the charges, I never said that I am never going to plead guilty, I have always done that, I have always said I was prepared to assist.  Those things resulted in me dealing with my family, preparing them, preparing myself both mentally and physically for what was about to happen because I did feel [sic - fear] the worst.  I approached each occasion with a sense of foreboding, but got through it and in work-wise I did exactly the same, I arranged for people to come and take over my roles to assist and make sure the projects and the things that we were working on would continue and I've been doing that for two years, every time we go to court and get ready to go to court and you know the financial drain is quite expensive obviously, but we're finally here.""  20The sentencing judge was told that, in part, the delay in finalisation of the proceedings was brought about by the wish of the ATO for certainty with respect to certain tax rulings then anticipated, and in waiting for a decision of the High Court in a related matter ( Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45), to which reference will be made below.  21From the first return date of the original Court Attendance Notices (10 February 2009), until 11 February 2011, the matters were mentioned in the Local or District Court on at least 13 occasions.  22The medical report is in the briefest of terms.  It states, in full:  ""Michael Boughen is known to have genetic haemochromatosis and has had regular venesections over the last five years.""  Boughen himself explained the nature of the disease as retention of iron in the blood through the liver.  Treatment requires quarterly blood extraction under local anaesthetic.  23As mentioned above, Boughen has signed, pursuant s 21E of the Crimes Act , an undertaking to provide assistance to law enforcement agencies by providing any further information (additional to that contained in his lengthy statement), and to confer with officers of the AFP and the Office of the Director, in relation to the prosecution of Cameron, the accountant, and any other person to be charged in relation to the conspiracy, and to give evidence in any trial in accordance with that statement.  The level of assistance so offered and provided was rated as ""low"".  This assessment did not reflect any scepticism about the veracity or completeness of the information supplied; it was rated as low because the information Boughen was able to provide was already, essentially, known to the investigating authorities.  24Obviously, as matters have eventuated, it has not been necessary for Boughen to give further information about, or evidence against, Cameron.  However, it may well be that the oral evidence he will or might be called upon to give in any trial of the accountant has considerable value.  Cameron  25In respect of Cameron, before the court was a Pre-Sentence Report, his own statement, a medical report, and four testimonials.  He also gave oral evidence.  26Cameron was born in September 1947.  He was almost 50 at the commencement of the charge period, 61 when charged and almost 64 at the time of the sentencing proceedings.  27He has spent all of his working life in the television industry, in various capacities.  He is divorced, but remains on good terms with his former wife, who provided one of the testimonials, and said that she and their children (two adults) did not attend court, at his request, because of the shame he felt.  Cameron confirmed in evidence that this was so.  28He said that, although he entered the scheme innocently (believing it to be legitimate) he gradually realised that it was not.  His suspicions crystallised in 1997, but he could not identify a way of extricating himself from his association with the accountant.  29The delay in proceedings also had an impact upon him.  He described it in the following way:  ""It's been very stressful.  I wake up every morning with this on my mind.  Further to that I was - ATO seized my bank account at some point.  I don't quite remember and I was left with no money whatsoever and my lawyers approached the ATO and asked them to refund some money so I could at least fund my defence to this or my appearances at court.  So I was left with no money and of course no job and it was very stressful.""  30He said that he had used all of his financial resources, including his superannuation, and for living expenses has borrowed against his life insurance.  As to his attitude to his participation in the conspiracy, he said:  ""I'm sincerely ashamed by my actions.  We never set out to create a situation like this and we find it very difficult.  We've been embroiled in this almost - not against our will but against our planning.  We never planned to do it and I regret it.  It's ruined my life obviously and it's had an impact a little bit on my family.  It's been the toughest couple of years that I can recall and it's probably not over yet.  But yes it's been - I'm extremely sorry about what's happened and regret that I didn't have the courage or the knowledge to stop it earlier and confront [the accountant] about it.  [The accountant] was actually a friend ... was our friend and confidant and helped us in many areas and so we trusted [the accountant] implicitly.  [The accountant] had all these qualifications that we believed, which were true actually and so we didn't stop it when we should.  I'm sorry we didn't and now I'm prepared to face the consequences of my action.""  31At sentencing he was in receipt of CentreLink benefits.  32The medical report certified that Cameron ""has a low grade prostate cancer diagnosed in 2005"" which had been managed ""with active surveillance"", and was showing little evidence of progression, but which would require regular monitoring.  33Cameron gave an undertaking to provide assistance in similar terms to that of Boughen; his assistance was rated as ""low/medium"".  Why the assessment was different from that of Boughen is not explained.  However, the low rating is, in his case also, attributable to the fact that the authorities were already in possession of most, if not all, of the information he provided.  It does not appear to take account of what might be the significant value of the evidence to be given against the accountant.  The sentencing proceedings  34As noted above, the sentencing proceedings commenced in May 2011.  Each respondent was represented by senior counsel.  Detailed material explaining the operation of the scheme was put before the sentencing judge in the agreed statement of facts.  The case officer of the AFP, who prepared the documents and assessment of the respondents' assistance, gave oral evidence.  Each respondent gave evidence and was cross-examined.  35The Crown Prosecutor provided the judge with detailed written submissions on sentence, together with references to, and copies of, previous authorities concerning penalties for tax evasion offences.  36He expressly (both in writing and orally) and forcefully urged that the only appropriate sentence was one of full time custody.  37Examination of the whole of the proceedings at first instance makes it clear that, while falling short of saying so expressly, senior counsel for each respondent accepted that proposition.  For example, in written submissions, senior counsel for Cameron acknowledged:  ""15. The offender faces the prospect of being released from imprisonment in his mid-sixties with no assets, no money and no means of supporting himself.""  38However, at an early stage of the oral submissions, his Honour explicitly stated that he was contemplating imposing a sentence that could be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order, which does not involve imprisonment.  (I will deal below with the nature of such an order, which is a relatively new sentencing option.)  39Senior counsel for Cameron seized upon that suggestion, and urged that it was ""open and available"".  Senior counsel for Boughen steered clear of embracing the proposal; he largely focussed his submissions on the role played by the accountant in the respondents' involvement in the conspiracy, and the extent to which the sentences ought to be reduced by reason of assistance to authorities and an early plea of guilty, and to the potential benefit to the Director of the undertakings to give evidence in the committal and trial of the accountant.  For example, he concluded his submissions by acknowledging prior authority to the effect that general deterrence is an important aspect of sentencing in respect of such offences, but urged that the case was:  "" ... one that is deserving of all leniency that can be given.""  40Earlier, he had said, in reference to previous authority:  "" ... it can be seen that the court has considered that the deterrent effect can be adhered to with sentences that involve non-parole periods falling well short of 18 months.  And in my respectful submission this is a case from all the subjective factors ... which would make these men deserving of as much leniency as your Honour can afford in minimising that really effective element of the sentence."" (AB 120).""  41In reply, senior counsel for the Director restated, with considerable emphasis, the proposition that any sentence that did not involve full time custody would reflect appellable error; that was, essentially, because of the need for the sentences to contain a significant element of general deterrence.  42Notwithstanding that urging, his Honour stood the matter over to 17 June, repeating that he was giving consideration to the non-custodial form of penalty.  The Remarks on Sentence  43The Remarks on Sentence are dated 17 June 2011.  His Honour recounted the circumstances of the respondents' employment, and the commencement of their partnership, and their initial contact with the accountant and their introduction to the scheme.  Although he found that:  ""Anybody with the slightest understanding of business""  would immediately have recognised its fraudulent nature, he nevertheless accepted that, initially, the respondents did not.  That finding was in accordance with the stance taken on behalf of the Director, and with the commencement date of the charge period.  His Honour briefly outlined the essential features of the arrangement.  He accepted as a fact that, by 1997, each respondent was aware of the unlawfulness of what he was doing.  That was in accordance with the pleas of guilty entered by the respondents.  His Honour also accepted that, by that time, the respondents were benefiting very significantly (financially) from their participation in the scheme, and that they did not wish to lose that benefit, and so continued with the arrangement.  He accepted that on realising that what they were involved in was unlawful ""they did not know who to go to or what to do"" and ""chose"" to continue.  He accepted that, had the respondents not engaged themselves in the arrangement and paid tax, the amount payable would, by being subject to business deductions, have been ""very much less"" than the amount eventually assessed by the ATO.  44He described the scheme as ""a fairly crude"" one; and in a remark that has attracted some, although muted, criticism (criticism that I would reject) he said:  ""This was just tax evasion on a large scale."" (AB 682)  45He noted the statements made by each of the respondents, and their offers of assistance in the prosecution of the accountant, and the assessment of the value of that assistance.  In a finding reflecting a position he had posited during oral argument (and with which I agree) he placed considerably more emphasis than had the case officer on the respondents' offers to give evidence in the committal and trial of the accountant.  He then mentioned two of the authorities to which he had been referred.  These were (he said) Giles (correctly DPP (Cth)) v Gregory [2011] VSCA 145), and R v Wheatley [2007] VCC 718; 67 ATR 531.  He also made a reference to Hili and Jones (see above).  He is recorded as saying:  ""I am required to sentence them for what they did and I do that accepting, as I must, that the courts have said that for this type of offence sentences are [sic] full time imprisonment are appropriate.  I have considered submissions by each of them and I have considered by the Crown [sic].  The Crown has gone so far as to say that any sentence that saw either of them in custody for less than 18 months would be a wrong sentence.  I am of course not bound by the Crown's view of things, nor am I bound by anybody's view of things other than I am bound by the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I did consider whether I could impose an Intensive Correction Order on each of these offenders.  The Crown has put to me that that would be wrong because the Court of Criminal Appeal has said that home detention, which was an earlier form which existed before Intensive Correction Orders is not to be in any way regarded as equivalent to a gaol sentence.  General deterrence it is said overrides everything and general deterrence requires that people who engage in deliberate frauds should receive full time imprisonment."" (AB 686-687)  46It was incorrect to say that senior counsel representing the Director had made a submission that anything less than full time custody for 18 months would be erroneous.  Senior counsel refrained from proposing any specific term of the sentence of full-time custody for which he urged.  47His Honour determined that each respondent was entitled to a reduction, attributable to his assistance, together with his plea of guilty (see R v Cameron [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339), of 40% on the sentence that otherwise would have been imposed and an additional reduction of 10% attributable to the delay in the proceedings, which he said was of four years (taking as the starting point 2007 when, he said, Commonwealth authorities were aware of the frauds).  That gave a total reduction of 50%.  48Later, he clarified the reduction allowed in respect of assistance, and specified that 10% of the 40% allowed was for prospective future assistance, in providing any further information and, more importantly, giving evidence.  This was for the purpose of s 21E(3) of the Crimes Act .  He made fairly extensive reference to the new sentencing option of Intensive Correction Orders and compared it with the previously existing option of imposing a sentence to be served by way of home detention.  49He mentioned briefly the respondents' personal circumstances.  50At the end of the Remarks, in this context, he is recorded as saying:  ""The big difference between it [an Intensive Correction Order] and a full time custodial sentence in my opinion as someone who has personally visited many gaols including the worst parts of every maximum [sic] gaol in New South Wales - the essential difference between an Intensive Correction Order and gaol is the person subject to the Intensive Correction Order is not at risk of violence at the hands of inmates who could, for reasons of resentment, jealously and anything else decide to attack them.  There is no rationality about gaols.  What happens in gaols is impossible to predict.  People who go to gaol as minor offenders sometimes become extremely violent and dangerous, even in minimum security institutions there can be acts of violence.  I was involved in a hearing some years ago conducted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption.  That was an inquiry into corruption in the gaol system and it became apparent during that inquiry, from the evidence of a number of prisoners that prisoners can organise to have other people bashed by passing messages to other prisoners in trucks going from one prison to another.  I do not see that restrictions of personal liberty, such as are imposed by Intensive Correction Orders, should be denied to someone merely because if he is in gaol he can be bashed or raped.  Perhaps the food in gaol is worse, perhaps their Honours were thinking of the food.  However, I have to say of my knowledge of the food in gaol, on the whole it is pretty good.""  51He stated his intention of imposing, in each case, a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years, to be served by way of Intensive Correction Order.  He therefore referred the respondents for the necessary assessment to take place.  The Crown Appeal  52In the case of each respondent, two grounds of appeal, in identical terms, were identified.  They were pleaded as:  ""1. His Honour misdirected himself when assessing the matters to be determined as to whether an Intensive Correction Order should be imposed on the respondent.  2. The sentences are manifestly inadequate.""  53The written submissions of the Director expanded the second ground to include the following particularisation, asserting that the sentences:  ""(i) are, in view of the term, manifestly inadequate;  (ii) reflect a failure on the part of his Honour to have any, or any proper, regard to the statements of principle by this Court in relation to sentencing in cases of revenue fraud;  (iii) reflect little or no application by his Honour of principles of general deterrence; and  (iv) are inconsistent with the objective gravity of the respondent's offending.""  The Director also asserted, in respect of the first ground, that his Honour erred in taking into account a number of irrelevant considerations.  54I will deal first with the manifest inadequacy ground.  Ground 2: manifest inadequacy  55On behalf of the respondents, it was accepted that the quantum of defalcation is relevant to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offences.  It was therefore urged that the quantum involves the tax shortfalls, as set out above, and not the significantly larger amounts of the assessments made by the ATO.  It was also urged that each respondent should be held liable in respect of only half of the amount of the defalcation by Concept.  56While I would accept the former proposition, I have difficulty with the second.  It seems to me that each respondent is equally liable in respect of the whole amount of the defalcation by Concept.  I do not think this makes a significant difference to the assessment of objective criminality.  It was also argued that, on one view, the losses to the Commonwealth were less than the raw figures above would suggest, because, had the respondents conducted their taxation affairs in a lawful fashion, there would have been an entitlement to various deductions which would have reduced their liability.  57The Director appeared to accept that that was the position.  I also accept it, but, again, I do not think it makes a significant difference to the assessment of objective seriousness.  It is impossible to quantify what the respondents' true tax liability would have been had they conducted their affairs honestly.  58The nub of the Director's case under this ground is that, while acknowledging the uniform line of authority to the effect that offences of tax evasion call for sentences that include a significant component reflecting general deterrence and that, generally, that can only be achieved by the imposition of sentences of full time imprisonment, his Honour did not apply those principles.  59At least since 1996, when Brooking JA said:  ""The seriousness of the offence of defrauding the Commonwealth of a large sum of money by not declaring assessable income has in the past, perhaps, not always been sufficiently reflected in the sentences passed.  Those who systematically defraud the Revenue of a large sum over a substantial period must in general expect a substantial custodial sentence.  The deterrent and punitive effects of that sentence should not be unduly diminished by allowing release from custody at an unduly early stage."" ( R v Van Nhan Nguyen; Huu Duc Phan (1996) 86 A Crim R 521 at 525),  appellate courts have consistently insisted that tax evasion offences ought to attract significantly deterrent sentences.  This, properly, puts tax evasion in to the same class of offending as social security fraud, which has an even longer history of insistence on custodial sentences.  60The earlier occasions on which social security fraud has been treated as an offence calling for significantly deterrent sentences are catalogued in the decision of this Court in R v Mears (1991) 53 A Crim R 141 pp 145-146.  Lee J quoted from the judgment of Street CJ in R v Luu (unreported, NSWCCA 7 December 1984):  ""The courts of this State have uniformly sought to make plain to persons who abuse the system of social welfare that they must expect to face heavy penalties.  The introduction into the administration of that system of overly meticulous preliminary checks before benefits are paid could result in real hardship to persons whose need for benefits is urgent and immediate.  Thus it is that such susceptibility is open to abuse, which results in persons who do abuse it receiving salutary penal consequences at the hands of the Court.""  To the same effect is the decision of this Court in R v Purdon (unreported, NSWCCA, 27 March 1997).  This approach to social security fraud cases has been consistent in this State and others: see eg R v Medina (unreported, NSWCCA 28 May 1990); R v Carroll [1991] 2 VR 509; R v Cameron; R v Simounds (unreported, SACCA, 19 July 1993); Kovacevic v Mills [2000] SASC 0106; 174 ALR 77.  61As long ago as 1985, Olsson J, in the Supreme Court of South Australia, distilled four propositions from then existing authorities.  These he stated as:  ""(1) Offences of this type of now prevalent.  The offence is difficult to detect and penalties should reflect a concern for the protection of the revenue.  (2) Frauds of this kind must be viewed seriously because they threaten the basis of the social security system which is designed to provide financial security for those in the community who are in need.  A deterrent penalty is called for.  (3) It is relevant to regard a continuing series of frauds of this type as increasing the moral blameworthiness of the offender's deceits by way of contrast with single or short term offences.  (4) Whilst it may be proper in cases of first offences of this type accompanied by mitigating circumstances to impose a fine, nevertheless a custodial sentence may well be appropriate in the case of serious frauds unaccompanied by substantial mitigating circumstances."" ( Laxton v Justice (1985) 16 A Crim R 46)  62Perhaps the strongest statement of principle is to be found is to be found in R v Cameron; R v Simounds (supra) in 1993.  Two unrelated cases of social security fraud were before SA Court of Criminal Appeal.  King CJ described the offences therein in question in the following way:  ""In the case both of these respondents the offending amounted to a systematic, deliberate and sustained fraud over a substantial period of time.  The fraud involved planning and sustained implementation.  The offenders, it is true, have no other convictions but that is of little significance when one is faced with such a sustained course of conduct of a criminal nature.  This was not a case of person with no prior convictions succumbing to temptation and being entitled, therefore, to rely upon the previous good record to secure the leniency of the court.  Both of these offenders not only engaged upon a deliberate course of fraudulent conduct, but persisted in it over a long period of time.  The crimes committed are serious crimes.  The social security system is the method by which society provides an income to those of its members who, due to misfortune, are not able to provide an income for themselves. ... Abuse of the social security system jeopardises the system itself and therefore the welfare of all those who depend for their livelihood on the system.  It is the duty of court to protect the social security system against this type of abuse by making orders which operate as an effective deterrent.  Not only does a fraudulent abuse of the system jeopardise the system itself by placing an undue burden upon the taxpayer and therefore, on society at large, but it also is a great injustice to all those welfare recipients who abide by the system, conduct themselves honestly and have to subsist on what is by no means a handsome income ... it is a great injustice to those people if others are able with impunity to double their incomes by a fraud.  For these reasons the court has a great responsibility to protect the integrity of the social security system by imposing punishments for deliberate and sustained fraud which are likely to operate as a deterrent to others who may be tempted.  It is necessary to acknowledge and to appreciate that recipients of social security benefits are, almost without exception, subject to great financial pressures. ...  [His Honour then referred to personal circumstances of the two respondents which, he said, excited considerable sympathy.]  Nevertheless, in cases of this kind, that is to say of sustained and deliberate fraud over a period of time, the deterrent purpose of punishment must be paramount.  The necessity of protecting the integrity of the social security system by deterrent penalties is to take priority over other considerations."" (italics added)  63These observations, and particularly the italicised paragraph, came under consideration by the same Court, constituted by five judges, in Kovacevic v Mills (supra).  Four of the five judges considered that the italicised paragraph overstated the correct position, apparently by placing excessive emphasis upon deterrence.  Their Honours said:  ""39. We agree that in cases of deliberate and sustained fraud, deterrence must loom large in determining the appropriate sentence.  But other matters, especially rehabilitation, must still be considered.  We do not agree that deterrence should take priority over all other considerations, at least if that statement means that there is no scope for the court to be influenced by considerations of rehabilitation in finally arriving at the sentence to be imposed. ...  40 In our opinion the proper approach to sentencing is better reflected by saying that in a case of the type referred to by King CJ an order for imprisonment, with at least some of the imprisonment actually to be served, is ordinarily likely to be required.  This is because the commission of a number of offences of fraud over a period of time makes imprisonment appropriate even for a first offender, because of the seriousness of the offending.  The same matters may require that at least part of that term of imprisonment actually be served, even in the case of a person with no previous convictions.  But there is still a need to consider all aspects of the matter, and to consider the interests of society and of the offender in the rehabilitation of the offender.  Also, in an appropriate case, there may be room for the exercise of mercy and leniency ...  ...  43. In our view in the more serious cases of sustained and deliberate fraud, deterrence is very important, imprisonment is likely to be required, but all mitigating circumstances and the rehabilitation of the offender must still be considered.  Substantial mitigating circumstances, and in some cases considerations of mercy and leniency may lead to the conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment is inappropriate or that such a sentence is appropriate, but that the imprisonment need not be served.""  64The Court then referred to a submission made in that case concerning relative sentences in cases of taxation fraud and social security fraud and added:  ""47. Our firm view is that there is no reason for the courts of this State to take a less strict approach to revenue fraud [ie tax fraud] than is taken to social security fraud.  If anything, cases of revenue fraud are likely to attract heavier penalties because often the fact of poverty or pressing need, found in a number of cases of social security fraud, will be absent.""  65The last observation, while obiter dicta , is consistent with observations I made in 1999 in R v Hart , NSWCCA, unreported, 23 July 1999.  66The statements of principle concerning social security fraud set out above are not different from the statements of principle to be found in cases involving fraud on the revenue by means of the taxation system.  Their application in the latter class of case may have been somewhat less rigorous.  67With respect to taxation offences, the rationale for the imposition of severe sentences has been stated in a number of different ways.  See, for example, R v Caradonna [2000] NSWCCA 398 at [24], where it was pointed out that tax fraud is a fraud on all other taxpayers.  In DPP (Cth) v Goldberg [2001] VSCA 107, at [51], Vincent JA, with whom Winneke P and Batt JA agreed, said:  ""The maintenance and integrity of the revenue collection systems, upon which the administration of government and the provision of a wide range of necessary services to the community are dependent, is vitally important to the proper functioning of our society.  It hardly needs to be emphasised, from whatever perspective this conduct is approached, the activities in which the respondent engaged over a number of years, must be regarded as extremely serious indeed and his level of personal culpability as very high. ... Those who engage in the type of activities pursued by the respondent must anticipate the penalties properly reflective of the criminality involved will be imposed upon them.  The principle of general deterrence assumes considerable significance in the determination of an appropriate sentence in such cases.""  68I observe at once that the scale of offending in the present case does not come anywhere near the scale of offending in Goldberg .  In that case, the offender had been the vehicle by which other, mostly unidentified, individuals evaded tax amounting to a total of $20 million or more.  But that does not affect the principles stated.  Earlier in the judgment, Vincent JA had cited, with approval, the remarks of the sentencing judge in that case, to the following effect:  ""Tax evasion is not a game, or a victimless crime.  It is a form of corruption and is, therefore, insidious.  In the case of brazen tax evasion, honest citizens begin to doubt their own value and are tempted to do what they see others do with apparent impunity.  At the very least, they are left with a legitimate sense of grievance, which is itself divisive.  Tax evasion is not simply a matter of failing to pay one's debt to government.  It is theft, and tax evaders are thieves.  [The offender's] money laundering was therefore a corrupt activity. ...""  69It is something of a curiosity, that in the face of these, consistent, statements of principle, the appeals (as in Goldberg ) are frequently brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions, reflecting, perhaps, a recognition of principle, but a failure of application.  That is, notwithstanding the recognition of the seriousness of the conduct, and the need for strongly deterrent penalties, sentencing judges find it difficult to impose sentences that reach the high level which they have, in theory, accepted as being appropriate.  70That may be illustrated by a decision close to the present case: R v Wheatley (supra).  That offender pleaded guilty to three charges, two of which were defrauding the Commonwealth and acting with the intention of dishonestly obtaining a gain from the Commonwealth.  The first carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years; the second, of imprisonment for 5 years.  The circumstances of the offending are fully set out in the Remarks on Sentence; it involved loss to the revenue of almost $320,000.  The offender had given an undertaking pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act to give future assistance.  The combined sentence ultimately imposed was of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months, the offender to be released on recognizance after 1 year and 3 months.  This was a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed of about one-third.  71The appellant, the offender, appealed against the sentences; however, on being cautioned by the Victorian Court of Appeal that it could increase the sentences, he abandoned the appeal.  72Another decision is that of Gregory (supra).  The offender in that case was a solicitor who advised Wheatley and was involved in Wheatley's tax evasion.  He was convicted after trial and sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years, to be released after serving 1 year.  The custodial portion of the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed (16 months) was reduced by 4 months because the offender was a resident of NSW, but would be required to serve his sentence in a Victorian prison.  The Victorian Court of Appeal held that that sentence was manifestly inadequate, and that a head sentence of 4 to 6 years' imprisonment would have been appropriate.  The Court further held that the reduction of 25% by reason of interstate service of the sentence was ""excessive and unjustifiable"".  It held that the appropriate range of imprisonment to be served before release was between 3 and 4 years' imprisonment.  73Notwithstanding that, on a Crown appeal, the court exercised its residual discretion and declined to interfere.  Some of its statements of principle, however, are of some importance.  The court noted the passage in Nguyen and Phan which I have extracted above.  It commented on ""white collar crime"", and said:  ""53. In seeking to ensure that proportionate sentences are imposed the courts have consistently emphasised that general deterrence is a particularly significant sentencing consideration in white collar crime and that good character cannot be given undue significance as a mitigating factor, and plays a lesser part in the sentencing process.  In the case of taxation offences general deterrence is also given special emphasis in order to protect the revenue as such crimes are not particularly easy to detect and if undetected may produce great rewards. 'Deterrence looms large' as the present process of self-assessment imposes on the taxpayer a heavy duty of honesty.  Moreover, general deterrence is likely to have a more profound effect in the case of white-collar criminals.  White-collar criminals are likely to be rational, profit-seeking individuals who can weigh the benefits of committing a crime against the costs of being caught and punished.  Further, white-collar criminals are also more likely to be first time offenders who fear the prospect of incarceration.  54. In many if not most cases, imprisonment will be the only sentencing option for serious tax fraud in the absence of powerful mitigating circumstance.  A sophisticated degree of planning accompanied by a lack of contrition should ordinarily lead to a more severe sentence of imprisonment ..."" (internal references omitted.)  Some may find it difficult to reconcile the statements of principle with the outcome.  74Finally, in Hili and Jones , the offenders were engaged in an arrangement similar to that of the present respondents.  The tax evaded was about $400,000 (Hili) and over $360,000 (Jones).  The sentencing judge, having allowed a reduction of 50% in each case in respect of the pleas of guilty and assistance, sentenced each offender to imprisonment for 18 months with a recognizance release order to take effect after 7 months.  This Court upheld a Crown appeal, and sentenced each offender to imprisonment for 3 years with a recognizance release order to take effect after 18 months: R v Jones; R v Hili [2010] NSWCCA 108.  The High Court upheld those sentences: see [68].  75The High Court observed that the chief considerations which pointed to the inadequacy of the sentences at first instance were the nature of the offending, and other sentences that were closely comparable.  The majority in the High Court said:  ""63. The applicants' offending was sustained over a long time.  It was planned, deliberate and deceitful, requiring for its implementation the telling of many lies.  The applicants acted out of personal greed.  The amount of tax evaded was not small.  Detection of offending of this kind is not easy.  Serious tax fraud, which this was, is offending that affects the whole community.  As was pointed out in Ruha [ R v Ruha, Ruha v Harris ex parte the Commonwealth DPP ] [2010] QCA 10 at [45], the sentence imposed had to have both a deterrent and a punitive effect, and those effects had to be reflected in the head sentences and recognizance release orders that were made.""  Those observations transpose precisely to the present case.  76Social security fraud and tax evasion are two sides of the same coin.  In the passage from Gregory extracted above (at [53]), the Victorian Court of Appeal made some observations about common features of ""white collar criminals"".  I may be permitted some similar generalisations about social security fraudsters.  In contrast to ""white collar criminals"" social security fraud is usually committed by those who have access to the social security system.  They are, by definition, almost universally less privileged, less prosperous, less educated, in possession of fewer resources, intellectual and otherwise.  That is the sort of thing the SA Court of Criminal Appeal had in mind in paragraph [47] of Kovacevic extracted above.  But in social security cases the courts have shown less reticence in imposing severe sentences than they have in tax fraud cases.  Attention was drawn to this anomaly by the Queensland Court of Appeal as long ago as 1994:  see R v Wright (1994) 74 A Crim R 152, at 156-159.  Attached to the judgment of Davies JA and Oliver J is a table showing sentences imposed by Queensland courts in respect of social security fraud, to 1994, involving more than $60,000.  Analysis of the sentences imposed in respect of social security frauds in other states, often after Crown appeal, supports their Honours' conclusion.  I will refer to sentences actually imposed, but note that accurate comparison is not possible.  That is because, in many of the cases, the applicable maximum penalty is not stated and, of course, there are invariably circumstances particular to each case that affect the result.  With those limitations in mind, however, I note the following sentences.  77In Luu (supra, a NSW case), the offender was charged with three counts of imposition of the Commonwealth; a further 18 counts of the same kind were taken into account.  The imposition was claiming and receiving social security payments to which he was not entitled.  The amount involved was $62,000.  In respect of those offences, he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 2 years.  However, that case was complicated because those sentences were accumulated upon sentences for forgery and uttering, unrelated to the Commonwealth offences.  Undoubtedly, the principle of totality had a bearing on the sentences imposed.  This Court dismissed an appeal against sentence.  78Carroll (supra, Vic) is another case with its own complications.  The offender was convicted on seven counts of imposition on the Commonwealth, involving $220,000.  The maximum penalty applicable is not stated.  At first instance, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months, with a minimum term of 2 years and 6 months, together with an order for restitution.  The Victorian Court of Appeal, in a judgment dated 15 October 1990, allowed a Crown appeal and substituted an effective term of 5 years and 6 months with a minimum term of 4 years.  It was then discovered that an error had been made in the application of relevant Commonwealth legislation concerning the allowance to be made in respect of sentences imposed in states where remissions of sentence were not available ( Crimes Act 1914, s 16G).  In R v Carroll , the court reversed its earlier ruling and revoked the non-parole period of 4 years, substituting a period of 2 years and 8 months.  79In Medina (supra, NSW, 1990) the sum involved was $45,000.  The offence was of false pretences with intent to defraud.  The maximum penalty applicable is not stated in the judgment.  At first instance a lengthy remand was imposed, with a view to permitting the offender to effect reimbursement.  On a Crown appeal this Court held that a custodial sentence was called for and imposed a sentence of 2 years with a minimum term of 18 months.  80In Mears (supra, NSW, 1991) the offender was charged with six counts of being knowingly concerned in social security frauds, committed by members of his family.  Three were offences carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years; three were of offences carrying a maximum penalty of 2 years.  At first instance the offender was sentenced to a total period of imprisonment of 3 years with a non-parole period of 12 months.  A Crown appeal was allowed, and an effective sentence of 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years, was imposed.  81In Cameron and Simounds (supra, S.A.), the offenders, who were not associated with one another, were convicted of similar offences, of multiple counts of imposition on the Commonwealth.  In the case of Cameron , the period of offending was three years and ten months; the amount defrauded was $26,000.  Full reparation had been made by members of the offender's family.  82Simounds also pleaded guilty to multiple charges of imposition, involving a total amount of just under $18,000, obtained over a period of almost three years.  He was aged only 19 years at the time of the ""substantial part"" of the offending.  83At first instance Cameron was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months, Simounds for 2 years.  An immediate release order was made in respect of each.  84On a Crown appeal, Cameron was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 ½ years, to be released after 9 months, and Simounds to imprisonment for 2 years, also to be released after 9 months.  85In Purdon , (supra, NSW, 1997) the fraud had been committed over a period of seven years and eight months, the offender receiving social security benefits to which she was not entitled.  The amount so obtained is not stated in the judgment.  At first instance the offender was made subject to a good behaviour bond; after a Crown appeal, a sentence of imprisonment for 9 months was imposed, to be served by way of periodic detention.  86These sentences may be contrasted with those imposed on the tax fraud cases to which I have referred above, supplemented by the following.  In R v Morris [1993] 2 VR 192, the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal had under consideration a Crown appeal following the sentencing of a barrister who had failed to declare, over a nine year period, significant amounts of income, resulting in the non-payment of an equally significant amount of tax.  The charges were brought under s 29B of the Crimes Act 1914 , with a maximum penalty in respect of each offence of imprisonment for 2 years.  At first instance he was sentenced to a total of imprisonment for 2 years; however an order was made directing his release forthwith (upon giving appropriate security).  The offender had made significant payments by way of penalty and reparation, meaning that, as it then happened, the Commonwealth did not suffer any actual loss.  87On a Crown appeal, the sentences were set aside, and the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to be served concurrently, but an order was made that the offender be released after 6 months of imprisonment.  88In Hamman (unreported, NSWCCA, 1 December 1998) a barrister in this State pleaded guilty to five counts, three of which were of imposition (contrary to s 29B of the Crimes Act , carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years), and two of defrauding the Commonwealth (contrary to s 29D of the Crimes Act , carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years).  All offences were committed by the understatement of income, over a period of three years.  At first instance he was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years, to be served by way of periodic detention.  Both the Crown and the offender appealed.  This Court unanimously held that such a sentence was manifestly inadequate, and that a term of full time imprisonment ought to have been imposed (pp 24, 26 and 29).  89However, by majority (Sheller JA and Levine J), the Court exercised the residual discretion it retains in Crown appeals and dismissed the Crown appeal.  The principal reason appears to have been delay in the prosecution.  Their Honours then held that error had been made by the sentencing judge in failing to take into account the effect of s 16G of the Crimes Act , and reduced the sentence to one of imprisonment for 14 months, to be served by way of periodic detention.  Barr J, who dissented on the outcome of the Crown appeal, would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 6 months.  In reaching that sentence, he took into account the mitigating circumstances, as well as the principles that then applied in relation to Crown appeals.  Six months was, therefore, the minimum term his Honour considered ought to have been imposed.  90In R v Whitnall (1993) 120 ALR (Full Court of the Federal Court, on appeal from the Supreme Court of the ACT) the offender had, over a 2 ½ year period, furnished false tax returns in his own name, and in the name of a company he controlled.  The amount involved was almost $75,000.  The charges were of fraud, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.  At first instance, he was sentenced to imprisonment (the judgments on appeal do not disclose the term), which was fully suspended, together with some community service.  The Full Federal Court, while acknowledging and endorsing the strong statement of principle concerning sentencing in respect of taxation fraud, dismissed the Crown appeal.  91The contrast in sentences actually imposed in respect of social security frauds and tax frauds demonstrates that what was said by Davies JA and White J in Wright was, and remains, fully justified.  Notwithstanding strong statements of principle, tax offenders are treated more leniently than are social security offenders.  92I now turn to a consideration of the relevant circumstances in the present cases.  93Two features of the respondents' offences strongly suggest more, rather than less, severe sentences.  These are the period of time - seven years - over which they continued, and the amounts involved.  94Other features point in the opposite direction.  These include the health problems of each respondent (although these are far from being at the high end of health problems to be taken into account on sentencing that are seen in this and other courts); their prior good character (although it is well established, as is stated in some of the extracts above, that this is of less significance in offences of this nature); that the applicants have made, or will be obliged to make, reparations (see R v Gay [2002] NSWCCA 6 at [14] and [18]); and the delay in bringing the proceedings to a conclusion (also the subject of consideration in Gay ).  I note that a somewhat less benign view of the relevance of reparations was taken by Sheller JA in Hamman : see p 17 of that judgment.  95Counsel for both respondents urged that significant weight be given to the circumstance that the respondents were inveigled, or lured, into the scheme by an apparently highly qualified, professional, accountant and that their participation was not initiated by themselves.  Had the fraudulent conduct ceased on, or soon after, the respondents' realisation of its true character, this circumstance may have had some weight.  Given that the conduct continued for another seven years after that realisation, its significance is diminished to almost nothing.  96There is undoubtedly a pathos about the prospect of two middle aged men, of prior good, even exemplary, character, each with some health issues, who have expressed remorse for their conduct, being sentenced to imprisonment.  That pathos cannot be permitted to overshadow the objective seriousness of the offences: two middle aged men, intelligent, professionally successful, financially secure, prosperous, over a seven year period defrauded the Australian community of very significant sums of money, leaving others, less financially able to do so, to bear the burden of financing the many services government provides.  The community cannot afford for judges to be squeamish about discharging their duty, however personally painful it may sometimes be.  To fail to sentence middle class offenders commensurately with social security offenders risks bringing the administration of justice into disrepute as perpetrating class bias.  97Careful reading of the authorities discloses that there is, at times, disparity between statements of principle - Caradonna, Phan and Nguyen , Gregory - and what happens in practice.  The language of L Vogel & Son Pty Limited v Anderson, Minister of State for Customs and Excise for the Commonwealth of Australia [1968] HCA 90; (1967) 120 CLR 157, quoted at [14] of Jones and Hili [2010] NSWCCA 108, is apposite:  ""The duty evaded has now been paid, and I understand that when the evasions were discovered the defendants gave the Customs every assistance in their investigations. But when all the considerations relied upon by the defendants have been given due attention the case still cannot be regarded as other than a serious one. Not only are the defendants guilty of a sustained course of conscious wrongdoing, but the offences are in a field in which punishments for deliberate offences must be severe. The Customs laws represent the judgment of Parliament upon an important aspect of the economic organization of the community, and the object of the penal provisions is to make that judgment as effective as possible. It is important to remember that Customs officers have of practical necessity to rely extensively upon the information supplied to them by importers, for the flow of commerce could not be maintained if every importation had to be fully investigated. Moreover, detection of frauds is not always easy. No doubt ordinary conceptions of honesty and of civic responsibility suffice to ensure a great deal of fair dealing with the Customs, but for some people little seems to matter but fear of the consequences of discovery. The Customs Act [1901-1960 (Cth)] makes those consequences potentially drastic. It is for the courts to make them, in suitable cases, drastic in fact, for otherwise traders who are not saved by qualms of conscience from willingness to defraud their fellow citizens may weigh the profits they hope for against the penalties they have cause to fear and find the gamble worthwhile."" (per Kitto J, upheld on appeal, italics added)  98A direct parallel is to be found between the obligations of disclosure in Customs matters, as referred to in that passage, and the obligations of honesty and accurate disclosure of taxation matters central to the self-assessment system currently operating, and of which the two respondents took unconscientious advantage.  99I move from statements of principle and historical data to examination of comparable sentences that have recently been imposed.  I am fully conscious of the limitation of the use of historical sentencing data: Hili and Jones , HCA, at [54].  100The first question to be addressed is whether the sentences of 2 years (however to be served) were manifestly inadequate.  A proper answer to that question is obtained by factoring in the 50% reduction that was allowed in respect of assistance to authorities, pleas of guilty, and delay in finalisation of the proceedings.  That means the starting point was a head sentence of 4 years.  This was in respect of offences perpetrated by a continuous and repeated course of conduct over a seven year period, involving tax evasion in large amounts.  These were not offences that, once begun, proceeded of their own momentum.  On each occasion that the respondents paid a fraudulent invoice, and on each occasion that they received the return of their payments designated as loans, and on each occasion that they signed income tax returns containing the fraudulent information, they acted consciously in perpetuation of the frauds.  I refer again to the remarks of Olsson J in Laxton v Justice (supra).  It is, as I have indicated above, of little moment that the respondents were initially drawn into the scheme by a persuasive, even forceful, professional: these were professional, intelligent men who, by 1997, recognised that what they were doing was dishonest.  The evidence concerning their attitude, at that time, to their wrongdoing was unimpressive and weak.  In his statement, Boughen said that ""alarm bells"" began to ring in 1997, and that he began to worry.  Cameron (at para 97) said that he had ""serious concerns"" and that he discussed the matter with Boughen, but that they were nervous about the accountant and felt ""vulnerable"".  Neither, apparently, considered it appropriate either to cease participation, or to take alternative advice on their positions.  Nor is there any evidence that recognition of the wrongdoing occasioned any particular distress, anxiety, or concern above what has been mentioned.  Notably absent from their statements, and their oral evidence, is any mention of conscience.  101The position is encapsulated in Hili and Jones , HCA, at [63] extracted above.  102In terms of comparable offences, those committed by Messrs Hili and Jones most approximate the present.  This Court considered the sentences imposed at first instance (sentences of imprisonment for 18 months, with recognizance release orders to take effect after 7 months) to be manifestly inadequate, and substituted sentences of 3 years, subject to recognizance release orders to take effect after 18 months.  These sentences were imposed after reduction of 50% referrable to assistance and pleas of guilty.  This Court, with reservations, maintained that quantum of reduction, and this was not interfered with by the High Court.  The starting point, therefore, of those sentences was 6 years, which the High Court held was appropriate.  103Another decision of some relevance is that in Gregory .  The offender in that case was a prominent solicitor, who was convicted, after trial, of two counts of defrauding the Commonwealth and one of conspiracy dishonestly to cause a risk of loss to a Commonwealth entity.  The fraud involved the concealment, by a client of the solicitor (the offender in Wheatley ), of $400,000 in income.  The sentence imposed at first instance was of imprisonment for 2 years, with a recognizance release order after 12 months.  This sentence was held to have been manifestly inadequate.  The Victorian Court of Appeal accepted that a head sentence of 4 to 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3 to 4 years, was appropriate.  Nevertheless, for stated reasons, the court exercised its residual discretion and declined to re-sentence.  104In this case, I am satisfied that the proper application of principle, as stated unanimously in the various authorities to which I have referred, and reference to the sentences imposed in Hili and Jones , (and, more importantly, the reasons given by the High Court for upholding those sentences) establish beyond doubt that sentences with a starting point of 4 years were manifestly inadequate.  The starting point ought to have been 6 years.  Applying a 50% reduction means that the sentences ought to have been imprisonment for 3 years.  105However, the Crown has challenged, not the reduction allowed in respect of the assistance and pleas of guilty, but the 10% allowed in respect of the delay in the proceedings.  I accept that this reduction exceeded what was justified in the circumstances.  His Honour overstated (as four years) the length of the delay, which was as I have set out above at [17].  It is not usual to quantify the reduction allowed in respect of delay, and, in my opinion, it is better that delay be taken into account on the overall assessment of a sentence.  In proposing a starting point of 6 years, I have given what I consider to be the appropriate weight to that delay.  106In my opinion, in each case, Ground 2 must be upheld and the Crown appeal must be allowed.  107That, of itself, necessitates a conclusion that the orders that the sentences be served by way of Intensive Correction Orders were in turn erroneous.  Only a sentence of 2 years or less may be served in that fashion (s 7, Sentencing Procedure Act ).  Ground 1: Intensive Correction Orders  108Even if I had not reached the conclusion that the sentences were manifestly inadequate, I would, in any event, have concluded that the subsequent orders that they be served non-custodially were erroneous.  109First, the use of Intensive Correction orders in these circumstances demonstrates a misconception of the nature of this, relatively new, form of punishment.  Section 7 of the Sentencing Procedure Act was inserted by the Crimes (Sentencing Legislation) Amendment (Intensive Correction Orders) Act 2010, with effect from 1 October 2010.  It is apparent that there has not been time for any significant judicial consideration of the circumstances in which its application is appropriate, certainly not at appellate level.  However, it is clear that the principal focus of this sentencing option is rehabilitation.  In the second reading speech the Attorney-General said:  ""The Bill introduces a new sentencing option - the intensive correction order - designed to reduce the offender's risk of re-offending through the provision of intensive rehabilitation and supervision in the community.  It also abolishes the sentence of periodic detention, giving effect to recommendations from the NSW Sentencing Council and calls from the victims of crime representatives.  Essentially, an intensive correction order is a sentence of imprisonment for up to 2 years which is ordered to be served in the community, where offenders can be subject to a range of stringent conditions including 24 hour monitoring, regular community work and a combination of tailored educational, rehabilitative and other related activities.  ...  While it is not intended to be a direct replacement of periodic detention, the power of the courts to make a periodic detention order will cease upon the commencement of the new intensive correction order.  ...  The restriction of the court setting a non-parole period for an ICO was an essential feature of the model recommended by the Sentencing Council, on the basis that the offender should be subject to supervision and conditions of the order for its full term.  This would ensure that the rehabilitative focus of the order is maintained from beginning to end."" (Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), Legislative Council, 22 June 2010, P 24426 and following.)  110This was a case in which, although the sentencing judge made no express findings concerning rehabilitation, it is plain that rehabilitation is an irrelevant consideration.  There should be no, or minimal, prospect of either of the respondents re-offending.  The entire tenor of the Remarks on Sentence was to that effect.  That in itself renders the use of the Intensive Correction Order inappropriate.  It may be that the removal of the Periodic Detention option has deprived sentencing judges of one vehicle by which to express denunciation of the conduct under consideration; but that is the clear expression of the will of the legislature.  The Intensive Correction Order should not be used as a substitute for that now unavailable option.  111Second, an order that the sentence be served in the community, even with the restrictions it necessarily carries, and any additional restrictions imposed by the sentencing judge (such as abstention from alcohol), is a sentence that has inherent in it a high degree of leniency.  That degree of leniency was unwarranted.  It cuts directly across the frequently stated principles of sentencing for tax evasion to which his Honour was referred.  112Moreover, it is plain that his Honour was led into his erroneous course by his excursions into the realities of life in the prison system.  These were the irrelevant considerations of which the Director rightly complained.  113This ground of appeal must succeed.  Re-sentencing  114By s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, this Court may not, by reason of any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again, impose a less severe sentence on a Crown appeal than it would otherwise have considered appropriate.  That this legislation applies to Commonwealth offences was established in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 upheld by the High Court in Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] HCA 1 .  115However, it remains open to this Court to take into account the circumstances of the respondents since the sentences were imposed, and particularly those circumstances which directly flow from compliance with the orders made.  Accordingly, the court received additional material in that respect.  116Evidence of Cameron's circumstances since sentencing was put before the court in affidavit form.  It is fair to say that, in compliance with the requirements of the conditions of the Intensive Correction Order, he has had to go to considerable lengths.  He was living in a property he owns in northern NSW, where supervision of an Intensive Correction Order was unavailable.  (The property itself is to be forfeited to the ATO.)  For assessment for his suitability for an Intensive Correction Order, he travelled to Grafton, a round trip of 700 kilometres.  On being found suitable for such an order, and in order to qualify, from a residential point of view, he relocated to Sydney.  This involved his daughter surrendering a tenancy on a one bedroom unit in which she previously lived, and taking a lease on a more expensive two bedroom unit.  She has incurred costs of about $3,000; he of about $1,000.  117He has attended a four-week induction programme.  He is required to perform community service at Parramatta each Wednesday, and has to date complied faithfully with that requirement.  I assume that this has been so since about September or October 2011.  He is also required to perform work on two days each week at a charitable organisation, but this appears to be related to his eligibility for a Newstart Allowance from CentreLink, and not to the requirements of the Intensive Correction Order.  118He is subject to regular and random visits from his supervising Probation and Parole Officer, and to alcohol testing.  119It is not possible to recreate the circumstances that existed at the time of sentencing, such as to make it appropriate to impose precisely the sentences that should then have been imposed.  I am satisfied that the quite onerous conditions justify a significant moderation in the sentence I would otherwise propose.  120No sworn evidence of Boughen's circumstances since sentencing was put before the Court, although reference was made, both in the written and oral submissions, to those matters.  No objection having been taken by the Director, I propose to accept what is there stated.  121Boughen has been meeting his obligations since approximately July.  He, too, attended a four-week induction course, and has performed community service on one day each week at Penrith.  He has, however, been able to obtain employment, as a television producer, at a very comfortable salary.  He has also been required to submit to random breath and alcohol testing, and has been visited at his home by supervising officers.  122He has been declared bankrupt, on his own petition, and, from his salary, pays a considerable sum to his trustee.  While that fact was put before the Court in relation to events since the making of the Intensive Correction Order, it is a direct result of his offences, and not attributable, or relevant, to the consequences of the first instance sentencing.  123Although the disruption to Boughen's life, and that of his family, has not been as great as is the case in relation to Cameron, his compliance with the terms of the Intensive Correction Order has been over a considerably longer period.  It also warrants moderation, to an equal degree, in the sentences I would otherwise propose.  Moreover, since this appeal was heard on the last day of the 2011 court term, there has been inevitable delay in its finalisation.  124By s 17A of the Crimes Act , a court is not to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a federal offence, unless, having considered all other options, it is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.  I have considered the sentencing options available.  I am satisfied that no sentence other than one of imprisonment is appropriate in the circumstances of these cases.  125Re-sentencing presents an unusual complication.  As set out above, each respondent pleaded guilty to two charges.  However, as explained above, that was solely because of the peculiarities of the structuring and restructuring of Commonwealth criminal legislation.  It is quite clear that the respondents were guilty of a single conspiracy that continued over the whole of the charge period.  Ordinary principles of sentencing would dictate that a single sentence be imposed.  But the existence of two counts, in respect of each of which an appropriate sentence must be passed, preclude that course, and require that separate sentences be imposed, appropriate to the criminality involved in each offence: R v Pearce [1995] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610.  126That, I accept, is somewhat artificial, but is required in order to comply with Pearce. As it happens, the offending in relation to each count was of approximately equal duration, the first covering the period 1 July 1997 to 23 May 2001 (3 years and 10 months), and the second the period 24 May 2001 to 31 July 2004 (a period of 3 years and 2 months).  127In my opinion the appropriate total sentences, allowing for the reduction of 40%, are of 3 years and 7 months.  By reason of the respondents' compliance with the terms of the Intensive Correction Orders and further delay in finalisation, I would further reduce that to 3 years.  That should be divided into equal sentences for the two offences.  Accordingly, I propose that, in respect of the first count, each respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months, commencing on 27 February 2012 and expiring on 26 August 2013, and in respect of the second count, to imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months, commencing on 27 August 2013 and expiring on 26 February 2015.  128Section 19AC of the Crimes Act requires that, when imposing sentences that, in the aggregate do not exceed 3 years, the Court make a recognizance release order.  129I propose that a recognizance release order operate after the respondents have served 18 months in prison.  130I therefore propose the following orders:  Boughen  1. Crown appeal allowed, sentences imposed below quashed;  2. In lieu thereof the offender be sentenced as follows:  (i) Count 1: imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months, commencing on 27 February 2012 and expiring on 26 August 2013;  (ii) Count 2: imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months, commencing on 27 August 2013 and expiring on 26 February 2015;  3. On the expiration of 18 months (26 August 2013) the offender be released, upon giving security, without surety, by recognizance, to the satisfaction of the Court, that he will comply with the conditions specified in s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914.  Cameron:  1. Crown appeal allowed, sentences imposed below quashed;  2. In lieu thereof the offender be sentenced as follows:  (i) Count 1: imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months, commencing on 27 February 2012 and expiring on 26 August 2013;  (ii) Count 2: imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months, commencing on 27 August 2013 and expiring on 26 February 2015;  3. On the expiration of 18 months (26 August 2013) the offender be released, upon giving security, without surety, by recognizance, to the satisfaction of the Court, that he will comply with the conditions specified in s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Acts 1914.  131HISLOP J: I agree with Simpson J  132LATHAM J: I agree with Simpson J  **********

2708578,Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : Ms Caroline Byrne died on the night of 7 June 1995. Her body was recovered from the rocks at the Gap at Watsons Bay in Sydney early the following morning. At the time the assumption was made that, like many others had done before her, she committed suicide by jumping from the cliff top. A coronial inquest was held in November 1997. The Coroner returned an open finding in February 1998. 

2Eleven years after Ms Byrne died, on 3 May 2006, Gordon Wood, who I shall refer to as the applicant, was charged and subsequently convicted of her murder. He had been living with Ms Byrne at the time of her death and was the first to raise the alarm concerning her wellbeing. Although suspicion attached to him, and some of his actions at the time caused Caroline's father and other members of her family to have doubts as to whether he had been somehow involved in her death, the objective facts were apparently considered to be insufficient for the authorities to take any action. 

3However, controversy remained. The newspapers wrote articles about the case. The applicant was interviewed on the television program ""Witness"" in 1998 and the matter was raised in the State Parliament. 

4At the time of Ms Byrne's death, the applicant was employed by Mr Rene Rivkin. Rivkin was a person whose personal and professional life attracted publicity, not all of which was favourable. There were suggestions that a fire at a business in which he had an interest, the Offset Alpine Printing Company (Offset Alpine), may have been deliberately lit so that the insurance could be recovered. The rumours surrounding Offset Alpine linked Rivkin with Mr Graham Richardson, a former member of the Australian Parliament who was a person who attracted significant publicity. 

5There is some evidence which the Crown argued placed the applicant and Ms Byrne in Robertson Park, adjacent to the Gap, between 1 pm and 3 pm in the afternoon of 7 June 1995. There is further evidence (from Mr John Doherty - a local resident) which the prosecution suggests indicated, contrary to his account, that the applicant, with another man, was at the Gap with Ms Byrne during the evening when Ms Byrne died. It will be necessary to carefully consider the reliability of this evidence. 

6There is evidence which may be accepted that Ms Byrne fell to her death at about 11.30 pm. The applicant said he was at home at that time. 

7For a number of years the police were unable to establish with any confidence how Ms Byrne left the cliff top and got lodged in the rocks below. The location from which the body was retrieved was identified by Sgt Mark Powderly, who was the first person to locate her. He descended from the cliff top and was on the rock shelf alone for some time until he was assisted by Snr Const Lisa Camwell to retrieve the body. There is controversy as to whether the location which Sgt Powderly originally identified in 1996 was the correct position or whether it was only in 2004 that the correct spot was identified. 

8There was no eyewitness to Ms Byrne's fall. The Crown prosecutor accepted at the trial that unless the prosecution could exclude the reasonable possibility that Ms Byrne had committed suicide, a prosecution for murder or even manslaughter could not be sustained. There is continuing controversy as to whether she could have jumped or been thrown to the location where her body was retrieved. 

9Doherty did not come forward until some three years after Ms Byrne's death. Although his evidence was important to the Crown case it is now apparent that it was because of the efforts of A/Prof Rod Cross, an engineer, that the police were able to make progress towards a prosecution. Coincident with the request from the police for A/Prof Cross to become involved in the investigation came a questioning of the location at which Ms Byrne's body was found. The position identified by Sgt Powderly in 2004 has been referred to as ""the hole"" or ""hole A"" and I shall use those terms. Hole A is located adjacent to a large pyramid-shaped rock at the base of the Gap. It has been referred to as ""Pyramid Rock"". The location - known as ""hole B"" - was the location originally identified by Sgt Powderly. He confirmed his identification of hole B as the position where Ms Byrne's body was found in a police video made for publicity purposes in 1996. 

10Although it would seem unusual, the police apparently took no photographs of the scene at the time of Ms Byrne's death and the spot where her body was located was not the subject of any contemporaneous record. 

11Although Sgt Powderly changed the location in which he believed the body was found, it is significant that he did not change his opinion as to the point from which Ms Byrne left the cliff top. He said that he identified that point having regard to the orientation of Ms Byrne's body when looking from the rocks back up to the top of the cliff while he was waiting for assistance. He waited for approximately 45 minutes. 

12A/Prof Cross became intensely interested in the problem of how Ms Byrne met her death. Although it had been assumed that she committed suicide, he set about determining whether she could have been thrown from the cliff. Following the identification of hole A in 2004 he accepted that hole A was the correct position of the body and conducted a series of not particularly sophisticated experiments to establish whether Ms Byrne could have jumped or been thrown to that location. The experiments involved strong men throwing women into swimming pools and throwing dead weights, as well as fit and able-bodied young women jumping and diving into pools. A/Prof Cross was satisfied that a strong, fit man could have thrown a woman of Ms Byrne's weight from near the bend in the safety fence on what has become known as the ""northern ledge"" to hole A. A/Prof Cross also produced calculations from which he concluded that a person of Ms Byrne's assumed athletic ability could not have jumped, even with a running start, from the ""northern ledge"" to hole A with a run up of 4 metres, which was the run-up distance which was assumed to be available. However, he calculated that with the available run up it was possible for a strong man, using a ""spear throw"" technique to have thrown Ms Byrne to hole A without also falling off the cliff top as he threw her. 

13There was a debate at the trial as to whether, before they could convict the applicant, the jury had to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant used a ""spear throw"" and that Ms Byrne lodged on the rocks at hole A. It was submitted that without being satisfied of those facts suicide could not be excluded. The trial judge declined to give a Shepherd direction (namely, a direction that a particular fact was to be proved beyond reasonable doubt: Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573 in relation to this and other issues. 

14The actions of and statements made by the applicant before Ms Byrne died, on the night of the tragedy and in later interviews, require careful consideration. It would seem that he lied about some matters. Certainly his behaviour was at times unusual. Nevertheless, the trial judge ruled that the Crown could not use any alleged lie as a consciousness of guilt lie, a ruling about which there is no controversy. There could be little doubt that the applicant's behaviour at the time would have been of considerable interest to the jury. 

15The applicant and Ms Byrne had lived together for some time. Their relationship had previously foundered, primarily because the applicant had been unable to secure significant employment. The relationship was renewed when the applicant found employment as a driver for Rivkin. He boasted of his future financial prospects because of his involvement in the Rivkin enterprise and the knowledge of the operation of ""markets"" which he would gain. 

16The evidence about the state of the relationship between Ms Byrne and the applicant at the time of Ms Byrne's death points in different directions. There was evidence which indicated that the relationship was close and happy. There was other evidence which suggested that Ms Byrne was unhappy and wished to terminate the relationship. 

17At the time, Rivkin was embroiled in the controversy surrounding the share dealings in Offset Alpine Printing. In the weeks before Ms Byrne's death, the applicant had travelled overseas with Rivkin to speak with bankers in Switzerland. On the day before Ms Byrne's death, the applicant gave evidence about the matter to an ASC inquiry. 

18There was evidence at the trial that Ms Byrne was suffering depression at the time she died. She consulted a doctor on the Monday before her death and was referred to a psychiatrist, the appointment being on the following Wednesday. She died that day without seeing the psychiatrist. She had previously attempted to commit suicide. 

19The prosecutor advanced a motive for the applicant to kill Ms Byrne. It was entirely speculative and internally inconsistent. The trial judge when sentencing made plain that he did not accept the Crown's theory. The prosecutor told the jury that the applicant may have killed Ms Byrne because she had told the applicant that she wanted to terminate their relationship. For this theory the Crown accepted that the applicant was in love with Ms Byrne and did not want this to happen. However, it was also suggested by the Crown that the applicant believed that Ms Byrne knew details about the ""Offset Alpine Printing scandal"" which she might disclose to an unnamed person and, if this happened, Rivkin would blame the applicant and he would then lose his job. In effect, the prosecution hypothesised that although it meant killing the person he loved, the applicant chose to do this rather than lose his job. There was no suggestion that the applicant had involved himself in suspect dealings in the shares but it was in effect suggested that he chose to kill Ms Byrne to protect Rivkin. The prosecution called evidence to suggest that, on the afternoon Ms Byrne died, Rivkin was seen in an agitated exchange with the applicant. The content of the conversation is not known but the suggestion by the prosecutor was that Rivkin wanted Ms Byrne neutralised in some manner. 

20The Crown hypothesised that on the afternoon of 7 June 1995 the applicant spent time at Watsons Bay trying to persuade Ms Byrne not to leave him. His entreaties were assumed to be unsuccessful and the prosecution suggested that they fell into argument and many hours later - but still at the Gap - he killed her. Why maintaining the relationship would satisfy Rivkin that Ms Byrne would not disclose any knowledge she had in relation to the Offset Alpine Printing issue was not explained. To my mind there was nothing in the evidence which justified the prosecution's speculation with respect to the applicant's motive. 

21One issue which may have coloured the evidence unfavourably for the applicant concerned the suggestion of a homosexual attraction between Rivkin and the applicant. This issue was no doubt influenced by newspaper accounts of Rivkin's liking for the company of healthy young men. The Crown put into evidence through Ms Byrne's father a suggestion that the applicant and Rivkin shared a one-bedroom flat when staying in London. There was also evidence of rumour about a homosexual relationship between the two men. 

22There are a large number of persons referred to in this judgment. I have referred to the deceased as Ms Byrne and, so as to distinguish from his sons, to her father as Mr Byrne. I have otherwise given persons their full title when first referred to and then after referred only to their surname. I mean no disrespect to any of them. 

The history of the investigation 

23The initial phase of the investigation into Ms Byrne's death was conducted by Sgt Craig Woods. It appears to have been cursory, no doubt explained by the fact that everyone assumed she had committed suicide. The applicant gave a statement to police on 12 June 1995 and was interviewed by Sgt Woods on 10 July 1995. Sgt Woods did not speak with Rivkin. He made unsuccessful attempts to find the fishermen who were known to have been present at the Gap on the night Ms Byrne died. 

24Inspector Brian Wyver first became involved in the investigation in May 1996. He interviewed the applicant on 14 June 1996. He asked A/Prof Cross to assist and, using his knowledge of physics, to express an opinion as to whether Ms Byrne may have been pushed off the cliff or jumped. The request was made towards the end of 1997. Dr Nick Linthorne was apparently asked the same question. They both expressed the conclusion that Ms Byrne may have jumped. 

25A Coronial Inquest commenced in November 1997. In February 1998 the Coroner returned an ""open finding."" 

26The third police investigation was headed by Det Insp Paul Jacob. He was given the job in June 1998. 

27In his book about the matter which was tendered and which I would admit as new evidence on the appeal, A/Prof Cross describes the circumstances under which it was recognised that hole A was in fact the ""correct"" landing spot of Ms Byrnes. He writes in the following terms: 

""I was not 100 per cent certain about the landing spot...I called [Detective Inspector] Jacob in December 2003 about both of my concerns. I asked him how he knew they picked the right landing spot way back in 1996. His answer surprised and alarmed me. He said he didn't know...Fortunately, Jacob immediately saw the importance of what I was saying and arranged for Mark Powderly and two other police rescue officers to visit the site on 6 January 2004...I remained up the top and chatted to Mark Powderly that day. After Mark directed the rescue guys [at the bottom of the cliff] to the right spot to take their photographs, I quizzed him about the morning Caroline Byrne was found."" 

28It was submitted by the Crown that on 6 January 2004 Sgt Powderly directed the rescuers to hole A as the ""correct"" landing spot. 

29A/Prof Cross continued: 

""The day before we were to take the measurements [14 April 2004], Paul Jacob called me with some more distressing news. They were reviewing all their previous drawings and photographs and were comparing them with the photographs I had taken on 6 January 2004 when I visited The Gap with Powderly. The rocks surrounding the landing point in the 1999 photos were not the same rocks as those in the January 2004 photos. The landing point marked on the 1999 drawings and in the early photos had been marked incorrectly."" 

30From these excerpts from the book it would appear that A/Prof Cross gave an incomplete account during his evidence at the trial. At the trial he only referred to the phone call between himself and Det Insp Jacob on 14 April 2004 and not that the January 2004 visit to the Gap was at his initiative. 

31Emails tendered to this Court as fresh evidence confirm that there was email communication between A/Prof Cross and Det Insp Jacob in December 2003 in which they discussed contacting Sgt Powderly. These emails are discussed further under the fresh evidence ground of appeal. 

32Sgt Powderly's evidence at the trial was that he realised the mistake in the identification of the hole from which Ms Byrne's body was retrieved when he watched the 1996 video which was played at the inquest. However, he said that he never told anyone about the inconsistency until he met with A/Prof Cross on 6 January 2004. Given the significance of the assumed landing spot to A/Prof Cross' calculations this is, to say the least, surprising. I would have expected that if he knew that the landing place had been misidentified he would have raised the issue when he first knew of the error. 

33Det Insp Jacob gave evidence at the trial that he became aware that there was some doubt about Ms Byrne's landing spot on 8 January 2004 when he was compiling a brief of evidence for the DPP. He said, ""we received some images, electronic images, from Professor Rod Cross and Detective Michael Streatfield on the email system. Those arose from some work they had done at the Gap on 6 January. Those images were viewed by one of my colleagues, Bianca Comina, who raised concerns with me that they appeared different, the rock formation and the images appeared different."" 

34As it happens the change in the landing position had significant implications for the prosecution case. The applicant submitted to this Court that this was an example of A/Prof Cross ""actively participating in the making of evidence directed to traversing of the existing forensic evidence"" which as a consequence caused the trial to miscarry. 

35Sgt Powderly gave evidence of his recollection of the location where he found Ms Byrne and the position of her body. He said: 

""On the southern side of the body, there was a large sloping boulder and budding [sic] up against that with a narrow 3-inch gap is a large pyramid rock with a sandy coloured point. At the eastern end of that, there is a hole in the rocks and that was where the body was protruding from...(the body was positioned) head down, shoulders down, down to just slightly above the waist. There was no-I couldn't see the arms or the head of the deceased at that time."" 

36When Sgt Powderly first located Ms Byrne at the base of the Gap, he conducted an examination of her distal pulse and found no sign of life. He also detected a ""considerable amount of rigor mortis."" He examined down her legs to the hips but could not find any protrusions of bone or distortions under the skin to indicate fractures or serious injuries; there was no blood or bleeding from the hips to the feet. 

37Sgt Powderly said that his recollection was that in order to see the head area, he searched for a viewing point through the rocks. He said, ""I had to crouch down to a very low point and I was able to look up through like a tunnel effect and I was able to see the left arm a very small portion of the head area."" Due to the danger from the water surging in the area he said that he did not try to put his head into the tunnel. He said, ""My decision not to go in there at that stage because I feared if I got in and got trapped, I had no way of communicating to anyone else."" 

38Sgt Powderly said that when he worked with the Police Rescue Squad he had retrieved ""closer to 10"" bodies from the base of the Gap at Watsons Bay. It must also be remembered that he was giving evidence in 2008, 12 years had passed since the video was made. He first alerted anyone to the error in the video almost 9 years after the event. By the time he gave evidence he would no doubt have rehearsed the scene in his mind many times. 

39Sgt Powderly described the conditions as he waited for Snr Const Camwell to join him at the base of the Gap with extra equipment. He said: 

""At that hour of the morning and in the Winter, it was quite cold and I had some concerns about suffering hypothermia for myself. Prior to her coming down, I had gone and taken some shelter to try and keep dry. The water kept surging up in different areas. I don't know the size of the sea that day but I was conscious of it and that it was quite large, and that a lot of the holes around where - underneath where I was and where the body was, water kept surging up quite strongly."" 

40He formed an opinion that ""she had gone directly in, head first."" 

41Sgt Powderly said that he waited with the body for about 40 to 45 minutes, leaning against the seaward rock as Snr Const Camwell made her way to the bottom of the cliff line with the equipment. Sgt Powderly said this retrieval was unusual. He had not seen a body which had gone into a hole before on any of his other rescues. He was surprised that there was no damage from her waist to her feet. The 40 to 45 minute delay allowed him time to observe the position and conditions. He said: 

""In my own mind, my thoughts at the time were that it was just like a spear...I was surprised there was no damage from the waist to the feet...In this instance it was just - to me, it was an amazing thing that I saw that the body had gone straight into that particular crevice. And leaning back against the rock and looking at where the legs were, particularly that they weren't injured, is where I started looking at - just observations as to where the possibility that the deceased had left the cliff top. And that's why I formed the opinion that it was from basically where the feet were pointing and the legs were pointing in a straight line, were pointing at the edge of the cliff right on the corner of that fence where I conducted the third view with the Mitrolux light."" 

42Prof John Fryer is an expert in the field of surveying and photogrammetry. He made calculations of the possible dimensions of Ms Byrne's body from photographs and some of her personal belongings. He compared his calculations to the measurements of a mannequin who was used to model the scene where Ms Byrne was apparently found at the base of the Gap. Prof Fryer concluded that the shoulder width of the mannequin was 15mm wider than Ms Byrne's likely shoulder width, the total width was 20mm wider than Ms Byrne and the wrist circumference was 8mm larger than Ms Byrne. Prof Fryer concluded that Ms Byrne's shoulder width ranged from 342 mm to 353 mm, most probably 345 mm. However, the armpit-to-armpit measurement of the mannequin was apparently 20 mm smaller than Ms Byrne. 

43The evidence before this Court makes plain that A/Prof Cross placed considerable emphasis on his assumption as to the width of Ms Byrne's shoulders to conclude that she did not end up in hole B. In his fourth report into the murder, which was tendered on the appeal, A/Prof Cross concluded, ""the incorrect cavity (hole B) is too narrow at the base and too wide at the top to allow for any wedging at all. The width of a female across the shoulders is typically about 40 to 43 cm, while the incorrect cavity is about 40 cm wide at the top and narrows to about 30cm at the bottom."" A/Prof Cross's assumption was clearly wrong. It casts considerable doubt, at least on this aspect of A/Prof Cross's thesis. The problem was reinforced in the Crown's closing address. The prosecutor told the jury: ""the mannequin was able to comfortably fit very snugly in hole A but was not able to go into hole B."" 

44A/Prof Cross made a number of written reports during the course of his investigation. They were tendered to this Court. In his first report dated 19 November 2003, A/Prof Cross made calculations and assessments based on the landing spot of Ms Byrne's body as being hole B. His initial conclusion was that ""the most likely cause of death was that Caroline Byrne ran over the edge of the cliff in the dark at a point 8m south of the safety fence. There is a 20 m long approach to this point from the west fence where the cliff top is flat and level and relatively free of obstructions."" In his subsequent reports he concluded that Ms Byrne left the cliff top from a location referred to as the ""northern ledge"" and that hole A was the ""correct"" landing spot. 

45As I have previously indicated, A/Prof Cross carried out a number of experiments to assess whether or not Ms Byrne could have jumped to her death or been thrown. They were not sophisticated and I have considerable reservations about the assistance they can provide. He set up experiments in which cooperative females were thrown by strong men into a swimming pool. His purpose was to measure the speed at which they were launched so that he could attempt to calculate how far out from the edge of the cliff they would have travelled before hitting the rocks below. His experiments were based upon the assumption that the person who threw Ms Byrne was able to take some forward steps before launching her, that Ms Byrne was conscious, not struggling and, furthermore, did not attempt to grab hold of the thrower or free herself from his or her grasp. Apart from the possibility that Ms Byrne was conscious, I do not believe that any of these assumptions are reasonable. Although in his experiments the thrower did not in most cases end up also falling into the pool, the risk of doing so on a dark night with a struggling victim over an uneven surface would have been very great. I doubt that someone would take that risk. 

46A/Prof Cross concluded that the only way that Ms Byrne could have ended up in hole A was if she was thrown by a ""spear throw"" from a very strong man. He said that he understood that the applicant could bench press 100 kilograms. He believed that under ideal conditions such a person would have been sufficiently strong to have thrown Ms Byrne the necessary distance. 

47Once A/Prof Cross had reached this conclusion, it was decided to prosecute the applicant for murder. The prosecution reasoned that this evidence, together with the evidence of Doherty, was sufficient to exclude the possibility that Ms Byrne committed suicide and to implicate the applicant in her murder. 

48Apart from Ground 1, which requires an examination of the entirety of the evidence, the other grounds raise discrete issues including the admissibility of fresh and new evidence and, if admitted, the consequence of that evidence. The grounds of appeal are: 

Ground 1: The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 

Ground 2: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the directions given by the learned trial judge in relation to: 
a. The positive identification evidence of Martin and Melbourne relied on as day time sightings of the applicant and Ms Byrne at Watsons Bay; and/or 
b. The evidence of Mr Doherty and Miss Kingston relied on by the prosecution as night time sightings of the applicant and Miss Byrne. 

Ground 3: The evidence and the opinions of A/Prof Cross caused the trial to miscarry. 

Ground 4: His Honour erred in rejecting evidence showing rocks at the base of the Gap being covered in water, and movement of water over the rocks, as being irrelevant to the trial. 

Ground 5: His Honour erred in law in declining to identify for the jury and direct as to the intermediate facts requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt in accordance with Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573. 

Ground 6: The trial miscarried by reason of the prejudice occasioned by the Crown Prosecutor. 

Ground 7: The trial judge erred both in leaving murder on the basis of joint criminal enterprise to the jury and in failing to identify properly the basis upon which any such verdict should be reached. 

Ground 8: The learned trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to present evidence and make submissions suggesting that the deceased's knowledge of details relating to the Offset Alpine fire was a motive for the offence of murder. 

Ground 9: There has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of the applicant on account of fresh evidence and evidence undisclosed at the trial. 

Ground 1: The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 

Preliminary matters 

49The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides an appeal to this Court as of right in relation to an appeal on a ground which involves a question of law alone: s 6. Otherwise the leave of the court is required including when it is submitted that the jury's verdict was unreasonable: Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]. The correct approach to the determination of whether a jury's verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported has been discussed on many occasions. Most recently in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 the High Court said at [11]-[14]: 

""It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v R [(1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493] by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ: 

Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. 

This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act . In MFA v R [(2002) 213 CLR 606 at [58]], McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'. 

The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say: 

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. 

... 

In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act , by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA , the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated [at 492-493]: 

In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"". 

50The case against the applicant was entirely circumstantial. That is to say, it relied solely upon evidence of facts from which the jury was asked to draw inferences, which in turn were said to provide the foundation for the ultimate fact in issue - namely, whether or not the accused killed Ms Byrne. 

51A case is not defective or bound to fail merely because it relies upon circumstantial evidence to the exclusion of direct evidence. The strength of circumstantial evidence lies in its ability to show that, ""according to the common course of human affairs, the degree of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed"": Martin v Osborne [1936] HCA 23; (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375 (Dixon J). It has been said that ""circumstantial evidence is very often the best [evidence]"": R v Taylor, Weaver and Donovan (1928) 21 Cr App R 20 at 21 (Hewart LCJ). 

52When, as here, the case against the accused is entirely or substantially circumstantial, ""the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused"": Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104 (Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ) citing Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634; see also Plomp v The Queen [1963] HCA 44; (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252. That statement of principle is uncontroversial. It is really ""no more than an amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt"": Knight v The Queen [1992] HCA 56; (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 502 (Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ) quoting Shepherd at 578 (Dawson J). 

53At the same time, the trier of fact must bear in mind that a circumstantial case is to be considered holistically: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48]-[49] (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ). Putting to one side for the moment ""indispensable"" intermediate facts (as to which see Ground 5), it would be wrong for a jury to acquit an accused merely because it harbours reasonable doubts about some inculpatory evidence, though it ignores or unduly minimises other, more compelling evidence of the accused's guilt. As it is often the case that ""one piece of evidence ... resolves doubts as to another"" ( Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] [1984] HCA 7; (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 535 (Gibbs CJ and Mason J)), it is necessary to weigh and consider the totality of the evidence: Hillier at [48]-[49]. In doing so, the finder of fact ought not stretch credulity or engage in tortuous reasoning in order to explain away each and every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence: R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 at [42] (Dunford J); Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55] (Giles JA). 

54The Crown argued that the applicant's submissions ignored the cumulative force of the evidence, contrary to the High Court's warning against doing so in Hillier . It was submitted that the applicant placed undue emphasis on the conflicting expert evidence to keep alive the possibility of suicide: ""That is, [the applicant argued] if it was physically possible for Ms Byrne to do a running dive to wherever she landed, then the Applicant must necessarily be not guilty."" 

55As the discussion below indicates, I do not accept this submission. The applicant pointed to a number of factors, which in his submission, established a reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence. Among these were the unreliability of the identification evidence; the deceased's depression and previously attempted suicide; the ambivalence of the expert evidence with respect to whether Ms Byrne could have jumped from the cliff top or been thrown from there to where she landed; the illogicality of the prosecution's argument that the applicant had ""esoteric knowledge"" of the circumstances surrounding Ms Byrne's death; and, finally, evidence which gave rise to the reasonable possibility that, if Ms Byrne was thrown to her death, the applicant was not the person responsible (either alone or jointly) for the act causing her death. 

56In the analysis that follows, I have resisted any temptation to consider the case against the accused in a piecemeal way. In my view, this is a case where doubts about each piece of circumstantial evidence are reinforced, rather than resolved, by the rest of the prosecution's case. I have also borne in mind the deference due by an appeal court to the combined experience and commonsense of a jury that convicts an accused person on the basis of circumstantial evidence alone: Burrell at [64]-[65] (Giles JA); Chahine v R [2006] NSWCCA 179 at [88] (Johnson J, McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreeing); R v Kaldor [2004] NSWCCA 425; (2004) 150 A Crim R 271 at [2] (Dunford J). However, my evaluation of the whole of the evidence satisfies me that the jury's verdict cannot be supported. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt. Although the jury heard from various witnesses the applicant did not give evidence. I do not believe the jury's verdict can be explained by any advantage which they had which was not available to this Court. 

57The Crown case at trial was that at approximately 11.30 pm on the night of Wednesday, 7 June 1995, the applicant acting either alone, or jointly with a second man, threw the deceased off the Gap at Watsons Bay. 

58In his opening address the prosecutor proffered the applicant's motives. Although proof of motive is not essential to a prosecution case it bears upon whether an accused has committed the crime with which they are charged: HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 344 at [5]. The first motive was said to come from the applicant's concern about Ms Byrne's knowledge of Rivkin's dealings with Offset Alpine about which there were suspicions of dishonest dealings and in respect of which an inquiry had been initiated by the Australian Securities Commission. The Crown prosecutor hypothesised that Ms Byrne was ""about to do untold harm"" to the relationship between the applicant and his employer, Rivkin, thus putting the relationship between the applicant and Rivkin in jeopardy with the consequence that the applicant would lose bonuses and other financial windfalls that he expected to receive. 

59Between 7 and 27 May 1995 the applicant and Rivkin travelled to Zurich and London on business apparently related to Offset Alpine. By this time it had been announced that there would be an ASC inquiry into that issue and the matter had received some publicity which was not favourable to Rivkin. There was evidence that the applicant had suggested to various people that an investment in Offset Alpine (which was a publicly listed company) would bring substantial returns because the insurer was about to pay out on a claim for the destruction of the premises in a fire. Although the evidence indicated that the applicant encouraged others to invest, he did not himself acquire any shares. 

60The second motive advanced by the prosecutor, which was, as I understand it, not unconnected with the first, was that the relationship between the applicant and Ms Byrne had deteriorated to such an extent that Ms Byrne wanted to terminate it and, being distressed at the thought of losing her, the applicant chose to kill Ms Byrne. 

61These motives were significantly elaborated by the prosecutor in his closing address. 

62The admissibility of evidence with respect to Offset Alpine and the availability of a motive relating to Ms Byrne's knowledge of the circumstances surrounding its affairs were unsuccessfully challenged by defence counsel at the trial. The applicant challenges the trial judge's ruling which is discussed below in relation to Ground 8. The trial judge rejected the suggested motive when sentencing the applicant: R v Wood [2008] NSWSC 1273 at [15]-[19]. For reasons which I will explain I have come to the same conclusion. Barr J also rejected the proposition that the crime was premeditated. His Honour found that there was a heated argument on the night of 7 June 1995 resulting in Ms Byrne's death. This, as it happens, was the only finding which the evidence would allow consistent with the jury's verdict. 

63Although, if it be assumed that Ms Byrne was killed by the hand of another, the applicant was reasonably suspected of being involved, the evidence falls short of persuading me beyond reasonable doubt that he was present or participated in a criminal act. Furthermore, the Crown has not excluded as a reasonable possibility open on all the evidence that Ms Byrne did not commit suicide. There is considerable evidence which suggests that she was suffering significantly from depression at the time. The Crown prosecutor accepted that it was an essential element of the Crown case that the jury must exclude the possibility that Ms Byrne committed suicide. 

64There was evidence that Ms Byrne was suffering from depression at the time that she died. She was described by her general practitioner two days before she died as ""very, very depressed."" The evidence indicated that she had previously suffered from an episode of depression for which she was prescribed medication to which she successfully responded. She had previously attempted to commit suicide and her mother died from her own act. The evidence indicated that the fact that Ms Byrne's mother had previously committed suicide was not irrelevant to the possibility that Ms Byrne may have taken her own life. 

The relationship between the applicant and Ms Byrne - 
evidence of problems 

65Ms Byrne and the applicant had known each other for some time. They met in 1991 at a gym where the applicant worked as a casual fitness instructor. Ms Byrne was then a full-time model. They lived together in a flat at Kings Cross for about 6 months but their relationship was troubled and Ms Byrne terminated it. She took this course because of her concern that the applicant did not have a job and his future prospects were uncertain. The relationship was renewed when the applicant obtained employment with Rivkin, working as a driver and performing other tasks. They again commenced living together in an apartment in Elizabeth Bay in early 1994. 

66The applicant and Ms Byrne decided to buy an apartment but needed financial assistance to facilitate the purchase. It was originally intended that Ms Byrne's father, Mr Tony Byrne, and Rivkin would assist with the financing. However, Mr Byrne only agreed to assist if he alone was on the title and his own solicitor did the conveyancing, conditions which Rivkin did not accept. As a consequence Mr Byrne withdrew his offer and Rivkin purchased the apartment in his own name. These events soured the relationship between the applicant and Mr Byrne, who also formed an unfavourable opinion of Rivkin. The applicant expressed confidence at the time that his work with Rivkin would prove financially rewarding and he would soon be able to own the unit in his own right. 

67Ms Byrne and the applicant lived together in the apartment. The applicant was keen for them to be married although the evidence suggests that Ms Byrne was not ready for that level of commitment. In April 1995 Ms Byrne's sister Deanna left Australia for Japan. Before she left Ms Byrne told her sister that she and the applicant had argued because he was putting pressure on her to get married but Ms Byrne did not feel ready to take this step: 

""She told me that she - that Gordon was putting pressure on her to marry. And they had a little argument about it, because she said she's not ready for it, she was still too young."" 

68Between the middle and end of April, Mr Tony Byrne said that he had a conversation with Ms Byrne, ""She said that their relationship was being under a lot of strain because Gordon was putting pressure on her to marry him and she went on to say that, 'No, I love Gordon, and there's nobody else but as you know daddy, I'm quite - happy with my life at the moment. I love my work, I love the modelling and Gordon doesn't want me to work. He just wants me to stay at home and he'd just look after me. And it is putting a lot of stress and strain on our relationship because of this."" 

69Ms Byrne's brother, Peter Byrne, gave evidence of similar conversations with Ms Byrne in mid-April 1995. 

70Deanna, Mr Robert Byrne (the other of Ms Byrne's brothers) and Ms Kylie Watson, a former student and good friend of Ms Byrne, gave evidence in which they suggested that the applicant bordered on being obsessive of Ms Byrne and that he wanted to know where she was at all times and who she was with. 

71Deanna Byrne also said that the applicant constantly called Ms Byrne whenever he was not with her. She said, ""He was constantly calling her. Just wanted to know where she was, who she was with. I found it a bit overbearing."" However she did accept that ""Caroline didn't seem to mind."" 

72There was evidence from Watson that she thought that the amount of calls that the applicant made to Ms Byrne was ""a little bit excessive but that being the age that I was, which was about 17, I think at the time I was still quite young and naïve...but in retrospect it was definitely a lot."" 

73Ms Byrne's former boyfriend, Mr Andrew Blanchette, gave evidence that there was gossip around the City Gym that the applicant and Rivkin were in a gay relationship. Mr Byrne said he knew the rumours were having an effect on his daughter. The applicant, in an interview he gave to the ""Witness"" program on commercial television, acknowledged that there was gossip to that effect but stated that ""I don't think she ever suspected that I was having an affair with Rene ... [but] she probably didn't trust him [meaning Rivkin]."" 

74In the week before her death, Ms Byrne and her father were in discussion about her employment situation. Mr Byrne said that this conversation was disrupted by a phone call that Ms Byrne received. After the call she said, ""I'll have to go. That was Gordon. I have to go. He's in a shitty mood."" 

75Ms Christine McVeigh, sales assistant at the City Gym, said she saw an argument between the applicant and Ms Byrne at the gym on 2 June 1995 (the Friday before she died) at about 8.30 pm. McVeigh said ""I heard sobbing, I looked over and I saw Caroline in the corner...She was pulled back in the corner with her hands up and she was sobbing quite hysterically. Gordon was standing very close to her. I didn't take a great deal of notice of what was being said until I heard Gordon say something quite aggressively to her. "" McVeigh said that the applicant said, ""You're a fucking idiot Caroline."" She described the applicant as ""angry, confrontational, very, very close to Caroline - almost too close for comfort. He seemed to be dominating the situation completely."" McVeigh said, ""I didn't see any physical contact."" 

76McVeigh was certain that there were two other people present during the argument, Mr Gary Redding and his girlfriend, Ms Arianne De Geus. McVeigh said that Redding ""paid for casual entry"" to the gym . She observed them for a few minutes and returned to the reception area and commented to Ms Glenda Williams about what she had seen. Williams confirmed that McVeigh had spoken to her about what she had just seen. Williams said, ""She [McVeigh] said something - I'm not 100 per cent exactly but she said something about Gordon Wood having an argument with Caroline and he was being a bit rough with her."" Williams recalled seeing ""Caroline run out the gym crying"" after having that conversation with McVeigh. 

77Following an earlier ruling disallowing other parts of De Geus' evidence, she was not called by the prosecutor in the trial although he later conceded in the absence of the jury that ""If asked, she would give evidence that she witnessed no such event."" Following an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, McVeigh was cross-examined by the prosecutor to establish De Geus was not there. However, McVeigh insisted she was present. 

78I have considerable reservation with respect to the reliability of McVeigh's recollection so many years after the event. I accept that such an event may have occurred at some time but doubt that, if it did occur, it was on this Friday evening. 

79Ms McVeigh's evidence was contradicted at the trial. Redding said it was not possible for there to have been an occasion in 1995 when he was present at the gym as he had not been there since 1994. He said that he only met Ms Byrne once, which was at Rivkin's home. 

80I discuss later Ms Byrne's movements on the Friday. She had worked that day and was unwell. Watson expressed concerns about her health to an extent which made it unlikely that Ms Byrne would have gone to the gym on that evening. 

81Mr Angelo Georgio, Manager and part-owner of World Club of Fitness, gave evidence that over time he developed a friendship with Ms Byrne. Georgio said: 

""She did tell me she was having some problems in her relationship, because I would always ask her how Gordon was."" 

82Georgio said that Ms Byrne had said to him that the applicant was ""a bit possessive and a bit of jealousy there."" He also indicated that ""she was worried about his temper, he gets angry a lot, she was saying. He wasn't the Gordon she knew."" 

83Georgio gave evidence of a conversation with Ms Byrne that took place in April or May 1995: 

""She was talking about jealousy again and how he's very possessive and I think she had sort of made up her mind that - well to my impression - that she was , the way she was saying it to me, that she was thinking about leaving him again...In that conversation I remember distinctly and again I took it as just a relationship problem, she said 'sometimes I fear for my life'. She said it like that."" 

84In summary, it was the Crown case that by about March 1995 the relationship between the applicant and Ms Byrne was fracturing. The Crown submitted that Ms Byrne was tiring of the applicant's possessiveness and was concerned about his false promises of large bonuses and financial success from his connection with Rivkin. The Crown also asserted that she was concerned about the rumours surrounding the nature of Rivkin's relationship with various of his male associates including rumours that the applicant was in a homosexual relationship with Rivkin. 

Evidence of a happy relationship 

85Although there was evidence that Ms Byrne may not have been happy in the relationship there was other evidence, which gave the opposite impression. The applicant returned from overseas on 27 May 1995. On that day Ms Byrne called her father who gave evidence that she said to him how wonderful it was that Gordon had come home that Saturday morning. She said, ""it is wonderful. He's home. It's good to have him back home."" 

86Miss June Dally-Watkins also saw Ms Byrne on that day. She said that although Ms Byrne had a cold she was ""very excited because Gordon had returned, I think that very morning from overseas and she was very happy and very excited ..."" Other witnesses reported Ms Byrne's happiness that the applicant was coming home. 

87Peter Byrne said that he met with Ms Byrne for coffee before he went overseas in May 1995. He said, ""She was her normal self. She seemed quite happy and relaxed...She [also] mentioned to me that Gordon was pressuring her to marry him. That when I questioned her about that, if that was any concern, she shrugged it off."" 

88Mrs Natalie Butler (nee McCamley) considered herself to be Ms Byrne's best friend. She described her observations about the relationship between Ms Byrne and the applicant: 

""Caroline was very much - she was very happy. She seemed - you know, as a couple, they were very happy together; they seemed to be enjoying life. They did a lot. She didn't like it when Gordon went away for long periods of time. And before, just before her death, Gordon had been away for a while and she was getting frustrated because he was changing the day he was coming back...Generally they seemed very happy together and I never really saw them any other way. It was always quite normal and happy."" 

89Watson said that her impression was ""that he [Gordon] would often call Caroline on her mobile. So I knew that - or I assumed - that they were very very close."" She said she thought they had a good relationship: ""Caroline didn't divulge too much information to me at the time about her relationship but it seemed to be okay."" 

90The applicant's sister, Ms Michelle Wood, confirmed her statement dated 7 August 2001. In that statement she had said of Ms Byrne and the applicant's long-term plans: 

""They both communicated to me that they were getting married and having kids. They wanted children before Gordon was 35. My brother told me that she was the one and he was absolutely sure that she was the one."" 

91Ms Wood also said, ""I got the impression that she [Ms Byrne] was very much in love with Gordon as well."" 

Problems in Ms Byrne ' s career 

92Ms Byrne was an attractive and elegant woman who had ambition to be a successful fashion model. She was aged 24 at the time of her death. She had been working as a model through the Gordon Charles Management Modelling agency. She enjoyed the work but by the time of her death she was having difficulty defining her future career path. 

93Approximately 3 weeks prior to her death, Ms Byrne received an offer of full-time employment from the June Dally-Watkins agency. She had previously worked part time for June Dally-Watkins as a teacher. The offer was to work in marketing for the agency. She was troubled as to whether if she accepted the offer it would have an adverse impact upon her modelling career. She discussed these issues with Mr Gordon Donald of the Gordon Charles Modelling Agency, who was her agent seeking his views on what course she should take. Donald advised her that working with June Dally-Watkins would adversely impact on her modelling but that Miss Watkins might allow her to continue to perform some modelling work. She decided to accept the full-time job. After she had started with June Dally-Watkins, Donald said they had a conversation in which Ms Byrne said that the job was ""more difficult than she had anticipated."" 

94Ms Byrne commenced full-time employment with June Dally-Watkins on 29 May 1995. On Wednesday, 31 May she spoke with her father and told him ""I miss the modelling. I miss the modelling very much ... I do like modelling."" Mr Byrne said that he told his daughter that if she was going to be working full-time at June Dally-Watkins, ""you have got to give up the modelling."" This was the conversation that was terminated when his daughter said that the applicant had called her and she said he was in a ""shitty mood."" 

95Mr Byrne said that on Friday, 2 June his daughter had told him that she had spoken to Donald about her modelling and he had told her that ""she would never be a top model, but that she still had several years of ... work."" Her father described her mood on this occasion as ""very, very happy. Very overjoyed at being told that she would never be a top model but that he ... would be able to give her work for the years ahead."" She told her father that following this conversation she intended to cease working full-time for June Dally-Watkins but would work part-time with that enterprise and continue with her modelling. 

96On that Friday Ms Byrne had been working with Mr Hany Mohamed at premises on the northern beaches for June Dally-Watkins. Mr Mohamed gave evidence that he had given her a lift back to the city and that on the way home she had called the applicant. He said that ""it seemed to be a happy conversation."" 

97Watson saw her outside the June Dally-Watkins agency on the Friday afternoon. She said that Ms Byrne had the flu and although in the past she had been an optimistic, vivacious and happy person, on that day ""she seemed quite flat and fluey."" Watson said that she asked Ms Byrne if everything was okay and she responded that ""she was just run down with the flu and stressed with work; that she couldn't get to the gym so she was feeling a bit down."" Watson gave evidence that Ms Byrne ""was really drained from work and seemed flat. She told me she had a promotion at work and that she didn't realise how hard it would be."" 

98Watson and Ms Byrne caught a train together to Kings Cross and then went to a café near Ms Byrne's apartment. She said that Ms Byrne was ""very vague and she seemed to be distracted ... for some reason she was, I would say, not very engaging on that day."" She said that Ms Byrne repeated that she had the flu and that she ""felt like shit."" Watson was sufficiently concerned about Ms Byrne's health to phone her at home that night. Although Ms Byrne said she was all right Watson said ""I wasn't convinced."" The available inference is that Ms Byrne was physically unwell and down about her work situation, an inference which is supported by the events which occurred early in the following week. 

99On Saturday, 3 June 1995 Ms Byrne spoke to a friend, Ms Narelle Cook. Cook gave evidence that Ms Byrne ""was worrying a little bit about giving up some of her modelling and working full-time. She was also worrying about asking for a raise or asking for money ... She really enjoyed the modelling and was just a bit apprehensive about having to maybe give some of that up, but was going to see if she could keep doing it."" 

100On the same day Ms Byrne spoke to her sister Deanne in Japan who gave evidence that ""everything seemed fine. She sounded tired and I think she had a cold. I could tell this from the tone of her voice."" Ms Lisa Fraser, a part-time receptionist at the June Dally-Watkins agency, gave evidence that at the time Ms Byrne had a cold which she ""was a little bit upset about."" 

101Butler, a close friend of Ms Byrne, said that Ms Byrne was ""sick and I thought, oh obviously, she hasn't been real well ... and she was just a bit tired and someone with a cold really."" She also said that Ms Byrne was ""a little bit nervous about going to the Parklea markets the next week."" However, she said that despite being nervous Ms Byrne was looking forward to the work with June Dally-Watkins ""even though it would be long days and quite hard work."" 

102Ms Byrne went to work on Sunday, 4 June. She apparently attended Narrabeen High School for a promotional event for June Dally-Watkins. 

103Mr Adam Leigh was Ms Byrne's booking agent at the Gordon Charles model agency. He said that 2 days before she died Ms Byrne had been to see him to ask his opinion as to whether she should continue modelling or accept a full-time position at June Dally-Watkins. He advised her that the job with June Dally-Watkins would be more stable but she should still be able to do some modelling part-time. He said that he was ""basically saying to her that she wasn't one of the top few models so if she was looking for that, if she was looking for a work load of one of the top few models I said to her that it probably wouldn't be there"" and that her work would be ""nothing compared to the leading models."" 

104Leigh said that she appeared to take the news ""okay."" He said that after he found out that Ms Byrne had died he felt guilty and at the memorial service was upset, saying ""I was actually feeling really guilty about saying these things to her."" 

The issue of depression 

105The prosecution led evidence from several witnesses who testified to their observations in relation to Ms Byrne's mental state shortly before her death. Among them was Ms Michelle Whelan, who in early 1995 was a 14- or 15-year-old student of Ms Byrne's at the June Dally-Watkins School. 

106Whelan and the deceased came to be friends. Whelan recalled that at Ms Byrne's invitation, she accompanied Ms Byrne on a trip to the Gap in January 1995. Whelan said that they discussed general topics on this quick visit. Whelan recalled asking Ms Byrne how she knew about the Gap, and that Ms Byrne told her ""it was one of her and Gordon's favourite places to go alongside with Camp Cove and other places like that around the bay."" Whelan said she then asked Ms Byrne ""what he [the applicant] was like, but she didn't want to answer me. She just stopped talking and she stopped looking at me and turned towards the ocean and was just looking out."" 

107Whelan says that shortly after this visit, in about January or February 1995, she called Ms Byrne and they arranged another trip to the Gap. Whelan's evidence was that she had recently written Ms Byrne a note in which Whelan confessed she did not feel worthy of a place in the Dally-Watkins course, to which Ms Byrne responded that Whelan did deserve the opportunity. 

108Whelan said that on the second visit to the Gap, she stood at the cliff fence and, looking down into the ocean, said words to the effect of ""I wish I was dead sometimes."" Whelan recalled that Ms Byrne asked her to come sit next to her, which she did. Whelan's evidence was that Ms Byrne then said: ""If you are thinking what I think you're thinking, it's not the answer."" Whelan said that Ms Byrne went on to explain that although she too sometimes felt depressed, ""there's always someone you can talk to."" Whelan recalled that Ms Byrne told her that ""she loved her father [Tony Byrne] very much"" and ""wouldn't do that [commit suicide] to her family."" Whelan agreed that Ms Byrne's words had cheered her up. 

109On Monday, 5 June 1995 Ms Byrne consulted a general practitioner, Dr Cindy Pan. Dr Pan gave the following evidence in chief about the consultation: 

""She had been feeling depressed for about a month. She had been feeling a bit low for about a month and depressed for the last week and she had recently started a new job in sales for June Dally Watkins, and her boyfriend had been away recently for about 3 weeks for work, and he was now back. And she couldn't put her finger on what she thought was making her feel down. She had felt depressed about 3 years previously, and she had counselling and medication and it had helped and she got better. And she said nothing specific had happened to set her off feeling depressed, and I asked her specifically, if she had any thoughts of harming herself, not because I thought she would, but more because that's a routine question that you ask a person who is feeling depressed and she said definitely not. And because she said she had been depressed in the past, and that seeing a psychiatrist and taking anti-depressants helped, I referred her to - she couldn't remember the name of the previous psychiatrist, though I referred her to a psychiatrist that I knew and I rang to get her an appointment. And they actually offered an appointment for the following day, but she declined that appointment because she had a work commitment for June Dally Watkins ... and she was very adamant that she wanted to attend this work commitment and - because I said 'well I could write you a medical certificate'. Mainly because sometimes it's hard to get appointments, and because this appointment was available I thought it would be good if she could take it. But as it was, they then offered her an appointment for the day after that, so Wednesday."" 

110Dr Pan was of course giving evidence many years after the consultation. It would be expected that a doctor, who would see many patients in a year, would have little independent recall of an individual consultation. She referred to her notes when giving evidence and her letter of referral to the psychiatrist was tendered. The letter was in the following terms: 

""Dr Cindy Pan 5/6/95 

Dear Dr Sippe, 

Many thanks for seeing 24 y Caroline Byrne who is feeling very very depressed recently for ~1/12 but much worse for the past 1/52. She cannot understand why because nothing has actually happened to act it ...... that she can think of. She had the same thing ....3 yrs ago and saw a psychiatrist (? Who) and had medication which helped her out of it. 

She has just started a new job doing sales for June Dally Watkins and one's not sure how she feels about it. 

She feels she can't do anything, can't sleep, can't express herself. No thoughts of self harm. 

Many thanks for your review and management. 

Yours sincerely."" 

111When the doctor was cross-examined she clarified her notes saying that they included the following comments: 

""Almost can't go to work. Just started a new job."" 

112She also accepted that her notes included the following: 

""Feels very depressed. Very severe in the past week. Just started new job ... sales for June Dally Watkins. Not sure what she would like to do. 

Can't express herself. Feels good for nothing... "" 

113After Ms Byrne died Dr Pan wrote a note to the police on 8 June in which she observed, inter alia: 

""Dear sir, I am Cindy Pan and I have been in general practice for three years. I had been seeing Caroline Byrne for about two years on and off. Her most recent visit was the 5 th of June 1995 when she described herself as feeling very depressed. We talked for a long time and she said she could not put her finger on just what she was unhappy about, but she had felt depressed for about one month, but more so in the past one week. She had recently started a new job in sales at Dally-Watkins, where she has worked for three years in a different position. She could not say whether she liked it or not. She felt as if she could not express herself or say what she wanted to do. She denied firmly any thought of self-harm, I encouraged her to see a psychiatrist, and she agreed to go. I rang the psychiatrist Dr Sippe's rooms and made her an appointment. They said they could not take her that same day, but gave her a time for the following day, Tuesday, 6 June 1995. She could not take it, she said, because of a work commitment. I encouraged her to take that time off work and go to Dr Sippe, saying she could easily have a medical certificate. She insisted that no-one else could replace her so I made her an appointment for Wednesday, 7 June at 4.30 pm. She accepted this and was keen to go."" 

114When she gave evidence Dr Pan said that she did not believe that Ms Byrne was suicidal when she saw her but agreed that some people who commit suicide do not display any symptoms at all. She said that Ms Byrne had not told her that when she had felt depressed 3 years previously she had attempted to commit suicide by a drug overdose. Ms Byrne did not tell Dr Pan that her mother had committed suicide. Dr Pan gave evidence that ""when people are suicidal, there are usually some antecedents."" 

115Dr Pan said she had asked Ms Byrne if she was feeling down about her work but she said, ""it wasn't really that, no."" The two changes that Dr Pan identified in Ms Byrne's life which may have altered her disposition were that the applicant had returned from overseas and the change in her work situation. However, Dr Pan said that she ""didn't specifically say that either of those things were what was making her depressed."" 

116On 5 June Ms Byrne took a phone call at 12.30 pm, scheduling a modelling booking for 4 pm the following day. The booking was later rescheduled to 5.15 pm. She also had lunch with friends, Ms Tanya Zaetta and Ms Tali Blumenfeld. Zaetta gave evidence that ""Ms Byrne was a little bit confused about work."" Zaetta also said that Ms Byrne told her that ""Gordy and I are having a moment."" Zaetta said that she took this to mean a ""little tiff"" in their relationship. Blumenfeld said she did not pay much attention to this discussion as ""all couples argue. So I didn't think anything of it."" 

117Zaetta also said ""I know that Caroline had a lot on her mind, for example there was the whole June Dally-Watkins thing of whether Caroline should take the job at June Dally-Watkins or not."" She said that Ms Byrne did not appear depressed and did not tell her about the appointment with Dr Pan. 

118Ms Byrne rang her father at 3 pm on Monday, 5 June. When he gave evidence he said that his daughter had told him that she and the applicant had a quiet weekend and she felt much better. He said she sounded happy and excited that she would still be modelling. 

119This evidence is at odds with a statement which Mr Byrne made on 3 January 1996, in which he said that Ms Byrne told him during this telephone call that she was feeling very down about work and was anxious about talking to Ms Carel Clifford at June Dally-Watkins: 

""I last spoke to Caroline on Monday, June 5. It was the day her brother Peter arrived home from an 8-week trip to Japan, not China. We spoke on three separate occasions. She had been to the doctors. Her last call to me was about 3 pm. She said she was going to an assignment to PLC Pymble that evening and tomorrow she was going to Parklea. She said she was going to take my advice and when she saw Carol [sic] Clifford from June Dally-Watkins, during the week, she was going to tell her she wanted to keep up your modelling career with Gordon Charles and go back to casual with June Dally-Watkins. She was feeling down about this decision and I felt she was suffering from a mild case of anxiety. She had an appointment on Wednesday afternoon with a counsellor which she did not keep..."" 

120According to his evidence at trial, Ms Byrne did not mention visiting Dr Pan or the appointment with Dr Sippe. 

121In his police interview on 14 June 1996, the applicant described a conversation with Ms Byrne at around 7 pm on the Monday: 

""She rang me and asked where I was and I said 'Ill [sic] be home in a minute.' I thought she rang from home. I said, I'll be home in a minute. I'm just walking through Kings Cross, and she said, Well, I'm not at home yet; I'm visiting a friend in Bellevue Hill and she said, But I'll leave now and I'll see you at home soon."" 

122The applicant explained that he knew Ms Byrne was not visiting a friend in Bellevue Hill for two reasons: ""because I know she didn't have a friend in Bellevue Hill and secondly she never would have said to me I'm visiting a friend in Bellevue Hill; she'd say, I'm at so-and-so's."" 

123The applicant said that when Ms Byrne returned home that evening ""she didn't look her normal self but I put it down to the fact that she was unhappy with her work and that she'd had the flu and what have you"". In the subsequent conversation Ms Byrne apparently acknowledged that she was not with a friend in Bellevue Hill and explained to the applicant that she had been to the doctor and ""the doctor had said she was depressed."" 

124The applicant said that he and Ms Byrne had a conversation in which Ms Byrne indicated that she was really unhappy with what she was doing at work and she said ""I think I've taken on something that I don't like and I don't think I can get out of it."" The applicant said that he tried to comfort her and tried to encourage her to speak to her father but she declined. 

Tuesday, 6 June 

125On Tuesday, 6 June 1995 both the applicant and Rivkin were interviewed by the ASC (later known as ASIC) in relation to the affairs of the Offset Alpine Printing Group between 1 December 1994 and 28 February 1995. No charge resulted from the inquiry. 

126Mr Jamie Fawcett, a journalist, said that the applicant told him that the inquiry was difficult for Ms Byrne ""because he couldn't tell her or explain to her what was going on."" 

127During Tuesday, 6 June Ms Byrne twice rang the modelling agency. It seems that she withdrew from the job which had been scheduled for that day at 5.15 pm. The job was allocated to another model. 

128Ms Byrne worked on the Tuesday at Parklea markets and was seen to leave there at about 2.15 or 2.30 pm. She made a purchase from BP Rose Bay at 3.39 pm that afternoon. 

129That evening at 5.47 pm and again at 6.08 pm the applicant called his doctor, Dr Joseph Grech. He asked the doctor whether he could have a medical certificate to explain Ms Byrne's prospective absence from work. Not surprisingly the doctor would not give him the certificate. The doctor said that his best memory was that the applicant had said he wanted to take Ms Byrne to the Blue Mountains as he had not been able to spend much time with her lately. 

130When the applicant was interviewed in 1996 he said that after returning home from work on Tuesday night, he and Ms Byrne continued the conversation from the previous evening about Ms Byrne ""wanting to go sick for a period of time."" The applicant described her as ""like a very different person"" and ""she was very off about the whole thing"". Ms Byrne said, ""I wanna go sick. You know, I cant [sic], I cant [sic] quit; I'm gonna have to fake an illness or something."" The applicant said he responded, ""Well you know, you've got to come up with something really good but if you come up with an illness, like glandular fever...you cant go to the gym, you cant go out and see people. You're gonna have to lie low so that the word doesn't get out that Caroline Byrne's having a great time when you're trying to get off work."" He said, ""She asked me to ask my doctor, who is a friend, for a sick note to get her off work and I said, well, I would do that."" He also indicated that ""she wouldn't speak to...Carel Clifford - because she was kind of scared of Carel and she didn't like Carel very much. So I said, well, look, I'll ring up Carel and say you're really sick and I'll say I've picked you up from the doctors and you're sick and you cant come in for a while."" 

131The prosecution criticised the actions of the applicant. It was submitted that the applicant was attempting to provide an excuse so that he could take Ms Byrne away. It was submitted that their relationship was unravelling and that the applicant believed he needed to spend time with Ms Byrne alone to endeavour to retrieve it. 

132I have a different view. Contrary to the Crown's submission, the applicant's actions in relation to Ms Byrne at this point are at least equally consistent with those of a caring partner concerned that Ms Byrne was not coping with her new role with June Dally-Watkins. Although he was perhaps naïve, I believe it was just as likely that he was endeavouring to ensure that her employer did not learn of the reason for her difficulties and the fact that she was suffering from depression. Although his action in contacting his own doctor led to an inevitable rejection of his request, it is untenable that the only conclusion to be drawn was that the applicant was seeking to secrete Ms Byrne to serve his own ends rather than provide her with some time to restore her health. 

133The applicant called his home at 7 pm that evening. At 7.26 pm Ms Byrne used her mobile phone to try to call home. She then tried to call the applicant's mobile phone. The records show that the calls were sourced through a mobile phone tower described as ""North Shore."" There was evidence at the trial that mobile phone calls made at Watsons Bay and the Gap could be recorded as calls from ""the North Shore."" However, I do not believe this evidence is sufficient to enable any conclusion to be drawn as to the location from which the call was made. 

134At the trial the defence sought to make use of this evidence to support an inference that Ms Byrne may have been at the Gap on the Tuesday evening of 6 June, but was not then in the company of the applicant. Although she may not have been with the applicant I do not believe her whereabouts can be established. Although it is possible that she was at the Gap there are many other locations from which her phone may have registered as making contact with ""North Shore."" 

135Ms Byrne called her home again at 7.49 pm. On this occasion the call was recorded as coming from ""Sydney City."" This was the last call Ms Byrne made from her mobile telephone. 

136Between 8.30 and 8.50 pm that night the applicant rang Clifford (at the Dally-Watkins office). He left a message on the answering machine in the following terms: 

""Carel, it's Gordon Wood, Caroline's boyfriend, ahmm, I'm not sure what the time is, I've just got a phone call from her doctor. She's been over there since she finished work and apparently she's undergoing some tests. She's pretty sick. Apparently she hasn't got over this thing and the doctors all they've told me so far is that she won't be working for a while which is a problem for you guys ahmm so because she's got all the stuff out at wherever this career show is so ahmm if you want to give me a call at home tonight until about 9.30 on 368 1010, failing that I'll give you a call at work tomorrow to let you know exactly what the status is but ahmm its not good at the moment so ahmm but I'm told not to worry so don't worry and I'll let you know more as I know more okay, so I'm sorry about that, Bye."" 

137Within a short period of time Clifford rang the applicant back and he told her that Ms Byrne would not be returning to work. She said the impression she received was that Ms Byrne was not coming back at all. However, Clifford made notes of the conversation and I am satisfied that they are likely to give a more accurate impression of the exchange. In those notes she said that Ms Byrne would be off sick for two days: ""sick 7 and 8/6 flu last week. In bed on weekend. Doctor tonight and tomorrow evening. Tests and a specialist. 8.30 picked her up from doctor ??????."" Clifford said that during the phone call the applicant appeared concerned for Ms Byrne's wellbeing. 

138The applicant said that after making those phone calls, ""Caroline seemed relieved that I had made the phone call."" He suggested to Ms Byrne that they go away for a short break to the Blue Mountains to get away and discuss what she really wanted to do. He described the arrangement when the two of them went to bed on Tuesday night as being that Ms Byrne would ""keep her phone off with the machine on, turn your mobile off so don't take any calls and if I call you then you can edit the calls and pick it up, so Carel can't ring you and I'll speak to her."" 

139Telephone records indicate that no calls were made on Ms Byrne's mobile phone on 7 June 1995. No voice mail diversions were recorded on her phone. 

140The applicant was interviewed by Insp Wyver on 14 June 1996. He told Inspector Wyver that on the Tuesday evening of 7 June Ms Byrne was ""very clingy and hugging me a lot ... ."" He said they had agreed that she would stay home and rest the next day and keep her mobile phone off and the answering machine on so that phone calls could be screened. In a later interview with Det Sgt Jubelin on 23 July 2001 the applicant said that he and Ms Byrne were up until late on the Tuesday night talking about her situation. 

141The Crown asked the jury to infer an ulterior motive in the applicant in relation to the turning off of Ms Byrne's mobile. The suggestion was that he wished to isolate her from her family and friends. There is nothing in the evidence to support this speculative assumption. It would be equally possible, and I believe more likely, that Ms Byrne turned it off because in her depressed mood she did not wish to have contact with other people. 

142After her death, the applicant asserted that Ms Byrne had told him that she was at the Gap on the Tuesday night. He told her brother that Ms Byrne had been late home that night and when she arrived home she said she had been out at the Gap thinking about things. As I have indicated, the telephone record is not inconsistent with Ms Byrne having been at the Gap. 

143On 10 June 1995 the applicant apparently told Ms Cook, Ms Byrne's childhood friend, that he did not know where Ms Byrne was on the Tuesday evening. On the same day he told Mr Peter Cameron that Ms Byrne had been at the Gap two nights before she died. He apparently told Dally-Watkins on the weekend after Ms Byrne's death that she had gone missing for 5 hours on Tuesday night and he thought she was at the Gap contemplating jumping at that time. 

144The Crown emphasised that no mention of these matters was made in any statements or interviews with the police. In an interview in July 2001 the applicant asserted that the police officer that conducted his 1996 interview, Insp Wyver, had told him that Ms Byrne had called his (the applicant's) cell phone from the Gap and that ""that would be my only knowledge of her having been at the Gap."" When asked if he had any evidence that suggested that she was at the Gap during the day leading up to her death he said that ""I have no reason to believe that she was there other than the police told me she was."" 

Wednesday afternoon - the evidence of Martin and Melbourne 

145The movements of Ms Byrne on the Wednesday are difficult to establish with any confidence. Two people, Mr Lance Melbourne and Mr Craig Martin, operators of the Bad Dog Cafe in Watsons Bay, alleged that they saw her, or someone who looked like her, with two men in the Park near the Gap known as Robertson Park. It was the prosecution case that Martin and Melbourne had seen Ms Byrne and the applicant with another person at approximately 1 pm and that Melbourne saw them again at approximately 3 pm in the Park. However, Martin and Melbourne could not say with any certainty what day it was that they saw the three people in the Park. The evidence from Martin was that on either a Tuesday or Wednesday in June 1995, between 11 am and1 pm, he saw three people. He said that the woman was stunning. The evidence was that the persons who were seen were happy. There was no suggestion of any animosity between them at that time. 

146I have discussed the problems with this evidence in relation to Ground 2. A summary of relevant matters is all that is presently required. 

147There are other difficulties with the evidence of Melbourne and Martin. They were first asked to identify the applicant and Ms Byrne from photographs which they were shown by Miss Dally-Watkins some days after Ms Byrne died. It has long been accepted that people have difficulty in identifying a person they may have seen in a collection of photographs which they are later shown. However, when the witness is shown only one photograph the opportunity for misidentification is significantly enhanced. I am not satisfied that the evidence is capable of establishing that Ms Byrne or the applicant were present in Robertson Park in the afternoon. The evidence was that the persons who were seen were happy. There was no suggestion of any animosity between them at that time. 

148The evidence indicates that at 3.32 pm Ms Byrne's debit card was used to purchase petrol and chocolate at a Caltex outlet in Paddington and her debit card was used to withdraw $50 from a bank in Vaucluse. These latter transactions took place at 3.47 pm. There is nothing to suggest that Ms Byrne did not make these purchases. Vaucluse is closer to the Gap than Paddington with the consequence that her movements are consistent with her driving from her home through Paddington and then to Vaucluse before going to the Gap. This evidence does not sit comfortably, although it is not necessarily inconsistent with, the suggestion that she was in Robertson Park. Nor is it inconsistent with the applicant's version of the events. 

149The Gap and its surrounds are visited by many people every day. Many of those persons will be well-dressed, younger people enjoying the surroundings including the park. It would be likely that persons of similar general appearance to the applicant and Ms Byrne would be present from time to time. 

150Martin said that it was about a week after he saw the three people that Dally-Watkins approached him with photographs of Ms Byrne and the applicant. He said that he also saw a white Vitara motor car (Ms Byrne and the applicant owned such a car) there at 8-9 pm the night after he had seen the people there during the day, and saw the car again the next day. He did not notice any police around the next day. He said that he saw a green Bentley the same day he saw the people, he thinks after he saw them. He described this car in detail. Although there was a suggestion that the Bentley was one owned by Rivkin I am satisfied that this was not his car. 

151Melbourne said that they saw the three people one to two weeks before Dally-Watkins came to the cafe. He saw them around the middle of the week at around 1 pm. He said that he saw a Vitara the same day in the afternoon at about 4-5 pm, at 11 pm that night and the next morning at 8 am. He also described seeing a two-door Bentley that day. He did not know the exact date. He did not see any police or Rescue Squad or police ropings the next day. He said he was not sure of the date of these events. 

152Ms Sandra Munro, Melbourne's partner, recalled seeing a Suzuki Vitara vehicle one day outside the Bad Dog Cafe three times, in an afternoon about lunch time, that night and the next morning. She said that the occasion was a few days before Dally-Watkins came to the cafe to ask about the events of 7 June. (Dally-Watkins first went to the cafe on 10 June). Munro said she saw a wallet or some keys in the Vitara the next morning. She said that she also saw a green Bentley a few days before or a few days after she saw the Vitara but before Dally-Watkins came into the cafe. 

153As I have indicated, there are significant issues in relation to the reliability of the evidence of Martin and Melbourne. I have discussed them in detail in relation to Ground 2. However, they include a mistaken positive identification of Leigh as one of the two men in the Park that afternoon. The Crown accepts that Leigh was not there. The Bentley was most likely owned by Mr John Singleton. Apart from these difficulties, the manner in which they were first asked to identify Ms Byrne and the applicant from photographs causes me to doubt the reliability of their evidence. There evidence does not justify a finding that either the applicant or Ms Byrne were at the Park that afternoon. 

Wednesday evening - the evidence of Doherty 

154Doherty lived in an apartment above shop premises on Military Road in Watsons Bay, a short distance from the Gap. His studio overlooked Military Road. I have discussed his evidence in greater detail in relation to Ground 2. In 1998 Doherty came forward with evidence that he had heard a helicopter some time after midnight, around 1.30 to 2 am on 8 June 1995. He said that earlier in the evening, before 8 pm, ""I heard a young girl outside who was sort of slurring her words and moaning."" He described the scene in the following terms: 

""I saw the young girl with her head in her hands sitting on the kerb at the bottom of the light post on the far side of the road from my studio. She was moaning and slurring her words and in conversation with another person, who was standing underneath the awning of the building I was in. I couldn't see him. I could hear the voice but I couldn't see the person. And there was another smaller man - another man sitting on the wall just up from where the girl was sitting. And he wasn't - he was just sitting. And occasionally he would get up and walk in and out of the shadows between where he was sitting and the pizza bar, that's the pizza bar in Watson's Bay. That was my initial look and I thought they were having an argument and they were coming from the pub. On many occasions there's arguments and sort of merry drunk arguments between people on the way home."" 

155As they continued arguing, Doherty said he ""looked out once more and the three people were together on the far side of the road ... the girl was in the middle of the two men and they were walking north towards the Gap park ... they just became shadows as they walked up the road."" 

156Doherty was of the view that the woman was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He also said, ""she was not carrying on normally. She was being combative. She wasn't making any sense and she was moaning and slurring her words."" 

157Doherty gave a description of the man who was initially under the awning as ""a tall man probably around 6 feet tall. He had dark clothes on. I thought it was a leather jacket, a dark leather jacket, probably black and it was like a three-quarter length down to, you know, the thigh below the bottom and he had short cropped blonde hair."" The other man was ""dressed in dark clothes ... he was small ... about 5 foot 6 inches and I thought he had something on his head like a beanie."" The girl had ""dark clothes on ... and I have a feeling that she had denim on. I don't know whether it was a denim jacket or denim jeans or something."" Doherty did not see the face of the girl and could not describe her hair. He said he could not tell whether she had long hair ""because she had her hands on her head."" 

158At about ""10.30ish... for about an hour"" Doherty described hearing another argument ""coming from near the pathway where the Simon University meets the Gap lookout and I recognised the argument as a continuation of the argument I'd heard below me, even though it was further away."" He was unable to make out any words of the argument but he did say, ""there seemed to be a girl's voice and two men's voices."" 

159Doherty said that ""about 11.30 or 12 I heard a [female] scream, a short scream and that was it."" The following day, on 8 June 1995, Doherty spoke with his neighbour Ms Fairlie Kingston and told her that he had heard a scream the previous evening in the context of ""somebody going off the Gap."" 

160Doherty had been travelling extensively between June 1995 and early 1998. Upon his return in 1998 Kingston showed Doherty a newspaper article which contained photographs of the applicant and Ms Byrne. Ten days later he again spoke to Kingston and told her of his full recollection of 7 June 1995. 

161A short time after his discussion with Kingston, the ""Witness"" television program was broadcast. Doherty viewed the program. He said that it was the first opportunity he had had to have a closer look at what the applicant looked like. In his evidence at trial Doherty described the taller man that he had seen under the awning as having a ""similar stature,"" ""looks similar,"" ""he was the same slim build,"" ""hair was similar,"" and a similar head shape to the applicant. He made a statement to the police in April 1998. 

162The evidence from Ms Byrne's family and friends as to Ms Byrne's usual demeanour was entirely at odds with her being ""drunk"" or ""stoned"" and sitting in the gutter arguing and shouting at people. Her sister Deanna said that she had never seen Ms Byrne drunk and her friend Zaetta said that the description given by Doherty would be ""absolutely absurd"" if applied to Ms Byrne. 

163Doherty's description of the taller man, which the Crown submitted was likely to be the applicant, was not consistent with his appearance at the time. Photographs of the applicant taken in 10 June 1995 by Dally-Watkins and Mr Brett Cochrane (also known as Basquali) do not show him to have very short hair. Mr Byrne also gave evidence that at the time the applicant ""certainly did not have short back and sides."" 

164Doherty described the person he saw as having ""short cropped blonde hair"" and that his hair was ""very, very short."" He was emphatic that the man he saw did not have long blonde hair. He said that you could ""see the shape of the head very clearly."" 

165This raises one of the common issues in relation to identification evidence. I deal with it comprehensively under Ground 2. When the applicant appeared on the ""Witness"" program he did have short hair. There is every chance that Doherty's memory has been influenced by the images he saw of the applicant well after 1995. 

166At Watsons Bay there is a licensed hotel and a tavern. It would not be unusual to find people in the streets in the evening, some of whom may be influenced by alcohol, and no doubt from time to time people had arguments. 

167The Crown case relied on Doherty's evidence. The jury were directed that his evidence did not purport to identify the applicant or the deceased. They were also directed that they could not conclude on the evidence that Redding, an acquaintance of the applicant, was the second man. They were directed that ""at best the evidence is of people, including two persons whose appearance was consistent with their being the accused and the deceased."" 

168Doherty's evidence of hearing the same persons arguing later that night around Simon University just before a scream, was contrary to the evidence of Mr Norman Wano and Mr Domenico Brunetta (the fishermen who were present at the time). They said that the scream they heard was isolated. Neither Martin nor Melbourne gave evidence of hearing an argument that night, although Martin said that he saw the Vitara at about the same time as the argument is said to have occurred. 

169Even if one accepted that the woman that Doherty saw was the deceased, that did not prove or necessarily support an inference that the applicant was with her. The jury were earlier told by the trial judge that the Crown would submit ""that if the deceased were there, then the accused her partner, was more likely to be there as well. So you can use the evidence in that way as well."" This reasoning was dangerous and the jury should have been warned against it, particularly in a trial where this was a central and contested issue. 

170I am not persuaded that Doherty's evidence establishes that he saw either Ms Byrne or the applicant that evening. 

The fishermen 

171Wano and Brunetta went fishing at the Gap on the night of 7 June 1995. Wano gave evidence that he heard a female scream which went for ""a couple of seconds I reckon"" after 10.30 pm. He described it as a scared scream which he said was ""very loud at first and then it got fainter towards the end."" He said the scream emanated from a point approximately 100 m to the left of the flat rock near the Dunbar anchor. 

172Brunetta also said that he heard a woman scream which lasted ""a couple of seconds."" He said it was like someone who was ""[in] panic, scared, I don't know something like that."" He said it was one voice and loud and was a continuous scream. He said it was like a female who was panicking as if she was in trouble. He said that after the scream the whole area went ""dead silent."" Brunetta could not pinpoint where the scream came from, indicating that it could have come from any part of the northern section of the Gap. 

173Wano said that the evening was ""pretty-very dark"" and that you could not really see things at the bottom of the rocks when it was dark. He also said that it was windy. 

174Brunetta also said that the night was dark and quiet. He said that apart from the scream he heard no other voices around the area of the Gap. 

175Approximately 1 hour after he heard the scream Brunetta said he saw the applicant calling ""Caroline, Caroline"" from a position close to the Dunbar anchor. The applicant saw him and asked whether he had seen a blonde girl. Brunetta indicated that he had seen no-one but did not mention the scream that he had heard. He said that when the applicant came back sometime later with two other men he told them about the scream. He said that at that point the applicant asked to borrow his torch and used it to look over the edge. When the applicant came back he asked him whether he had found his friend and the man replied ""no."" Ms Byrne's body was later found in a position, which was consistent with the point on the top of the cliff from where Brunetta reported the scream to have come. 

176Wano saw the applicant shining the torch towards the water but in his opinion its beam was not strong enough to see to the bottom of the cliff. He said Ms Byrne's body was later found in the area where the torch was shining although he did say that the beam of light was ""going everywhere, like when you are searching for something."" 

The applicant ' s movements on the Wednesday 

177The applicant gave several accounts of his movements on Wednesday, 7 June 1995: in his statement dated 12 June 1995; in an interview with the police on 14 June 1996; on the ""Witness"" program on 12 April 1998; and in his interview with the police in London on 23 July 2001. These accounts are largely consistent. 

178When interviewed on 14 June 1996, the applicant said, ""normally of a morning Caroline was an early riser like me; she'd get up really early and we'd go and exercise and what have you. But she hadn't been doing that obviously while she'd been sick and while she was depressed and she stayed in bed in the mornings. She found it really hard to get up, which is unlike her."" He explained that all week ""she had real trouble getting up, getting to work."" 

179He said that on the Wednesday he got ready for work, kissed Ms Byrne goodbye and said to her ""'I'll see you at lunchtime' and she sort of nodded."" 

180The applicant said that he came home between 12.45 and 1 pm after dropping Rivkin off to his lunch engagement at Alife restaurant. It was the applicant's recollection that Rivkin had lunched with Richardson that day. 

181The applicant said when he arrived home ""I went in to get her and she was still in bed"" . He said that he went to wake Ms Byrne and she stirred and smiled. He asked her if she wanted to get up and come and have lunch and she ""said no or she shook her head."" When asked if she wanted to stay in bed, she nodded. He said he felt that ""this was not normal Caroline behaviour."" He said that he entered the bathroom and opened the cupboard to find ""3 or 4 Rohypnol sleeping tablets in a little cut-off piece of silver foil."" He said that the tablets were left over from his recent trip with Rivkin. The applicant said that he returned to the bedroom and asked Ms Byrne if she had taken the Rohypnol. She said, ""Yes, I've had some for the last few nights 'cause I haven't been able to sleep."" 

182As it happens the autopsy report does show ""past ingestion of Rohypnol as metabolite was detected in the urine, but no active drug or metabolite was detected in the blood. Blood alcohol was nil."" 

183He said that he left her in bed to rest and joined his two friends Cochrane and Mr Nick Samartis at Dittos on Victoria Street, Darlinghurst. He said that his friends had already eaten. He ordered some food but said that before it arrived ""Rene then called me to pick Graham Richardson up from the restaurant"" so he left before he ate his lunch and drove down to the restaurant in East Sydney . 

184Cochrane agreed that the three friends had met for lunch at Dittos. He indicated that the applicant did not mention that he had a prior lunch arrangement with Ms Byrne. Cochrane recalled the phone conversation that the applicant took and said that after that call the applicant immediately left and went without waiting for his lunch. Samartis said that the applicant appeared to be his usual self on that day. 

185Mr Michael Jaggard was the owner of the Alife restaurant in East Sydney in 1995. He gave his first statement to police almost 9 years after the event. He said that Rene Rivkin did dine at his restaurant on Wednesday 7 June 1995. Jaggard said that the applicant dropped Rivkin off in ""one of the Bentleys... I think it was a convertible."" He also said that he was a ""car fanatic."" I doubt whether his recollection is correct. When it was suggested to him that the convertible Bentley he described was not owned by Rivkin until 23 October 1995 he responded, ""I thought that's what I saw."" 

186Jaggard said that when the applicant returned to the restaurant to collect Rivkin at around 3 pm, ""Gary"" accompanied him, meaning Redding . Redding came to know the applicant through Rivkin. Jaggard said he saw that ""Gordon had a brief conversation with Rene. Gary was sort of standing back a little bit. The discussion looked a little bit heated."" Redding could not recall whether he had been at the Alife restaurant that afternoon. 

187Jaggard also gave evidence that in a conversation with the applicant, a few months after the death of Ms Byrne, the applicant said to him on two occasions, ""don't tell anybody that you saw me at your restaurant that day or kind of, you know, or else."" Jaggard described the applicant as ""red-faced angry"" when he approached him. Jaggard suggested that the applicant had offered him shares in the UK to ""keep quiet."" Jaggard said that he was fearful of the situation. 

188Mr Graham Richardson gave evidence that the police approached him in 2000 regarding his lunch arrangements on 7 June 1995. Richardson said that his diary entry for lunchtime on 7 June 1995 read ""1.30 pm San Fran Grill Peter Moore"" with two telephone numbers. Rothfield, a journalist with the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph newspapers, gave evidence that he wrote an article, ""Super Deal in Moore's lunch pack,"" for his column on 11 June 1995. The article concerned the lunch on 7 June 1995 at the San Francisco Grill at the Hilton Hotel between Mr Peter Moore and Richardson. Richardson accepted that he regularly met with Rivkin, that he often arranged ad hoc meetings and that he could not rule out that he had lunch or coffee with Rivkin the day before or after 7 June 1995 or even the morning of 7 June 1995. 

189During the day, Ms Byrne's family and friends had unsuccessfully attempted to contact her. When they telephoned her mobile telephone they were greeted with the standard Telstra message indicating that the telephone was switched off or out of range. 

190Blumenfeld and Butler also telephoned the apartment at noon and 3.30 pm respectively. There was no answer and each left a message on the answering machine. Ms Byrne's brother also telephoned the apartment at about 4 pm indicating that he had arrived home from overseas. They had previously arranged to meet up at Mr Byrne's home on the Wednesday night. 

191Mr Byrne telephoned his daughter's mobile phone between 5.30 and 8 pm but there was no answer. He telephoned the landline between 6.30 and 7 pm and again there was no answer. Mr Byrne also telephoned the applicant's mobile telephone before 8 pm but it was not answered. 

192Rivkin left two pager messages with the applicant at 7.38 and 8.33 pm telling him to turn on his telephone. However, the applicant did not respond, which may be consistent with his claim that he had fallen asleep. 

193The applicant said that he recalled dropping Richardson off after lunch between 2 and 2.30 pm to ""either the Packer Building, AC, ACP or the Rugby League Building 'cause he was working on the Rugby League thing."" By that stage, as he had not eaten, he said that he went down to the Lamrock Cafe in Bondi, which a friend operated, to eat a burger. After that he said ""I probably ran a few errands."" Between 3 and 4 pm the applicant said he went home to see how Ms Byrne was but she was not there. He said ""I figured she'd done one of the things I suggested, like going and see her dad or maybe she'd gone to meet Natalie or maybe she'd gone to the psychiatrist or the doctor or Carel."" He said that he went back to work and returned home around 6.45 or 7 pm. Ms Byrne was not home when he arrived. 

194The applicant always maintained that he had not been at Watsons Bay at 1 pm or around 3 pm. The applicant's phone records indicate that he made calls for work at around midday and telephoned Cochrane at 1.18 pm. From 3 to 4 pm the applicant made three work-related calls when his user location was identified as ""Eastern Suburbs."" 

The applicant ' s account of his movements on the Wednesday evening 

195The applicant gave a detailed account of his movements in his interview with police on 14 June 1996. The applicant said that he arrived home just as the ABC news on television was starting. He said that he ""fell asleep instantly"" on the couch and woke up ""some time around elevenish, eleven-thirtyish."" In an earlier statement the applicant indicated that he woke up at ""12.40am."" He said ""Caroline wasn't home and there was something seriously amiss."" He knew something was wrong because ""she would never ever ever ever ever go out without telling me where she was going."" He tried to ring her but said that her phone did not answer and he realised he had told her to turn her phone off. He said that he left a scribbled note at home saying ""If you come home, call me on mobile."" He said that he then went down to the car park where they usually parked their car. When he could not find the car he said that he ran down to Crown Street and took one of Rivkin's cars, an F100 utility, which he used on occasion. 

196The applicant said he went to Ms Byrne's father's apartment to see if Ms Byrne's car was parked there. He drove around the outside of the building and did not see the car. He did not go into the internal car park of the building although it was suggested to him that he would have known that she parked there when visiting her father. He said that he then went up Oxford Street and then to Bondi, ""once up to South Bondi round the cafes and once back."" He said that he then went to Camp Cove, which he described as ""where we used to go for our picnics."" He did not locate Ms Byrne. He said that he then drove back through Watsons Bay and saw Ms Byrne's car in Gap Lane. He could not remember whether he went up the lane or not. He said that he saw her car parked at the bottom of the steps and said ""at that point I felt sick and I thought, 'Well, she's jumped off the Gap."" 

197When asked how he knew to go to the area of the Gap in his interview on 14 June 1996, the applicant said, ""I can't tell you exactly why I went to the Gap. I mean, it was the last place I went to of the places I did go to. I think I went primarily to Camp Cove...I think on the way back from Camp Cove I suppose maybe subconsciously or instinctively I picked up that Caroline wasn't her normal self for the last few days..."" 

198In the same interview, when asked how he found Ms Byrne's car he said he ""just had a feeling...I believe in spirituality and all that and I think the kind of connection Carol and I had was very strong...I think there was some kind of spiritual communication to me that was occurring to me subliminally to go there."" 

199At the trial, and before this Court, the Crown argued that the applicant could not possibly have seen Ms Byrne's vehicle parked on Gap Road from Military Road, as he claimed in his various statements to the police. According to the Crown, as Ms Byrne's white Suzuki Vitara was not visible from Military Road, it followed that the only way the applicant could have known about its location was if he had killed her. It was submitted that this was yet another example of ""esoteric knowledge"" which the applicant had about the circumstances surrounding Ms Byrne's death. 

200There are difficulties with the Crown submission. The first is that there is no basis in the evidence from which it could be concluded that Ms Byrne's vehicle, which was beneath a streetlight, would not have been visible from Military Road. The prosecutor attempted to elicit evidence to this effect from one of the fishermen, Wano, but the trial judge disallowed the question. The point was not pressed again until the Crown's closing address, in which the prosecutor submitted ""that you would not have been able to see the Vitara up that laneway with the fishermen's car parked behind it."" However, the evidence from Wano and Brunetta was to the effect that Brunetta parked his blue Holden Torana - a vehicle lesser in height than Ms Byrne's four-wheel drive - one to two metres behind Ms Byrne's car. 

201The second problem with the Crown's theory is that the applicant's own words do not support it. When interviewed a second time by the police on 14 June 1996, the applicant said he could not recall whether or not he only saw Ms Byrne's vehicle when he passed through Gap Road. The applicant's account of the events on the ""Witness"" program does not contradict this account. When interviewed a third time by police in 2001, the applicant elaborated on the issue: 

""Well, this [question about the point from which the applicant saw Ms Byrne's car at the Gap] is where it's very loose, and I seem to be uncertain. Why would I drive up that lane? I can assume I went up the lane because I saw her car ... maybe, hang on, maybe I went up the lane because I was scared that she, you know, had done something stupid ... Because it's after all in the middle of the night, and she's not around and her car isn't around. And maybe at this stage I am beginning to get scared she's done something. I don't know Gary. But I don't, I would imagine 6 years later, logically, that I went up the lane 'cause I saw her car. 

... 

I cannot tell you definitively if I saw her car and then went down the lane or that I went down the lane because of instinct, or whether I went down the lane because I'd done that road and not that road. I can't tell you"" (emphasis added). 

202In light of the applicant's statements, which were not contradicted by evidence from the Crown, the question whether Ms Byrne's car was visible from Military Road is of no moment. There remains the reasonable possibility that the applicant saw Ms Byrne's vehicle from Military Road, or that the applicant travelled down Gap Road and only saw Ms Byrne's car at that point. 

203The applicant said that he ran up the stairs towards the Gap in the pitch black and saw two fishermen. He asked them if they had seen a girl and they said no. After searching for a while and shouting out to Ms Byrne the whole time, he said he called Ms Byrne's father and brother from a local phone booth as his phone battery had died. Peter Byrne put this phone call at around 12.30 am. 

204The applicant then went and picked up Mr Byrne and Peter and they returned to the Gap. Peter described the applicant as ""frantic,"" ""emotional, speaking quickly"" and ""driving way too fast."" When Peter asked the applicant how he knew where to find Ms Byrne, the applicant apparently said, ""I don't know, Pete. I don't know. I just had this feeling."" Peter said that when they arrived in Gap Lane, ""he appeared to be opening the door [of the Suzuki Vitara] with a key...he bent down into the car...and when he came back up he had Caroline's wallet in his hand."" Peter said that he opened the wallet and noticed some paper money and handed the wallet to Mr Byrne. Peter was not certain what happened to the wallet after that. 

205When they moved away from the streetlight Mr Byrne said, ""it became so dark and so black that I could not see the ground in front of me."" They found the fishermen at Dunbar anchor who reluctantly lent them a torch. 

206On returning with the Byrnes to the Gap the applicant said in his 1996 interview that the following occurred: 

""This time they lent us the torch, and we walked around flashing the torch everywhere. Tony sort of stayed roughly in that area. Pete and I went with the torch, and Pete was holding the torch and flicking it over the side and at one point - it must be near where the path ducks into the edge of The Gap - he was holding the torch and I said, What's that, what's that down there? Is that - looks like sneakers or something. And he shone the torch and at the time in the dark it looked like it was a ledge only like 10 or 15 feet down, 'cause it wasn't a very powerful torch, and I thought I could see something that looked like a sneaker. He said to me, No, no, it isn't. So I naturally wanted to believe that. And so we then went off and her father said, No, it's over, let's get the police. She's gone. She's gone, Gordon, that's it. She's gone. He said - he kept saying that and I remember shouting at him, saying, No she hasn't, no she hasn't, and then I said, Pete, there's one other place we can look, and we ran up the other end of The Gap, the south end, and I don't know whether you know but over the fence there's a, there's a ledge with a little hole in the rock and I remember when we walked down - the time Caroline and I walked down I told her about this little hole where you climb through it and there's a ledge under there. When I was at university we used to sit - go up there and sit and watch the sun rise sort of thing. So I said, Let's go and look in there and I got the torch and went down and looked there and she wasn't there obviously. So then we came back and the three of us - and her father was calling us from the car, 'cause I remember thinking, He's found her, so we went back to the car and he hadn't. He said, We've gotta tell the police she's gone, that's it. So we went and reported it to the police and they filled out a form and everything and then Tony said he wanted to go home and he said, Come on, let's go home, Pete, we've just gotta go home, so I took Tony and Pete home and they stayed at - back at the Connaught. I went - I forgot; at some point when I, either when I went to got - get them in the first place or when I took them home - I think when I took them home - I went home to get another battery for my phone, rang my mum and my sister, went back to The Gap. By the time I got back to The Gap - missed out a bit, sorry."" 

207The evidence at the trial satisfies me beyond any doubt that no one would have been able to identify Ms Byrne's body from the top of the cliff. 

208Peter Byrne said that the applicant pointed down towards the rocks and said, ""Look Pete, down there. I can see legs and a body. It looks like legs and a body."" Peter responded, ""I can't see anything down there, I can't make out anything."" Peter also gave evidence of a phone call from the applicant on 8 June 1995 after Ms Byrne's body was recovered. The applicant said ""It was where we were looking Pete, it was the spot where we were looking. That's where they found her."" In 2003, in a walk-through interview with police, eight years after the event, Peter said that the applicant was pointing in the direction of Pyramid Rock. That evidence is somewhat troubling. If as all the evidence indicates it was a ""pitch black"" night and the rocks could not be seen from the cliff top it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to determine that the applicant was pointing to pyramid rock. 

209Sgt Paul Griffiths of Rose Bay Police Station said that in the early hours of 8 June 1995 the applicant came into the police station and said to him, ""I'm pretty sure my girlfriend has jumped off the Gap...I'm pretty sure I know where she is."" 

210In his first statement to police on 12 June 1995, he said ""I saw what I thought was shoes at the base for [sic] the cliff however Peter said that he didn't believe they looked like shoes."" 

211In his interview with police on 14 June 1996 he gave another account of whether he could see Ms Byrne from the cliff top. He said: 

""Well I don't think I could see her with that torch. When I - when Pete was holding the torch over the edge, I said to him, I think there's something there, and he held the torch and between he and I we decided it wasn't anything. And that, because of the weak torch and, as I said to you earlier, that to me seemed like it was like on the ledge 10 or 15 feet down at the tops, like this - you know, the height of this ceiling. Because I remember saying No it cant be or he said, It cant be - I think he said, It can't be because its too big for a foot to be at the bottom of the Gap. It's, you know - he dismissed it like that. So I don't think I did see her with the weak torch but I certainly did see her legs with the powerful torch which was - but I - where we were looking with our little torch was like right against the cliff face but where she was was like substantially away from where I thought we were looking."" 

212When asked whether it was actually in a different area, the applicant responded: 

""No question of that, yeah. I mean we, we were looking along the edge of the rock - as you stand on the top...there's only one point you can lean over and kind of get close to the edge and that's that point where the path comes to the edge of the Gap."" 

213This issue was also discussed on the ""Witness"" program in 1998. The applicant said: 

""I think it was probably around this point where you can sort of get close enough to the railing to see some of it down there, but then we only had a handheld torch so I mean I would imagine we would be looking at the rocks just a metre or so below us, because you couldn't see down there and I don't know, I really don't know, I think we just really wanted to see her, to find her y'know."" 

214Friends of the applicant and Ms Byrne also gave evidence of conversations with the applicant after Ms Byrne's death about him seeing her from the top of the cliff. 

215Cameron said that he met the applicant and Cochrane on 10 June 1995 at Bondi and they drove to the Gap where the applicant pointed to the spot where Ms Byrne's body landed. During Cameron's evidence in chief, the prosecutor read out part of Cameron's interview to police in May 2001. Cameron said, ""he [the applicant] got the torch, he shone it around, he showed it around. He told us that he saw her ankle from the spot that he was, that he could see her shoe, her ankle skin and some portion of the lower leg of the trouser."" 

216Cook gave evidence of a conversation she had with the applicant on 10 June 1995 in which he told her his movements on the night of Ms Byrne's death. She said, ""He said he went and looked - he looked over the Gap and he could see her or he could see her shoes...and he was very adamant that he - he kept telling me that he had found her; that he was the one that found her and that he could see her shoes."" Butler also said that from a conversation with the applicant, ""he could see her shoes"". Watson said that she had a similar recollection. 

217After a time Mr Byrne suggested they call police and Mr Byrne said he wanted to go home. The applicant took Mr Byrne and Peter back to their home. Mr Byrne described the applicant as ""agitated,"" ""upset"" and ""nervous."" Once he had dropped the Byrnes' off, the applicant returned to his apartment to replace his phone battery. He also said that he checked for clothes that were missing from Ms Byrne's cupboard. He rang his mother and sister and returned to the Gap where he met them at approximately 5.30am. 

218The police initially came to the Gap with only hand-held torches. They searched the car. The applicant said it was either at this point or earlier in the night that he found Ms Byrne's wallet on the floor of the car. The Police Rescue Squad then arrived together with a helicopter and a patrol boat. The applicant said that he remembered thinking ""that's ridiculous, you're in the wrong area. And I said to one - they had these big torches that threw a square of light and I remember saying to one of the cops holding that, I said, 'Have a look down there'...And he shone the torch in the general direction and it lit up most of the rocks down there and I could see her legs."" 

219Sgt Powderly said that as he swept across the rocks at the base of the Gap with the Mitrolux light, he heard a male voice say: ""That's her. That's the clothes she was wearing."" The applicant was asked by the interviewer on the ""Witness"" program how he knew that she was wearing those clothes and he responded that he ""went back to the apartment to find out when I got my mobile phone after I dropped her father and brother back I went to the apartment specifically to find out what she was wearing."" He said it was easy to work out what she was wearing because Ms Byrne ""only owned one denim jacket, she owned one pair of runners and she had two pairs of black tights. Simple."" 

220This statement was challenged by the prosecution and asserted to be a lie. However it was excluded by the trial judge as a lie evidencing guilt. 

221In making that challenge the prosecution emphasised the evidence of Natalie Butler and Deanna Byrne. 

222In her statement Butler, who was a friend of Ms Byrne, said that the applicant and Ms Byrne had gone on a $1,000 shopping spree for clothes. 

223Ms Byrne's sister, Deanna, said that at some stage after arriving back in Australia she went with the applicant and Ms Butler to go through Ms Byrne's belongings. She indicated that Ms Byrne ""had so many clothes. I mean, she loved shopping for one, and plus she was a model."" She could not say how many tights Ms Byrne had but she said ""she would have had numerous amounts because she went to the gym."" 

224The police said to the applicant that they would probably get him to identify Ms Byrne's body at the top of the cliff if she was not too badly injured. However, as it happened she was considered too badly damaged ""so I would go to the morgue and they'd clean her up and I'd view her at the morgue and identify her."" The applicant returned with the police to the police station before attending the morgue. Ms Wood, the sister of the applicant, said that they were at the police station for ""30 minutes."" 

225Peter Byrne said that the applicant called the Byrne family home at 5am to say the police had recovered the body of Ms Byrne. According to Peter, the applicant also said ""It was where we were looking Pete, it was the spot where we were looking. That's where they found her."" 

The next day 

226Rivkin was curious to know what had happened. The applicant met him at the Lamrock Cafe at Bondi in the morning. Rivkin wanted to tell his wife but Mr Byrne had said to the applicant, ""I don't want anybody to know that she committed suicide,"" so he [the applicant] asked Rivkin if he would tell his wife that she was killed in a car accident. The applicant said that: ""for a period of time I told people that she got knocked over by a car but then - I told Natalie that on the Thursday and I then I think the next day I told her the truth and then I told her agent Gordon."" 

227In the ""Witness"" interview in 1998 the applicant referred to the fact that Ms Byrne's mother had committed suicide and said that Ms Byrne had made two attempts on her life (in fact she made only one attempt), which occurred shortly after her mother's death. However, he said that it never occurred to him before she died that Ms Byrne was suicidal. He said he knew she was not herself and was depressed but did not anticipate her committing suicide. 

228Ms Byrne's mobile phone was not seen by anyone on the night of Ms Byrne's death nor in the days following. It was used again on 9 June 1995 when the diversion was switched back on. 

229There was some controversy about receipts for the purchases made by Ms Byrne. At about 3.00 pm on the 8 June 1995 the applicant went to Mr Byrne's apartment and said, ""the police have found receipts in Caroline's wallet which show - the receipts show that she was out there that day and the day before, and the receipts show that she had left a trail."" Mr Byrne gave evidence that when the applicant recovered Ms Byrne's wallet on the previous night, he did not notice the presence of any receipts. 

230The next day the applicant told Mr Byrne that he had traced Ms Byrne's steps which included: ""After I left her at lunchtime she would have got up out of bed not long after I had left to go back to work. She's got dressed, gone over and got the car, and then she's virtually left a trail. She's used her card at Paddington and then she has used her card again at Vaucluse, virtually leaving a trail. She's then hung around out at around Watsons Bay and then at about 6.00 pm, she's taken her own life."" 

231Included in the three receipts was a paper-free withdrawal slip which did not indicate on its face that the withdrawal was made from the Vaucluse branch. The Crown case was that the applicant must have had this knowledge by reason of the fact that he was either with Ms Byrne or she had told him about the withdrawal. 

Applicant returns to Kings Cross car park 

232At the trial, Mr Donald Macmillan, the proprietor of the Kings Cross car park, gave evidence that the applicant told him on the Monday following Ms Byrne's death that he had obtained a copy of the movements of the Vitara from the manager, Mr Warwick White, as they required it for the Coroner. Macmillan told White that he was not to provide any further information to the applicant. According to the evidence of White, in response to the initial request he gave the applicant the print out and highlighted the movements of the car but he could not recall what the records showed. 

233Macmillan said that he made a print out of the records within weeks of the initial request and placed them in a sealed envelope before it was collected by the police within a month of Ms Byrne's death. However, Sgt Woods who was leading the investigation at the time said that he did not obtain any records from the car park. Sgt Tony Deas confirmed that any material he obtained would have been filed with the investigating documents. 

234Both Macmillan and White gave evidence that old files in their computer system were corrupted when the system was upgraded. As a result, police were not able to obtain a copy of the records. 

235In his closing address, the prosecutor made submissions in relation to the decision by the applicant to visit the car park to obtain records of when her car may have left the complex. He said: 

""Within hours of Caroline's death, the accused has the presence of mind to go to Mr White, who worked at the Kings Cross Car Park, to ask Mr White for the car park records for the Suzuki Vitara. Mr White provided him with those records. 

A week later, the accused goes back to Mr White and asks for another copy, telling Mr White 'This is required for the Coroner.' 

Now, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, why on earth would the accused want to have the car park records for Caroline's car? We submit the only rational reason is he wanted to make sure that his story that he was going to advance to the police was going to account for, or accommodate, whenever it was that Caroline's car had left that car park, because there was an E record there. Goodness only knows why he wanted to get another copy, but he deliberately lied to Mr White when he said that he was required for the Coroner. Of course by the time the police came to that car park, the records were no longer available for a whole lot of reasons that were given in evidence that I don't need to remind you of."" 

236The prosecutor's assertion is tenable but to my mind it is reasonable that, although innocent, the applicant would make inquiries about what happened to Ms Byrne on the day of her death. Any rational person would seek to retrace her steps and try to put the events into some perspective. At best, this evidence is ambivalent. 

Credibility of Mr Tony Byrne 

237The applicant submitted that Mr Tony Byrne was discredited in his evidence and this Court should be very cautious in accepting any evidence that depends on his account. The applicant submitted that this was particularly important with respect to the Offset Alpine issue as it was Mr Byrne's evidence that provided the majority of the material upon which the claim is based. 

238The applicant emphasised examples of contradictory accounts in evidence, which he submitted discredited Mr Byrne. Mr Byrne gave evidence that on 25 December 1993 at 2.30 to 3 pm the applicant answered a call from Rivkin who he said told him that there was a fire the night before and he had to pick up Rivkin from the airport at 7 pm. Mr Byrne says Rivkin later returned to play scrabble, remaining with the Byrne family until 9 to10 pm. In fact, a Department of Immigration form, which the applicant tendered, showed that Rivkin did not return to Australia until 29 December 1993. Mr Byrne's account was not accurate, at least as to the date. 

239Mr Byrne also claimed that in March 1994 the applicant told him that he had purchased shares in Offset Alpine and that the share price was rising. Mr Peter Riordan, a solicitor with the ASC in 1995, said that there was no evidence that the applicant had ever owned shares. Of course, this does not mean that Mr Byrne did not accurately report what he had been told. Although on reading his evidence it is plain that Mr Byrne did not like or trust either Rivkin or the applicant, I am not persuaded that his evidence should be disregarded. However, as I discuss elsewhere, the suggested evidence of a motive involving Rivkin is so thin that it should never have been left with the jury. 

Andrew Blanchette 

240Blanchette was a former boyfriend of Ms Byrne. 

241He was previously a police officer but was medically discharged in 2000. By the time he gave evidence at the trial he had resigned from the police service and was employed as an investment manager. 

242Blanchette gave evidence that he was first asked to remember what he was doing on 7 June 1995 in 2008. He said that he first became aware that he was being considered a suspect for Ms Byrne's murder during his cross-examination. 

243There was evidence from Mr Byrne and friends of Ms Byrne of arguments which occurred between Ms Byrne and Blanchette in the months before her death. In May 2008 Det Insp Jacob became aware that the applicant's representatives were suggesting that Blanchette should have been considered a suspect. This suggestion was contained in draft memoirs prepared by the applicant. However, the applicant had never suggested that the death was anything other than suicide and the applicant had never requested that further inquiries be made about Blanchette. 

244In the first two weeks of April 1995, Ms Byrne told her father of an argument she had had with Blanchette. She had come back from June Dally-Watkins to pick up her car which was parked at the building her father managed. She walked into his office and said, ""Oh daddy, that Andrew Blanchette, he was waiting for me outside Dally's."" She said a terrible argument developed and everybody stopped and looked. 

245A statement of cafe owner, Mr Ernest Velonas, dated 6 June 1996 was tendered at the trial. Roughly three or four months before Ms Byrne died, Velonas said he saw her involved in an argument with a uniformed police officer. Blanchette denied that he had been involved in an argument. 

246Blanchette and Ms Byrne apparently discussed the applicant on occasions. Around six weeks before her death, Blanchette and Ms Byrne had dinner together in East Sydney. The dinner was interrupted when she received a phone call. Blanchette said that he could hear a male voice ""screaming"" at her. She went white. Blanchette said that he tried to calm her but she said she had to go and left immediately. 

247Mr Byrne reported to a Dr Schultz that ""Blanchette had become aggressive and stalked and rang Caroline, and whenever he knew where she was, he would ring and make funny phone calls."" On his own evidence, Blanchette was also cold and dismissive towards her in the week or days before her death. He said, ""She wouldn't let go. I asked her to leave me alone at that time."" Blanchette was also accused of stalking and violence towards her by his former girlfriend MM, who he dated from late 1995 to 1998. 

248According to the evidence of Blanchette's former girlfriend MM, he slept over at her house on 7 June 1995. She said that she went to sleep around 10 to10.30 pm. At that time Blanchette was still in her bed. She said that she woke up at midnight to 1am and found Blanchette was not in bed. It did not concern her and she assumed he had gone home. She went to the kitchen to get water and did a ""loop"" around the house but did not see him. When she got up the following morning between 6 and 7am MM saw Blanchette and asked where he had been in the night. He said he was in the sunroom as something was troubling him and he could not sleep. 

249Blanchette had previously displayed animosity towards the applicant. He admitted in his evidence telling Ms Byrne that the applicant was ""gay"" in the weeks before she died. However, he admitted that he had no reliable information to that effect. He also told Mr Byrne that the applicant was ""a faggot"" and had implied that Rivkin was the applicant's partner. He had encouraged Mr Byrne to compile documents for the police in relation to Ms Byrne's death and encouraged the investigation. 

250Mr Byrne gave evidence of a conversation between him and Blanchette. Blanchette told him that there was a lot of gossip around the City Gym that the applicant and Rivkin were ""faggots."" Byrne said he took it as ""sour grapes"" because Blanchette had quite strong feelings for Ms Byrne. 

251The evidence did not support the defence theory that Blanchette may have been the killer. Although Blanchette's account that he had been at MM's house all night was not corroborated, there was nothing to implicate him in Ms Byrne's murder or suggest that he was at the Gap at the relevant time. 

252As part of his routine duties as a police officer at Newtown Police Station, Blanchette together with Snr Const Nick Pitchuev attended the Glebe mortuary at around 8.30 or 9am on Thursday, 8 June 1995. While Snr Const Pitchuev was upstairs for a Coronial inquest, Blanchette looked at the admissions book at the morgue. He said, ""It was common practice to have a look at some of the entries."" He said that as he was checking through the admission book, he received a call from Duval, a very good friend and fellow policeman at Newtown at the time. Duval told Blanchette that Ms Byrne was dead and that she was hit by a car. Blanchette responded, ""I'm at the morgue, I'm at the morgue now...I'll call you back."" Blanchette said, ""I went straight to the admission book. And I think it was one of the last, or one of the last entries saying it was an unidentified woman there. And yeah, I read the entry. Said it was believed to be Caroline Byrne, awaiting some dental records."" 

253Blanchette spoke to the morgue admission attendant and asked him to look for certain identifying marks on her body. ""She had an incision on her right knee, a little small one centimeter by one centimeter cross where she had a cyst removed when she was a kid. She had a mole in the exact same position as myself - we used to laugh about it as kids - on the left hand side of her shoulder."" The attendant did not go to check those features. 

254There was evidence from Ms Blumenfeld that she had not called Duval until around midday on 8 June 1995 to tell him of Ms Byrne's death. From this evidence the applicant made the suggestion that Blanchette had independently examined the morgue book for the presence of Ms Byrne's name. 

255Blanchette recalled being stopped by the applicant on the side of the road later that day and was told that Ms Byrne was hit by a car and had died. Blanchette said, ""That is absolute bullshit...I am going to find out what happened."" He told the applicant that he had been at the morgue and had read the entry in the morgue admissions book. 

256On Friday, 3 October 2008, the Friday before MM gave evidence at the trial Blanchette, who had long ceased his relationship with MM, rang her. Shortly after the conversation, MM contacted Det Sgt Matthew Moss and made a statement. According to MM's statement, Blanchette said in their telephone conversation: 

""I need to talk to you about what is going on. You are going to be put through the ringer by the defence. I'm sorry that you have been brought into this. This has nothing to do with you. You have to listen to what I am saying. The defence are going to be very hard on you. There is stuff that I know they are going to say about you. You have no idea. And you need to know what they are going to say."" 

257The statement continued: 

""Whilst I was talking to Andrew I could hear what sounded like coins dropping in a pay phone. I said 'I know what the truth is. I have done my statement. There is nothing I have done wrong that they could bring up in Court'. He said, 'I remember that night. I was already in bed and you came in and got into bed. I felt uncomfortable and that's why I got out.' I said, 'That's a load of bullshit. I have a good memory of that night also.'"" 

258Blanchette insisted that they meet in person to discuss these matters. He said, ""I don't care where I have to go but I need to see you."" 

259When MM responded, ""I won't be meeting you. There is nothing to discuss. I have made a statement. Everything I have said has been the truth,, Blanchette responded, ""Okay, nobody needs to know about this phone call. It didn't happen,"" 

260Blanchette agreed that he had urged further investigation of Ms Byrne's death (including speaking to Mr Byrne and Dally-Watkins). He agreed that in a number of statements he had said that he did not think she had committed suicide (in statements made in 1996, 2000 and 2004). Blanchette did not tell the truth to the police about his contact with Ms Byrne in his statement dated 4 April 1996, telling them he had not seen her since they split up. He spoke to the Coroner himself about the investigation. 

261These actions by Blanchette raise suspicion about his integrity. However, there is no reason to doubt the evidence of MM and whatever motive Blanchette may have had for talking with her about her evidence, it does provide him with an alibi at least up until 10 to 10.30 pm, making it most unlikely that he had any involvement with Ms Byrne's death at 11.30 pm. His urging that her death be further investigated is not consistent with his being the killer. 

The 1996 video 

262Sgt Powderly was the first person to descend the cliff and reach the point where Ms Byrne's body had lodged in the rocks. He was there for 1 hour and 20 minutes altogether. He identified that she was dead and called for extra equipment from Police Rescue, including a Larkin frame to enable the body to be taken to the cliff top. He was joined by Snr Const Camwell who assisted in removing the body which had become wedged in the rocks. By the time the body was retrieved rigor mortis had set in. The night was dark and, out of a concern for his comfort and safety, Sgt Powderly said that he did not wait beside the body but moved himself to a position where he was protected from the incoming waves behind a large rock. He said that he waited there for 40 to 45 minutes. While he was waiting to retrieve the body he tried to work out the point at which Ms Byrne may have left the cliff top. He said that he did this by working out ""where the feet were pointing [which he said was]... at the edge of the cliff right on the corner of that fence where I conducted the third view with the Mitrolux light."" Although controversy later emerged as to where the body was located, he did not change his view as to the point at which Ms Byrne left the cliff top. 

263The police, including Sgt Powderly, originally assumed that Ms Byrne had committed suicide. However, there were no witnesses to the event, there was no suicide note, and the police, as they reasonably were required to do, did not terminate their investigation into the tragedy. In 1996 the police decided to record a video which would be made available to media organisations in an endeavour to seek out persons who may have seen the event or have witnessed other incidents at the time which may assist the police in putting together an account of the relevant events. 

264The police video was in evidence at the trial. It was narrated by Sgt Powderly in the careful manner which the police are trained to adopt when relating the events in which they have been involved. Sgt Powderly was standing on the cliff top and Snr Const Camwell, who had assisted Sgt Powderly to remove the body, traversed to the bottom of the cliff and out onto the rocks. She is shown on the video pointing with both arms to the location where Ms Byrne's body was apparently found. As she does this Sgt Powderly is recorded as saying that ""Snr Const Camwell is now indicating the exact position where the body was found."" Snr Const Camwell was pointing to the spot which has subsequently been referred to as hole B. 

The physics of the issue 

265At trial, the Crown called expert medical evidence from Professors Fryer and Giordian Fulde and scientific evidence from A/Prof Cross and Professor Bruce Elliot. The applicant called medical evidence from Professor John Hilton and Dr Johan Duflou and scientific evidence from Professor Marcus Pandy and A/Prof Ness. A/Prof Cross and A/Prof Kevin Ness have expertise in physics. Profs Elliot and Pandy have expertise in the field of biomechanics. 



266The important features of the Gap are evident in the diagram prepared by A/Prof Cross and tendered into evidence at the trial. 

267In this diagram, hole A is marked ""P,"" hole B is marked ""B,"" the corner fence post is marked ""A"" and the northern ledge is clearly indicated. The southern rock platform is the large area within which the path DE is mapped. It was assumed at the trial that the northern ledge would provide a run up distance of 4 m to a person jumping or a person throwing another. This assumption was challenged by new evidence tendered to this Court. 

268A/Prof Cross said that although he originally concluded that Ms Byrne could have jumped from the southern ledge to hole B he later changed his mind. He said that he altered his opinion after finding out about Ms Byrne's athletic ability and carrying out his experiments. Those experiments included women jumping and being thrown by strong men into a swimming pool. Prof Pandy and A/Prof Ness were not asked about hole B at the trial. 

269The measurements of women running made by A/Prof Cross excluded the possibility of Ms Byrne having jumped to hole A from the northern ledge. However, those conducted with the more sophisticated equipment of Prof Pandy indicated she could. 

270A/Prof Cross said that he had concluded that the ""running speed"" for 13 females aged 20 to 35 years after they had run 4 m ranged from 3.7-4.85 m/sec. In his experiments one of the women tested would have achieved the speed to dive to hole A. However, A/Prof Cross said that none of the police cadets could have jumped to hole A. 

271Prof Pandy, an expert in biomechanics, also conducted several tests with two test subjects to make his own preliminary assessment of running capabilities over 4m. The two tasks required the test subjects to run as fast as possible over 4m on level ground and to run as fast as possible over 4m and then jump. Data was taken over three or four runs by using a video-motion-capture system to calculate velocity by a process of differentiation across nine high-speed cameras and an average of the horizontal speed was determined. Prof Pandy commented on the system's accuracy, stating that ""it's a gold standard in the field."" Test subjects were chosen to match roughly with the proportions of Ms Byrne. Prof Pandy concluded that both test subjects would have been able to reach hole A from the northern ledge given the calculation of required horizontal velocity set out by A/Prof Cross. Both subjects achieved over 4.83 m/s for a run and jump over 4 m. Prof Pandy concluded that both test subjects would have been able to reach hole A from the northern ledge given the calculation of required horizontal velocity set out by A/Prof Cross. 

272Although A/Prof Cross conducted more tests I am in no doubt that, because of the sophistication of his equipment, the tests conducted by Prof Pandy are more reliable. Mr Charles Rosemond, a senior biochemist at the Australian Institute of Sport who gave evidence, accepted that Prof Pandy's results would not have placed his subjects in the category of elite athletes. A/Prof Cross was critical of the speeds predicted by Prof Pandy, saying that they were only possible for an elite athlete. However, he explains that measuring a person's speed over a distance greater than 4 metres may not give a true measure of the person's capacity to accelerate over a short distance. 

273Prof Elliot conducted tests from which he concluded that A/Prof Cross' conclusions were valid. He said: ""In general terms the numbers seem to blend and therefore I was happy that the numbers that he'd reported were in actual fact valid."" 

274A/Prof Ness considered the measurements and calculations compiled by A/Prof Cross and concluded that the calculations were valid. However, he said, ""where we differ on is the uncertainties in these calculations."" These uncertainties he summarised thus: 

""Q: And what do you actually mean by the particular conditions? 
A: We do not know the precise - the starting - the starting velocity, the starting angle, the position in, say, a two-dimensional X and Y information, the actual position in space of the centre of mass of the body and - sorry, and we do not know precisely where the body landed either."" 

275To my mind all of this experimental analysis must be approached with considerable reservation. The tests carried out by A/Prof Cross were all conducted in daylight and in conditions where none of the participants had reason to fear for their safety. The run up was secure and the persons who were thrown were of course cooperative. One test was done where the female volunteer was asked to remain limp. However, even in this experiment she cooperated and facilitated her safe entry into the water. 

276The circumstances on the night of Ms Byrne's death were quite different. It was a ""pitch black"" night, cold (it was the middle of winter) and, having regard to the evidence of Sgt Powderly, the surface areas were likely to have been moist from sea spray or mist. The northern ledge had a gravelly surface and at its edge a sheer drop of about 30 metres. Any person throwing another person over the cliff the required distance in a spear throwing motion (which was suggested by the prosecution) would, with the person above their head, have taken some steps towards the edge, holding the person's neck and groin and in a two handed motion launching them over the edge. The risk to the thrower was obvious and made more significant by the darkness and the lack of any safety protection. If Ms Byrne was conscious at the time she would undoubtedly have struggled to resist being thrown. Prof Elliot, who was called by the Crown, said that ""if someone was struggling, I seriously doubt that you could throw them with any great velocity at all, certainly not with the velocity required to get from the ledge to hole A."" All of the experts agreed that a struggling person would be more difficult to throw. 

277Because of the problem of Ms Byrne struggling if she was conscious, the prosecutor changed tack during the trial and suggested that she may have been unconscious or incapacitated. However, no effective experiments were done to ascertain whether an unconscious Ms Byrne could have been thrown the required distance. 

278The medical experts gave evidence as to the injuries to Ms Byrne's body to assist in understanding how she landed and whether hole A or hole B could be excluded as the landing point. However, to my mind their evidence was inconclusive and, given the controversy as to whether Ms Byrne could have jumped to hole A, does not assist in resolving whether Ms Byrne was thrown off the cliff top. 

279Ultimately there remains a dispute between the academics as to whether Ms Byrne could have jumped or been thrown to hole A. Because of the state of the evidence, I find myself unable to definitively resolve that dispute. The experiments were conducted under ideal conditions and as A/Prof Ness indicated, the variables from the real conditions are such that I am not satisfied that Ms Byrne was thrown from the northern ledge. 

How did the prosecution put its case? 

280Towards the end of his final address to the jury the Crown prosecutor summarised the Crown case in the following terms: 

""The accused met up with Basquali and Samartis between 12 and 1. At some time before 1 pm, the accused dropped off Rene Rivkin at the Alife restaurant. Between 1 pm approximately and 3 pm approximately the accused was at Watsons Bay with Caroline Byrne and a second man, unknown at about 3 pm they, left Watsons Bay. At that stage everything was friendly. 

Shortly after 3 pm following lunch at Watsons Bay, the accused and Gary Redding report to Rene Rivkin at the Alife restaurant. Rivkin becomes agitated. Between 3.30 and 4 pm Caroline Byrne's card is used to do some shopping or banking transactions, at Paddington and Vaucluse. At some stage around 4.30 to 5 pm Caroline Byrne in the Vitara returns to Watsons Bay. We don't know why, what it was that caused her to return to Watsons Bay. 

By 5.14 pm the accused has switched off his phone. By 5.30 pm Caroline Byrne's phone is switched off and her diversion is switched off. Around the same time, the accused's diversion is switched off. At 5.48 pm the accused makes his last mobile phone call for the day until 4.44 am the next morning. He ignores some pager messages from Rene Rivkin and his son around the 7.30 to 8.30 mark. 

At some stage in the evening, the accused and a second male join Caroline at Watsons Bay. At 8'ish Mr Doherty sees the accused and Caroline Byrne with a second man arguing in Military Road. By that stage the situation had become very ugly, with the accused berating Caroline in a very similar manner to the way that he had berated her at the gym the previous Friday. Caroline was cowering in exactly the same way that Christine McVeigh had seen her cowering at the gym the previous Friday. She was still answering him back in a combative manner. 

They continued arguing from about 8pm for about three and a half hours until her death at 11.30 pm. The argument went right up until the scream. The scream was most likely Caroline being rendered unconscious or incapacitated. Her death was not a suicide but a murder. 

The accused by his precise knowledge of where her body was located and by the orientation of her body head down, must have been present with her during the argument and when she went over the Gap. The scream was most likely Caroline being rendered unconscious or incapacitated. 

The accused has no alibi between leaving Basquali and Samartis and meeting up with Peter and Tony Byrne, except for the sighting at the Alife restaurant at 3 pm. 

We submit that the accused had a motive to kill Caroline, and he had the requisite strength to spearthrow her to her death, either on his own or in combination with the second unknown male. We submit the accused caused her death, either on his own or in combination with the second unknown male."" 

281Criticisms are made of the Crown prosecutor's address under ground 6 of the appeal. I shall deal with those issues separately. However, when determining whether the jury's verdict was unreasonable it is important to give careful consideration to the way in which the prosecutor put the Crown case to the jury. 

282The prosecutor accepted that before the jury could convict the applicant they had to be ""satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Caroline Byrne did not commit suicide, because unless the Crown can exclude suicide beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused is entitled to an acquittal."" As was appropriate the prosecutor referred to some of the evidence in the course of his address and invited the jury to draw conclusions from it. In relation to other matters, sometimes critical matters, the prosecutor argued for conclusions based on his own speculative propositions. There is always a danger when a prosecutor takes this course, a danger which the applicant submitted materialised in this case and caused the trial to miscarry. 

283The prosecutor commenced his address by concentrating on the evidence which suggested that the applicant was able to identify Ms Byrne's body on the rock ledge in the dark of the early morning of 8 June. The prosecutor emphasised that the evidence was that the applicant knew where the body was and also knew that her feet were up. The prosecutor submitted that the only way in which the applicant could have known where Ms Byrne was and that her feet were up was if he were ""there when her body went over."" 

284The prosecutor put it in this fashion to the jury: 

""How would he possibly know that she's feet up? He couldn't possibly have known that. If somebody, if you suspected that a loved one had jumped off the Gap, you would think that their body was splat on the rocks. You would not think, 'I can see her feet, I can see ankle skin, I can see the end of the trousers.' The only rational explanation for the accused's knowledge is that the accused was there when she went over the cliff."" 

285The evidence of the others present at the time, particularly Peter Byrne, was that the night was so dark and the presence of spray and wash on the rock shelf was such that, in combination, it was not possible to see anything at the bottom of the cliff. This must mean that the applicant could not have known, even if he was responsible for Ms Byrne falling to her death, that she had lodged in the rock shelf with her feet in the air. There was nothing to suggest that visibility would have been better at the time at which she died compared with the time at which the others who sought to identify her were present. The Crown prosecutor did accept that the applicant was not acting rationally in the early hours of the morning. 

286The Crown prosecutor emphasised that when interviewed in 1996 by Insp Wyver, the applicant appeared to change his story. The prosecutor said that he ""told blatant lies in an attempt to avoid the inevitable conclusion that we say one reaches about his knowledge of where her body was and the orientation of her body."" I accept that in some respects details he gave to Insp Wyver were different to what he is reported to have said on the evening. However, faced with the assertion by others that it was not possible to see anything, it is likely that even an honest person would seek to rationalise their own behaviour on that evening. When challenged about this issue in his interview with the ""Witness"" program, he responded by saying: ""I'd be a bit of an idiot wouldn't I to point to everybody about where she was if I had killed her."" The ultimate difficulty for the Crown submission is that if nothing could be seen that night then, even if the applicant were responsible for her death, he would not have been able to identify where she was and the position of her body. 

287The prosecutor submitted that this issue was the ""bottom line of the prosecution case."" It was said to be ""a killer point, an irrefutable point."" It will be plain that I do not accept that this issue had that impact or indeed was of any particular significance at all. The trial judge said of it: 

""When the Crown prosecutor began his closing address to you, he spoke about what he called the 'bottom line' and the 'killer point'. The prosecutor was referring to the position and attitude of the deceased's body and to evidence of what the accused said at the cliff top, looking down to the rocks below. A number of people gave evidence of what the accused said on that occasion, and there is a dispute about what he said. There is only one contemporary account of what he said, and that is what the accused told the police at Rose Bay. You have exhibit AP, the statement of 12 June 1995 soon after the events. That matter is not touched on in the interview which took place in the following month. 

The evidence of witnesses who have told you what the accused said, or what he told them he had said, is all based on statements which did not come into existence until after this became a murder inquiry in May 1996. An important witness relied on by the Crown is Mr Peter Byrne. You will remember that Mr Byrne senior, on behalf of the Byrne family, told the police that no member of the Byrne family would be giving a statement. There is no evidence that Mr Peter Byrne, when preparing his statement a year or so later, worked from any written note that he had made of what the accused said."" 

288His Honour continued on this issue: 

""921. The issue here is this - and it was postulated for you in, I think, the second or the third of the 50 questions the Crown posed for your attention at the close of his address - it is called ""the bottom line"", ""the killer point"": 

922. ""What did the accused say? Did he say, 'I can see legs and a body'."" 

923. There are various versions in the evidence of the witnesses: Peter Byrne; the ""Witness"" programme (page 10); Constable Griffith (448); Peter Byrne's evidence (at 386) was: ""He stated to me that he could see legs and a body."" That's a pretty strong statement,"" He could see legs and a body."" 

924. Mr Powderly told you that the man who was presumably the accused said ""That's her. That's the clothes she was wearing."" 

925. Mr Gale said at 454, ""The accused said, 'That's her'."" And he said, when asked whether there was any way he could have seen the body at the base of the cliff, he said, ""No, it was not possible."" 

926. And there are various other statements in the evidence of Miss Cook, Miss Butler, Miss Watson. 

927. Mr Cracknell says it was so dark that they couldn't see anything from the helicopter. ""We couldn't see anything"", he said. They had the helicopter there for 25 minutes. 

928. It is difficult to know what to make of that evidence. Why would anybody go to the expense and trouble and, not to say, danger of having a helicopter in a position in which they couldn't see ""anything"" for 25 minutes raises a strong suspicion, I suggest. Perhaps all he meant was they couldn't see a body. 

929. Anyway, he described the light the helicopter had, a very, very powerful one, and he said they couldn't see anything. 

930. This goes to two things: first, the blackness of the night, the difficulty of seeing, you have heard evidence of sea spray; and the things that the accused said. 

931. The accused's account is in his statement. He said he thought he saw - ""I thought I saw."" And the question was raised for you: well, what did he really say? Did he say ""I see legs and a body""; ""I see legs or a body""; or, ""Is that legs or a body?"" and the like. What he said in his statement bears upon the question, but it doesn't say what he said to the police. 

932. Assuming in favour of the Crown that he said - and this is what the Crown submits that you should find - he said, ""I can see legs and a body"", or words having that meaning, the question says to you: how could he possibly have known that unless he had thrown her off the cliff? 

933. The submission put against it is this: how could the fact that he had thrown her off the cliff possibly inform him where the body was, or that the body was in a hole with the legs in the air? 

934. Refer to Crown's question number 3, if you've made a note of it. The Crown asks you: how could he have known that the legs were sticking up if he hadn't thrown her off the top? 

935. What is put against it is, well, if it was a black night, how could he have known by being at the top? Committing a crime doesn't improve your eyesight, or the weather. And there is no evidence that the weather and the visibility were any different between the two times that we're talking about. 

936. The deceased went off the cliff, let's say, at 11.30, some time a little before midnight, and the time of the conversation about which this evidence is given took place some time in the wee small hours, a matter of two hours later, maybe more, well before dawn. 

937. It would be speculative for you to suppose that there might have been a change in the visibility in between times. So how could the accused's statement of what he saw show that he had thrown the deceased off The Gap? 

938. The submission is that he couldn't - either he could see from where he was standing, looking down, talking to Peter Byrne and then to the police, either he could see or he could not. And, if he could see, then he could have seen, of course, when he threw her off The Gap. 

939. But the Crown case is not made out in that case - or the Crown argument is not made good. If he couldn't see from the top - if he couldn't see from where he was saying - well, from where he was speaking next to Peter Byrne and next to the police, he could not have seen from where he threw the deceased off The Gap, if that is what he did. And the answer may simply be that he could see; he was describing what he could see, or what he thought he could see. 

940. How could he see it? Well, there were lights waving around. You will need to ask yourselves whether the evidence that you could not see anything, even with a police magnalite light with full batteries, can stand against this evidence. It is something for you to consider. You have the submissions on both sides. 

941. The Crown says it shows that he knew - he knew the body was in a hole with its feet sticking up, because he had thrown her off the top. 

942. The defence says it is an argument that simply does not run: either he could see or he couldn't. If he could, he could see on both occasions; if he couldn't, he couldn't see on either occasion. 

943. There is evidence that lights were used sweeping around. Think about that, ladies and gentlemen."" 

289In the absence of the jury the Crown prosecutor and trial judge shared the following exchange: 

""950 CROWN PROSECUTOR: Thank you, your Honour. Your Honour, on what has been identified as the Crown's ""bottom line"" point, your Honour said, ""The answer might simply be that he could see."" Your Honour, that is not only contrary to the position that the Crown has taken, but it is contrary to every version that the accused- 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, your position is utterly without logic. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, the logic- 

HIS HONOUR: There must be an explanation. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: The explanation is this, your Honour: that if the accused threw the deceased head first from the top of The Gap- 

HIS HONOUR: He aimed for hole A, did he, or for hole B? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: He may well have assumed she landed head first. 

HIS HONOUR: Oh, come on, Mr Crown, I am not putting that. Is there anything else? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. Your Honour said that there were lights waving around. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes. 


CROWN PROSECUTOR: That was certainly the case when the police were there, particularly once the helicopter and the police rescue were there. But it was not the case, of course, when he was there with Peter Byrne. 

HIS HONOUR: So he couldn't see? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: And couldn't have known. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: That's his account as well, your Honour, on every version he gives. 

HIS HONOUR: That's the problem with this, Mr Crown. With respect, it is an utterly illogical submission you have made and it deserves to be destroyed. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, with respect, we don't accept that. 

HIS HONOUR: You don't have to, but you have got it."" 

290The Crown prosecutor then turned in his address to the evidence of the relationship between Ms Byrne and the applicant. The prosecutor's submission was that the relationship had been deteriorating and that the applicant had become very aggressive and abusive towards Ms Byrne. 

291In support of this submission the prosecutor referred to the evidence of the applicant speaking to others about his affection for Ms Byrne. The prosecutor put against this evidence the evidence of Georgiou that in discussions in February or March Ms Byrne was in the gym and told him that things were not going well with the applicant. He said that she suggested that things were getting to a similar position to when the relationship was terminated approximately 12 months earlier. Georgiou said that Ms Byrne said similar pessimistic things about the relationship to him in early April or May 1995. 

292The prosecutor referred to the evidence from Ms McVeigh about the alleged incident in the gym on the Friday night before Ms Byrne died. The prosecutor connected this event to Rivkin by referring to the fact that Redding (an associate of Rivkin) and his girlfriend were present at the time. Redding of course denied that he was present on this occasion. The Crown conceded that had Redding's girlfriend been called to give evidence, she too would say that she had witnessed no such event. 

293It may be, and I would accept, that an incident such as that described by McVeigh may have occurred but on a different occasion. She was asked to recall the events in 2006 and the denial by Redding, which is plausible, that he was present at the gym on that occasion undermines the reliability of McVeigh's evidence. Furthermore, there is no doubt that on the Friday Ms Byrne was unwell with the flu, making it unlikely that she would have gone to the gym that evening. 

294Having raised this incident with the jury, the prosecutor then used it in an entirely impermissible manner. He told the jury that the Crown submission was that: 

""This argument must have been something very serious, and it must have had something to do with the accused's employment with Rene Rivkin. That's why Gary Redding was standing next to him. I mean, would you have a rip roaring row with your spouse or partner with one of your fellow employees from your work standing next to you? Of course you wouldn't. Neither would the accused if it was something purely personal. It must have had something to do with Rene Rivkin for Gary Redding to be there."" 

295This submission was entirely speculative. If an argument did occur it could have been as a consequence of trouble in the relationship, which had nothing to do with the applicant's employment with Rivkin. Redding was a friend of the applicant's. The fact that he was present (if he was) may have had nothing to do with Rivkin. It is plain that the prosecutor introduced the prospect that the event was related to Rivkin in order to support his theory as to the applicant's motive. It was a speculative smear. 

296In support of his theory that the relationship between Ms Byrne and the applicant was fracturing the prosecutor then turned to the evidence of Ms Geraldine Howarth, who was a fellow model with Ms Byrne at the Gordon Charles Agency. She said that she had gone to the agency on 5 June 1995 to resign. She said that she saw Ms Byrne, who looked upset and appeared to have been crying. Tanya Zaetta had lunch with Ms Byrne on that day. The prosecutor reminded the jury that she had said that Ms Byrne had said to her that ""Gordy and I are having a moment."" 

297Finally, the prosecutor referred to the occasion on 31 May when according to Mr Byrne his daughter visited him and, while she was with him spoke to the applicant on the telephone. After hanging up she said: ""I'll have to go. That was Gordon. He's in a shitty mood."" 

298The prosecutor made the summary submission to the jury that there were 6 witnesses who said there were problems in the relationship between the applicant and Ms Byrne. He told the jury that they should conclude that Ms Byrne would not put up with a relationship on these terms, particularly as she had come from a very polite, supportive, loving family background. This was the foundation for the proffered motive that the relationship had deteriorated to the point where Ms Byrne wanted to terminate it and, rather than lose her, the applicant killed her. 

299The third step in the prosecutor's summation of the Crown case was a submission to the effect that the applicant was under great pressure at the time of Ms Byrne's death. Reference was made to the applicant's expectation of a career with Rivkin and how he believed that employment with Rivkin gave him the prospect of learning how to successfully invest on the stock market. He emphasised the evidence which on the Crown case supported a conclusion that the applicant big noted himself because of his relationship with Rivkin. 

300The prosecutor then turned attention to Rivkin. He reminded the jury that the applicant had gone overseas with Rivkin in relation to the Offset Alpine issue and that Rivkin had been upset about the outcome of the home unit transaction and Mr Byrne's involvement in it. He emphasised the evidence that Ms Byrne had told her father that Rivkin was very depressed on one occasion and had said that he did not want to see the applicant at all because of his relationship with Ms Byrne. He also mentioned the evidence from Mr Byrne that his daughter had said to him that Rivkin was trying to drive a wedge between her and the applicant and that Rivkin was worried about the amount she knew about his business affairs and his private life and that Rivkin was depressed and that it was all because of her. 

301The prosecutor's submission was that by late March 1995 the situation between Rivkin and the applicant had become so bad that the applicant thought he was not going to get his bonuses, he was not going to get the home unit, and he probably would not even have a job. The prosecutor then made reference to evidence that Ms Byrne had told her father in late March that the applicant had a plan ""to get around Rene."" 

302There was no evidence as to what that suggested plan may have been. Shortly after that alleged conversation the applicant went overseas with Rivkin and, of course, continued in his employment. The prosecutor reminded the jury that the relationship between the applicant and Ms Byrne had previously faltered because of her concern that the applicant did not have a job. He told the jury that by late March to early April the applicant was at risk of losing his employment again. He told the jury that they might think that he feared that if he lost his job he would lose Ms Byrne and, as a consequence, his whole self image with his family and his friends was under threat. 

303The prosecutor reminded the jury of the claims which the applicant had apparently made to others about the legitimacy and likelihood of a successful insurance claim in relation to the Offset Alpine fire. The prosecutor said that this information was made available to Mr Byrne, Georgiou and others including ""Caroline."" However, there was no evidence that Ms Byrne actually knew any of the details of any illegitimate dealings. No doubt Rivkin was troubled by the rumours surrounding his dealings in Offset Alpine and it is plain that a successful insurance claim would have restored the company's cash position. As it happened, Offset Alpine was compensated by the insurer and ASIC dropped the investigation into the Offset Alpine matter without laying any criminal charges. 

304The ultimate submission which the prosecutor made was that the applicant ""had confidential information about powerful people, including people in government. He had told people things, including Caroline and Tony and Angelo that you might think would have horrified Rene Rivkin if he knew. So Rene Rivkin had every reason to be paranoid about Caroline and Tony."" 

305The difficulty with this submission is that there was no evidence of any confidential information or that Ms Byrne was aware of any such information about ""powerful people."" Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that Rivkin knew that the applicant had told anyone about confidential information relating to such people. The suggestion that Rivkin was upset and that his concern was sufficient to motivate the applicant to kill Ms Byrne was entirely without foundation. The submission should not have been made. The exploitation of public rumour and the use of mere innuendo to compensate for inadequate evidence of motive is not consistent with the obligations of a prosecutor to press the Crown case ""to its legitimate strength"" by reliance upon credible evidence: per Rand J Boucher v The Queen (1954) 110 CCC 263-275. The prosecutor continued submitting that: 

""Rene Rivkin was paranoid in the first place about Tony [Byrne] particularly, but that then he became absolutely - totally paranoid about what information Caroline had about him and his business affairs and his personal affairs and that is what Caroline said to her father."" 

306It seems that the prosecutor's suggestion of Ms Byrne's knowledge about inappropriate dealings was taken from the evidence of Mr Byrne and Duval. It was brief and, in my opinion, insufficient to support the prosecutor's submission. 

307In around March 1994 Ms Byrne and the applicant came over for dinner to Ms Byrne's parents' home. Mr Byrne gave evidence that: 

""Caroline went into the kitchen and began to prepare the meal, to take it out of the carton and put it on the plates. Gordon and I walked about two metres away from Caroline into the dining room and Gordon produced a, what I saw was a share price indicator ... about the size of a mobile phone and he said 'Offset Alpine Printing are at $1.37. I've recently bought shares in Offset Alpine. The insurance company is going to pay up. The shares are going to go up in price.' Then in a clear audible voice he said, 'The fire was a set-up.'"" 

308When asked whether Ms Byrne appeared to be listening to the conversation, Mr Byrne responded, ""I looked at Caroline at the end of that conversation and she looked up at me."" 

309Duval gave evidence of a conversation with Ms Byrne at the City Gym in late 1994 or early 1995, relating to the ""business of Rene Rivkin,"" in particular in relation to a fire and an ""insurance claim."" He said at that point the applicant came over, asked Ms Byrne to stop talking, then it ""got heated"" between the applicant and Duval. Ms Byrne walked away. No other details of the actual conversation were given. 

310The prosecutor submitted that the applicant was under great stress ""where the woman of his dreams was the subject of paranoia by the employer upon which his whole self esteem was based."" 

311The prosecutor also introduced, as the evidence entitled him to do, the suggestion that there may have been a homosexual relationship between the applicant and Rivkin. I accept that this may have caused Ms Byrne concern. 

312The prosecutor then turned to the evidence of the applicant's apparent possessiveness of Ms Byrne. He submitted that the applicant was a ""control freak"" who oppressed Ms Byrne. The submission which the Crown prosecutor put was that: 

""But, ladies and gentlemen, by the time she spoke to Angelo Georgiou, when the accused had become abusive to her, she realised that his attention to her had a very negative side. It was very dark and unwanted and verging on being stalking, and it had taken on a completely different character. You might think that by that stage she had wised up to how unattractive and unwanted that sort of possessiveness really was. 

So, ladies and gentlemen, by the time of her death you might think Caroline was well aware of the negative side of this absolutely controlling and possessive behaviour of the accused towards Caroline really was [sic]."" 

313The evidence could not support this submission. There was evidence that the applicant was possessive of Ms Byrne and there was evidence of arguments between the two. But the evidence could not support the proposition that the applicant was generally abusive or that his behaviour was ""dark and unwanted"" and verging on stalking as the prosecutor submitted. 

314The prosecutor then submitted that the jury should conclude that the relationship between the applicant and Ms Byrne was unravelling. He said: 

""That he had become very abusive and threatening; that she was scared; that she didn't know how she was going to get out of the relationship cleanly; and, that things were going from bad to worse. 

From his point of view, he stood to lose everything: love, employment, money, future fortune, self esteem, the façade of prestige he had built up with others. His whole life was about to unravel we would submit to you that she must have intimated to him that she wanted out, and it must have been obvious to him that this time it was going to be forever. 

We submit that he decided to make one last desparate attempt to woo her back into their relationship, and that's why he made arrangements for her not to be at work on 7 June 1995. When he failed to convince her to stay in their relationship, he killed Caroline rather than losing her and losing everything else in his life."" 

315I do not accept that there is any significant evidentiary foundation for this submission. There is no doubt that Ms Byrne was reporting depression on the Monday and for that reason went to see her doctor. The evidence is clear that she was troubled about her employment and her future as a model. There is no evidence that she reported any relationship between her depression and problems in her relationship. If this were the case she could be expected to have told Dr Pan about them. 

316The evidence supports the conclusion that, at least in part, the cause for Ms Byrne's unhappiness was the difficulty she was experiencing with her job and the loss of the prospect of a full-time modelling career. If her depression was of sufficient intensity for her to feel that she was unable to work it would be an entirely sympathetic act for the applicant to have sought to arrange a medical certificate to excuse her attendance from work. Furthermore, it is completely understandable that both he and Ms Byrne would not have wanted to disclose to June Dally-Watkins that the reason for her absence was depression, particularly if it was due to her employment concerns. 

317The prosecutor then turned his attention to where Ms Byrne's body had been found and sought to persuade the jury that it could be satisfied that it was found in hole A. It was submitted that the evidence of Sgt Powderly on this issue should be accepted. I discuss this issue elsewhere. I am not persuaded that Sgt Powderly's evidence is entirely reliable. I do not doubt his credibility but the circumstances in which he changed his description of the location cause me to have serious doubts that he ultimately identified the correct position. It must be remembered that not only did Sgt Powderly say on the 1996 video that Snr Const Camwell was pointing to the exact position where the body was located, but Snr Const Camwell herself assisted in retrieving Ms Byrne on that night. It was not until 2004 that Sgt Powderly said that he had made a mistake in 1996. He says that over his time with the police rescue squad he recovered a number of bodies from the Gap. Retrieving, after 9 years have passed, a memory of the precise events on a dark, windy night with sea spray around would be difficult for any person. By the time he was able to revisit the site, A/Prof Cross had become involved and was questioning whether the correct location had been identified. A/Prof Cross' reasoning for doing so appears to have no foundation other than perhaps out of concern to eliminate the possibility of suicide, thus leaving open a prosecution for murder. 

318The prosecutor then turned to examine the evidence as to the means by which Ms Byrne could have ended up in hole A. He submitted that the evidence of A/Prof Cross made plain that Ms Byrne could not have jumped and ended up in that location and accordingly she must have been thrown. The Crown prosecutor said, ""the most persuasive evidence that she did not commit suicide is that she could not have committed suicide to end up in hole A. That really is the be all and end all of it."" This involved acceptance of A/Prof Cross' evidence, which I have indicated was challenged by Prof Pandy. 

319The submission that followed was extraordinary and should never have been made. The prosecutor submitted that Ms Byrne was thrown by the sort of throw that shot putters do: 

""where they hold the ball right close to their shoulders and then go round and round and finally throw the ball from the shoulders using not just their arm's strength but their body strength, all their body strength - their upper shoulders, their body, their lower body, even their legs and feet - to propel that shot put out as far as they can. So that is the sort of action that we are talking rather than a spear. But let's call it a spear throw for the purposes of argument."" 

320This submission was entirely unsupported by any evidence. The evidence of A/Prof Cross described the throw as a spear throw with the applicant (or another person) lifting Ms Byrne above his or her head and throwing Ms Byrne like a spear. The video of the tests which A/Prof Cross conducted did not include an action of throwing anything like that which the prosecutor described. The tests which A/Prof Cross conducted had the thrower holding the woman above his head with his arms apart so as to throw the body using the force of both hands, one near the head and the other near the groin. The suggestion of a shot put action was an invention of the prosecutor during the course of submissions for which there was absolutely no support in the evidence. 

321The prosecutor also submitted that the evidence of A/Prof Cross was that a man who could bench press 100 kilograms would have the strength to spear throw a 57-kilogram woman on his own or in combination with someone else. 

322The prosecutor then advanced the proposition that in all probability Ms Byrne was unconscious or at least incapacitated when she was thrown off the cliff. However, all the experiments which A/Prof Cross conducted had a co-operative subject being thrown. The experiments did not assist in establishing whether a dead or unconscious person could have been thrown the relevant distance. Although Dr Duflou said that the injuries or lack of them on Ms Byrne's body were consistent with her being unconscious, the evidence from the scientists and physics experts did not support that proposition. 

323The prosecutor then suggested that the description of the scream given by the fishermen was inconsistent with Ms Byrne committing suicide. I do not accept that proposition. I have no difficulty with the proposition that someone who has decided to jump may exclaim once they have launched themselves into the air. The evidence of the length of the scream was one or two seconds, about the time it would have taken for her to go from the cliff top to the rocks below. The scream was reported to have diminished in intensity consistent with her falling away from the listener, making it more likely that the person was falling when the scream was emitted. 

324The prosecutor's thesis was that the scream occurred at the time Ms Byrne was rendered unconscious and before she was thrown over the edge. To my mind the evidence suggests otherwise. 

325The prosecutor submitted that the evidence indicated that the scream was preceded by an hour of argument by a female and two males. This suggestion came from the evidence of Doherty. He then told the jury that ""people that commit suicide generally don't argue for an hour beforehand."" There was no evidence to support this proposition and for my part I would not accept it. I have no difficulty with the possibility of someone being involved in an intense argument, and then distressed by that event and perhaps surrounding circumstances, committing suicide. 

326The prosecutor also submitted that the evidence that Ms Byrne had taken $50 from the bank and purchased a Freddo frog and petrol that afternoon were inconsistent with her intending to commit suicide. Again, I would not accept that as a necessary conclusion. I believe it possible that a number of hours after the purchases had been made she could have resolved to take her own life. 

327I have discussed elsewhere the evidence of observations purportedly made of the applicant and Ms Byrne and another person at Watsons Bay in the afternoon and at night on the day she died. Mindful of the inherent difficulties with identification evidence and the problems with the particular evidence in this case I am not persuaded that on either occasion it could be reliably accepted that the applicant or Ms Byrne were observed in the Watsons Bay area. The prosecutor indulged in considerable speculation. He said this: 

""Of course Mr Redding has given evidence. Mr Redding has denied being at Watsons Bay on that day, or any other day, either with the accused or Caroline Byrne or with anybody. 

However, you should bear in mind this: that at about 3 pm, Mr Jaggard, Mr Michael Jaggard, who was the operator of the Alife restaurant in Stanley Street, East Sydney gave evidence that at about 3 pm he saw the accused arriving at the Alife restaurant with Gary Redding, and the accused spoke to Rene Rivkin who was lunching at the restaurant. Now, I'll come back to that. 

I would also ask you to bear in mind that Gary Redding was the man who was standing shoulder to shoulder with the accused just the previous Friday when the accused was berating Caroline. Gary Redding was also a weight lifter at the time. 

If the accused had attempted to isolate Caroline that day, to provide him with an opportunity to convince Caroline to stay in their relationship, and if he was doing that because of fears that were held by Rene Rivkin about what Caroline and her father knew about him, and if they had - the accused had failed to convince Caroline to stay in the relationship, that would account for why the accused reported back to Rene Rivkin at the Alilfe restaurant about 3 pm and why Rene Rivkin appeared to be agitated and was throwing arms around when he spoke with the accused."" 

328This speculative construction of the events by the prosecutor achieved two things. Firstly, he was hinting at the fact that Redding, who he said was a weight lifter, was the second man who the Crown hypothesised was involved in Ms Byrne's death. Secondly, he related the involvement of Rivkin in the events of that day with the speculative motive which the prosecutor had created. Any proper foundation for that motive was entirely lacking. The Crown prosecutor ultimately tells the jury that they may be unable to say who the second man was on that night. However, ""so long as you are satisfied that the accused was there, that the accused was party to Caroline Byrne being thrown over the Gap, then he is guilty of her murder, whether or not you can decide who the second man was."" 

329The Crown prosecutor's submission identified the difficulty. Even if the applicant was present at the time Ms Byrne died and even if she was thrown over, if there was a second man, the role of the applicant in the events is unknown. Furthermore, if there was a second man there is no evidence of an agreement between the applicant and that person and no understanding of the means which may have been used to bring Ms Byrne to her death. 

330Doherty was first asked to recall the events of this evening in 1998. I have set out his evidence under Ground 2. 

331The prosecutor sought to advance the reliability of Doherty's identification by reminding the jury that his description of what Ms Byrne was doing was said to be similar to that when the accused ""cornered and berated"" and swore at her at the gym. This comparison seems to my mind to be wholly without foundation. In the event described by McVeigh at the gym Ms Byrne is not reported to have said anything. However, at Watsons Bay Doherty identified a woman who was in the gutter sobbing, slurring her words, arguing back and in his view affected by drugs and alcohol. The description of the two incidents have little in common. Furthermore, the autopsy confirmed the absence of evidence of either alcohol or drugs in Ms Byrne's blood. 

332Ultimately, all that Doherty is able to say in relation to the applicant was that after observing him on the ""Witness"" program he thought that he was similar to the person he saw in the street who emerged from under an awning. He does not identify the applicant as that person. 

333The prosecutor sought to explain away Doherty's description of the woman he observed as being affected by drugs or alcohol by saying: 

""Of course, he would, because he had seen numerous people in that area who were drunk or affected by drugs having arguments like that. That of course is likely."" 

334The prosecutor continued: 

""That doesn't mean that that woman was actually drugged or drunk. We submit to you that Caroline Byrne at that stage had been subjected to the most concerted attempt by the accused to convince her to stay in her relationship; they were arguing and arguing and arguing and continued to argue until the time of her death. You might think that she had been so harangued in such a vociferous way by the accused that she was just totally and utterly distressed, not wanting to go, not wanting to be there, wanting to be out of the relationship, not knowing how to cleanly end it, as she told Angelo Georgiou, and that is why she was slurring her words and sobbing."" 

335This submission is almost entirely without foundation. It is a fiction which the prosecutor was not entitled to advance to the jury. The evidence of Doherty was clear that the person he saw was drunk or affected by drugs. There was no evidence that there had been continuous argument during the day or that the source of that argument was that Ms Byrne had on that day said she was to terminate the relationship and the applicant was attempting to convince her to stay. 

336The prosecutor then turned his attention to the applicant's account of the relevant events. He told the jury that ""the Crown case is that the accused told a tissue of lies about where he was during the course of the day."" He raised a number of matters. 

337He referred firstly to the applicant's account to the police of the events at about lunchtime. The applicant told the police that he dropped Rivkin and Richardson at the Alife restaurant and went home to see Ms Byrne, but she was so groggy he left and joined his friends Basquali and Samartis at Ditto's restaurant between 1.15 and 1.45 pm. He said he ordered lunch but left without eating it when telephoned by Rivkin, who asked him to pick up Richardson. 

338The prosecutor criticised this account which he said ""is completely contrary to the evidence of Basquali and Samartis. Basquali says arrangements were made by telephone and it all happened between 12 and 1 pm."" The implication is that the jury should accept Basquali's account of events, including the time, but reject the applicant's. 

339I accept that there are some anomalies in the applicant's account of these events. However, I do not believe that a recollection of the precise time at which any of these events may have happened has great significance. Recalling one's luncheon arrangements and their precise timing based on ordinary human experience presents difficulties. 

340The prosecutor used these times as critical in placing the applicant at Watsons Bay at about 1 pm. I have already expressed my doubt that either Ms Byrne or the applicant were at the Gap at that time. The challenge which the prosecutor made to the applicant's account of the events at about lunchtime does nothing to give weight to the prosecution argument that they were observed in the vicinity at that time. 

341I accept that there are other anomalies. The applicant said he was telephoned by Rivkin and directed to pick up Richardson. The telephone record does not record such a call and Richardson denied lunching with Rivkin on that day. The applicant may have been confused about the sequence of those events and falsely recalled picking up Richardson. Richardson apparently frequently lunched with Rivkin. It may also be that the applicant was lying. However, if he was lying it could only be to avoid a conclusion that he was with Ms Byrne at that time. Given that she did not die until 11.30 pm that night, was known to be suffering depression, and was troubled about her working life, it was entirely plausible that she would be at home and that the applicant would make other arrangements for his lunch. On any view the applicant was with his friends at the restaurant for a relatively short period about lunchtime. If he otherwise lied about his movements at this time I do not believe it has significance for the Crown case. 

342The telephone record shows a call from the applicant to Basquali at 1.18 pm. The prosecutor said this was when the applicant told Basquali he was not coming back to eat the meal he had ordered. It is of course equally possible that this was a call in which the applicant confirmed that he was on his way to the restaurant. Either theory is speculative. 

343The prosecutor next asked the jury to consider the evidence about the applicant and Redding at the Alife restaurant. He accepted that Rivkin dined there on the Wednesday 7 June. Jaggard, who owned the restaurant, said that Rivkin would normally start lunch at 1 pm and that the applicant dropped him off. 

344Jaggard said he saw the applicant and Redding arrive at the restaurant at about 3 pm. The prosecutor did not suggest that this was in any way suspicious but said suspicion arose when Jaggard was later approached three times by the applicant and ""threatened not to say anything about having been seen at the restaurant that day. And also offered a share deal in the UK if he kept quiet."" 

345There is no apparent reason to doubt Jaggard's account. However, nor is there any reason why the applicant would ""cover his tracks"" by seeking to suppress knowledge that he was at the restaurant on that day. The prosecutor extended his submission to include reference to discussion between Redding, Mr George Freris and Jaggard. To my mind, rather than those discussions being relevant to any involvement of the applicant in Ms Byrne's death, they suggest that there may have been other reasons why the relationship between them was fragile. Of course, what the prosecutor was doing was seeking to put into the jury's mind a connection between Rivkin, Redding and the applicant, and the killing of Ms Byrne. There being no reason why the applicant would not want to have been seen with Rivkin at that time on that day, the speculative proposition which the prosecutor was seeking to sustain was untenable. 

346The prosecutor then invited the jury to consider the situation with respect to Richardson. This was said to be an ""alibi"" asserted by the applicant. 

347I accept that there is an inconsistency between the account given to the police by the applicant and the evidence of Richardson. The applicant said that he picked Richardson up at the Alife restaurant at between 2.00 and 2.30 pm and took him to the ACP building or to the Rugby League building. Richardson denies this happened. 

348It may be that the applicant is lying about the issue or is mistaken. To my mind it is of no consequence. The prosecutor says that the applicant lied to create an alibi against it being asserted that he was with Ms Byrne at the Gap during the afternoon. I am not persuaded that beyond the issue of credit this controversy is of any moment. The prosecutor accepted that the applicant was at the Alife restaurant at 3 pm without Ms Byrne. What matters is whether he was with her and caused her death at 11.30 pm. 

349The prosecutor reminded the jury of Jaggard's evidence of threats made to him by the applicant. He said that this was because Jaggard was in a position to ""destroy the Richardson alibi."" However, the prosecutor also proffered that it may have been because it was believed that Jaggard ""had heard his discussion with Rivkin."" 

350By this submission the prosecutor again linked Rivkin to Ms Byrne's death in a manner entirely unsupported by any evidence. Given Richardson's own denial that he lunched with Rivkin it would seem unlikely that the applicant would have threatened Jaggard so as to have him deny that he was at the restaurant with Redding and Richardson. 

351It may be that there was a belief that Jaggard had overheard a conversation which the applicant did not want repeated, but there is nothing to link the threats allegedly made to Jaggard to Ms Byrne's death. 

352The prosecutor's next reference was to the issue of Rohypnol. The applicant told police that he went home and found Ms Byrne asleep and wanting to sleep more. He said that he identified and she confirmed that she had been taking Rohypnol tablets which he had left in the bathroom. Cameron, a friend to whom the applicant spoke about the matter, said that the applicant gave her a further tablet at the time. 

353The autopsy following Ms Byrne's death did not reveal any Rohypnol in her blood stream, although there was evidence in her urine that she had taken it at some time in the recent past. The prosecutor used this evidence to submit, as he was entitled to do, that the applicant had invented his account of Ms Byrne taking Rohypnol to ""enhance his fabricated suicide scenario."" 

354If the account was invented, it does little to add to the possibility that Ms Byrne committed suicide. It is apparent beyond argument that at the time she was depressed. A fabricated story about Rohypnol was hardly necessary to bolster this suggestion. Furthermore, if he had given her another tablet at lunchtime it would be less likely that she would have aroused herself sufficiently to find her way to the Gap and commit suicide. 

355I accept that there are matters which are not adequately resolved and it may be that the applicant fabricated this sequence of events, but I am not persuaded that this issue is of any particular significance to the prosecution case. 

356The prosecutor then turned attention to the applicant's account of the events during the evening. He submitted that the entire sequence of events was fabricated. He drew attention to the following: 

The fact that Ms Byrne's mobile phone was turned off. 

The fact that the applicant, although saying he listened to the messages on the home telephone, did not appear to be aware of a message from Peter Byrne, Ms Byrne's brother. 

The fact that when he woke up, the applicant does not say that he attempted to ring Ms Byrne or attempted to telephone home on any later occasion. 

The fact that the applicant says that he fell asleep and was apparently not wakened by his pager. 

The fact that the applicant's mobile telephone was apparently turned off between about 5.30 pm and 8 pm. 

The different accounts the applicant gave of when he woke up varying between 11 pm and 1 am. 

The fact that Peter Byrne says that he took a call from the applicant at about 12.30 pm which was after the applicant had supposedly found her car at the Gap and had already spent time searching for her. 

357The prosecutor identifies these and other anomalies in the applicant's account. He emphasises them in making the submission that the applicant was in fact with Ms Byrne at the Gap. He further emphasised that it seemed unusual that the applicant would attempt to find Ms Byrne at Bondi or Camp Cove or the Gap on a cold winter's night. Furthermore, although he said he went to the Connaught he did not say that he went into the car park where Ms Byrne usually parked, merely passing outside the building. The prosecutor emphasised the coincidence which the applicant said caused him to look for Ms Byrne at the Gap. 

358The prosecutor also placed emphasis on the applicant's account of his behaviour when searching for Ms Byrne at the Gap. He identified the lack of thoroughness in the search and abandoning it to go to the Connaught to pick up Mr Byrne and Peter, a scenario which the prosecutor described as absurd. He also emphasised that he did not attempt to telephone his home to see whether Ms Byrne had returned. 

359I accept that there are anomalies and inconsistencies in the accounts which the applicant gave of his movements. His account of falling asleep and when waking panicking and going about a search instead of ringing Ms Byrne or her family to find out where she may have been arouses suspicion. However, a suspicion, even a strong suspicion, is not sufficient to make good the prosecution case. 

360The evidence is that when the applicant telephoned Peter Byrne he did not use a mobile phone. The applicant said its battery was flat and he only replaced it early in the morning. Although the prosecutor was inferring that the applicant had for some sinister reason not used his mobile phone I can see no logical reason why this would be. The applicant said that by this time he had been to the Gap, and unless he is in an entirely different location, which was never suggested, he would have had no reason to obscure the fact that he was at the Gap. 

361The prosecutor also emphasised the fact that, although the applicant would have had the option of taking a car owned by Rivkin from the car park which was electronically monitored, he said that he chose instead to walk a further distance and take a vehicle from Rivkin's collection in a car park where there was no electronic monitoring. It was submitted that he did this in order to mask the fact that he had previously taken the vehicle rather than having collected it after he had woken up at home. I accept that the applicant's seeking a car from the more distant car park raises suspicion but there may be other explanations for his actions. 

362The prosecutor then turned his attention to the fact that during the course of the search by the police for Ms Byrne's body the applicant said that he could identify her and recognised the clothes she was wearing. Const Woods said that the applicant said to him that he knew it was Ms Byrne because he knew what clothing she had. He apparently said she had one pair of joggers, four pairs of tights and one denim jacket. He gave a different account of her clothing when interviewed for the Witness program. 

363The prosecutor emphasised the evidence that Ms Byrne had a significant array of clothes, as one would expect of a professional model. It was submitted that the only way the applicant could have known what clothes Ms Byrne was wearing that evening was if he had been with her during the day. There is force in the prosecutor's submission. 

364The prosecutor then turned his attention to the fact that when Ms Byrne's car was searched the police did not find anything of significance in it. However, subsequently the applicant was known to have her mobile phone, her watch (which the evidence was ""she always wore"") and the referral to the psychiatrist. The evidence was that he produced the referral from Ms Byrne's handbag which the prosecutor said was not found by the police when they searched Ms Byrne's car. He also had the two transaction vouchers which evidenced the purchases that Ms Byrne had made that afternoon. 

365There is no evidence as to how the applicant came upon these items. The prosecutor suggested that they must have been in the applicant's possession before Ms Byrne died establishing that he was with her that afternoon. There is no doubt that, at least in respect of the transaction vouchers, it may be significant that they were not found in her car. However, given that Ms Byrne's car was at the Gap and the purse was found in it there is no logical reason why the other items were not ""innocently"" discovered by the applicant. There was no reason for the applicant to have had possession of her watch or, for that matter, the referral to the psychiatrist. If he was intent upon killing her he may have secreted her mobile phone although, as I have indicated, there is an innocuous explanation for her failure to use it that day. 

366Early on the Thursday morning the morgue rang Tony Byrne's apartment and indicated that they had found keys on Ms Byrne's body. The evidence was that this came as a shock to the applicant who proceeded to ""rush out"" to pick them up. The prosecutor submitted that the applicant's shock at Ms Byrne's keys being found was because the applicant had killed Ms Byrne. He said that he stripped her of the items in her possession but missed the keys which explained his surprise when the morgue rang Mr Byrne's apartment. 

367This submission was mere speculation. It is difficult to identify any reason why if the applicant intended to kill Ms Byrne it was necessary to ""strip"" her of any of these items. 

368The prosecutor submitted that over the following days the applicant continued his ""relentless pursuit to try and convince Tony and Peter that Caroline had committed suicide."" He emphasised that on 9 June the applicant had said to Peter and Tony ""she has left a trail. She used her card at Paddington and then she has used her card again at Vaucluse, virtually leaving a trail."" He said that the only way the applicant knew this was because he was in possession of the relevant vouchers and stressed that the withdrawal slip from the bank does not disclose the bank from which the money was obtained. The prosecutor submitted that the only way in which the applicant could have known that the money came from the Westpac bank at Vaucluse was if he had been present with her or had himself made the withdrawal. It was submitted that the knowledge which the applicant had was completely contrary to his assertion that he had not known what Ms Byrne had been doing throughout that day. 

369As the evidence suggests the applicant said that he could establish that Ms Byrne was at Westpac Vaucluse and produced the voucher to establish it, there is at the least an anomaly. The applicant must have known that the voucher did not disclose the branch of the Bank. It would seem likely that he had other reasons for deducing she had obtained money at Vaucluse. 

370The prosecutor then turned his attention to the sequence of events on the Tuesday which he said supported his submission that the appli",2012-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708580,KC v Sanger [2012] NSWSC 98,"Judgment 

1This is an appeal against orders made by his Honour Magistrate McCosker in the Local Court at Forster on 12 May 2011 under s 24 of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 (the Act). On the application of a police officer, the defendant in this Court, it was ordered that a forensic procedure (obtaining a buccal swab and a sample of hair) be carried out in respect of the two plaintiffs. 

2Section 43 of the Act prohibits the publication of the name of a suspect in respect of whom a forensic procedure is sought, or any information likely to enable the identification of that person. Accordingly the plaintiffs and others mentioned in references to the evidence will be identified by way of initials. 

3The appeal is brought pursuant to s 115A(1) of the Act which permits an appeal to this Court under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Under that Part, an appeal is as of right on a ground that involves a question of law alone (s 52(1)). Leave is required in respect of grounds that involve a question of fact or a question of mixed law and fact (s 53(1)). 

Relevant provisions of the Act 

4Whilst the Act has undergone various amendments since it was first enacted in 2000, the following overview of its provisions by Simpson J in Orban v Bayliss [2004] NSWSC 428 remains apposite: 

[30] The Forensic Procedures Act conferred new and unprecedented powers upon, inter alia, magistrates that would have the result of compelling persons suspected of criminal offences (including those against whom charges have not been laid) to cooperate in the investigation of the crime(s) of which they are suspected, and to provide, from their own bodies, evidence which may be used against them (and which, of course, may also be used to exonerate them). The Parliament was, in my view, seeking to maintain a delicate balance between preserving the traditional rights of citizens and individuals, including those suspected of crime, to decline to participate in investigations or to cooperate with investigating authorities, and the overall interests of the community and of justice in facilitating the investigation of crime, and the administration of justice, in securing the conviction of the guilty and the non-prosecution or acquittal of the not guilty. The Act was a specific response to scientific and technological developments, but in the context of valued traditional civil liberties. 

[31] The conditions that must be met before an order can be made demonstrate that the purpose of the legislation is not to enable investigating police (or other authorised persons) to identify a person as a suspect; it is to facilitate the procurement of evidence against a person who already is a suspect. 

[32] A forensic procedure (as defined in s 3) necessarily involves, to a greater or lesser extent, some invasion of the personal privacy and personal bodily integrity of the person concerned. The degree to which that balance to which I have referred will warrant the making of an order that will have the consequence of causing some degree of invasion of personal privacy and personal bodily integrity is made to depend upon the interaction of two things - firstly, the seriousness of the crime of which the person is suspected, and secondly, the degree of invasion of personal privacy or integrity. 

5The application was brought under the provisions of Part 5 of the Act. The provisions that are relevant to the present case may be summarised as follows. 

6Section 23 provides that an order may be made by a magistrate under s 24 for the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect if the suspect is not under arrest and has not consented to the forensic procedure. It was common ground in the proceedings before the magistrate that the plaintiffs had not consented. 

7A ""forensic procedure"" is defined in s 3(1) to include ""a non-intimate forensic procedure"", which in turn is defined to include ""the carrying out on a person of a self-administered buccal swab"" and ""the taking from a person of a sample of the person's hair, other than pubic hair"". 

8A ""suspect"" is defined in s 3(1) to include ""a person whom a police officer suspects on reasonable grounds has committed an offence"". There is an issue about this to which I shall return. 

9Section 24, relevantly, provides: 

24 Final order for carrying out forensic procedure 

(1) A Magistrate may order the carrying out of a forensic procedure if satisfied on the balance of probabilities: 

(a) that the circumstances referred to in subsection (2) or (3) exist, and 

(b) that the carrying out of such a procedure is justified in all the circumstances. 

... 

(3) In the case of a non-intimate forensic procedure: 

(a) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence, and 

(b) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence referred to in paragraph (a). 

(4) In determining whether or not the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances, the Magistrate must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence against the public interest in upholding the suspect's physical integrity, having regard to the following: 

(a) the gravity of the alleged offence, 

(b) the seriousness of the circumstances in which the offence is alleged to have been committed, 

(c) the degree to which the suspect is alleged to have participated in the commission of the offence, 

(d) the age, cultural background and physical and mental health of the suspect, to the extent to which they are known, 

(e) in the case of a suspect who is a child or an incapable person, the best interests of the child or person, 

(f) such other practicable ways of obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence as are less intrusive, 

(g) such reasons as the suspect may have given for refusing to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure concerned, 

(h) in the case of a suspect who is in custody, the period for which the suspect has been in custody and the reasons for any delay in the making of an application for an order under this section, 

(i) such other matters as the Magistrate considers relevant to the balancing of those interests. 

10It can be seen from the foregoing that resolution of the applications brought before the magistrate required consideration of a number of matters: 

(1) Whether the prerequisites in s 23 were established. In this case they were that the plaintiffs were ""not under arrest"" and had ""not consented to the forensic procedure"" (s 23(a)). In other cases they might be that ""the suspect is under arrest and has not consent to the forensic procedure (s 23(b)) or ""the suspect is a child or an incapable person"" (s 23(c)). 

(2) Whether the plaintiffs were ""suspects"" (as defined in s 3), that is: 

(a) they were suspected by a police officer of having committed an offence; and 

(b) there were ""reasonable grounds"" for that suspicion. 

(3) Whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiffs had committed an offence (s 24(3)(a)). 

(4) Whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that he/she had committed the offence (s 24(3)(b)). 

(5) Whether the carrying out of the procedure was justified in all the circumstances (s 24(1)(b)). 

Similar checklists have been usefully provided by Barr J in Jawansher v Johnson LCM [2004] NSWSC 872 at [7] and by Simpson J in Orban v Bayliss , supra, at [37] and FV v Zeitler [2007] NSWSC 333 at [31]. 

The applications 

11The applicant before the Local Court and defendant in this Court was Senior Constable Daniel Sanger of Taree police. The offence he was investigating and which he suspected the plaintiffs had committed was incest, contrary to s 78A of the Crimes Act 1900. To establish that such an offence has been committed it is necessary for there to be proof beyond reasonable doubt that a person had sexual intercourse with a close family member who is of or above the age of 16 years. ""Close family member"" is defined to include a parent and a daughter. The offence has prescribed for it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 8 years. It is an offence which may only be dealt with on indictment. A prosecution for such an offence may only be commenced with the sanction of the Attorney General (s 78F Crimes Act ). 

12Senior Constable Sanger swore affidavits in support of the application in respect of each plaintiff. They were, in part, pro forma. There was another affidavit annexed to the pro forma affidavit. In paragraph 3 of the pro forma it was asserted that; 

""The grounds for believing that the person on whom the procedure is proposed to be carried out is a suspect are: Please see attached Affidavit"". (Emphasis added) 

13Paragraph 4 specified the offence ""which I believe that the person on whom the procedure is proposed to be carried out is suspected of committing"" as incest. (Emphasis added). 

14In paragraph 5 he specified that what was sought was: 

""a non intimate forensic procedure of a buccal swab of the respondent but failing this, the taking of a sample of the respondent's hair, other than pubic hair"". 

15In paragraph 6 he said: 

"" I believe that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed the offence"". 

16The pro forma required him to ""state grounds"", and he inserted that the procedure: 

""will prove that the respondent is the [father/daughter] of co-accused [named] whom [he/she] is alleged to be [creating/bearing] children with"". 

17It was necessary for the applicant to establish that he suspected that the person had committed an offence"" (included in the definition of ""suspect"" in s 3(1)). It was appropriate for him to set out the grounds upon which he based that suspicion. However, whether those grounds were ""reasonable"" was for the magistrate to determine. That was a matter for submissions on the hearing of the application. The officer's assertion that there were ""reasonable grounds"" was not determinative: see, for example, Orban v Bayliss , supra, at [40]; Fawcett v Nimmo [2005] NSWSC 1047; (2005) 156 A Crim R 431 at [20]; FV v Zeitler [2007] NSWSC 333 at [32]. 

18It was also necessary for it to be established to the satisfaction of the magistrate that there were ""reasonable grounds to believe that the [plaintiffs] had committed an offence"" (s 24(3)(a)). The applicant's assertion in his affidavits that there were such ""reasonable grounds"" was not determinative. 

19Further, it was necessary for the magistrate to be satisfied that there were ""reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence"". The applicant's assertion that he believed that there were such reasonable grounds was not determinative. 

20Nothing in the present case turns on these matters. However, I make these observations to draw attention to a risk that the pro forma affidavit used in this case might have a tendency to deflect a magistrate, sitting in a busy Local Court with a heavy case load, from making the determinations that the Act requires. 

Basis for the officer's suspicion 

21The following matters are drawn from Senior Constable Sanger's affidavits, supplemented with evidence he gave before the magistrate. 

22LH was allegedly sexually assaulted by her brother-in-law, AC (the second plaintiff) in the summer of 1968-69. She was then aged 15. There had been previous sexual assaults but none thereafter. In November 1969, LH gave birth to KC (the first plaintiff). 

23The police became involved because of LH's age. It is said that she was frightened of AC and also concerned about a likely fall out with her sister, who was married to AC, if she nominated him as the father of her child. She had not, however, had sexual intercourse with anyone else. During her pregnancy she commenced a relationship with PG. When KC was born she nominated him as the father. PG was charged with carnal knowledge. He pleaded guilty. It is said that this was a result of advice that he would receive a bond and that he would be released on bail for another offence. PG was interviewed by police in 1998 and said that he was not the father of KC and had not been in a sexual relationship with LH prior to her giving birth to KC. 

24When KC was 18 years of age (1987-88), LH told her that her father was AC. 

25LH and KC had a telephone conversation sometime in 1996. KC told LH that she had moved in with AC. They were living on a property on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. LH and KC subsequently argued and had not spoken to each other since. 

26The material in the preceding four paragraphs was said by Senior Constable Sanger in cross-examination to have been ""mostly"" sourced from statements obtained from LH in 2000 and before. The source of the material said to have emanated from PG was an interview of him by police in Queensland in 1998 in connection with ""the initial investigation [of] the alleged sexual assault"" by AC of LH. 

27In the same year that KC moved in to live with AC (1996), AC's second wife, LC was ordered to leave the property. The property is rural and remote. There is said to be a considerable distance from the house to the road. AC remained living on the property with KC who he introduced to ""the family"" (presumably his own family) as his daughter. This material was said by Senior Constable Sanger to have been sourced from conversations he had with LC in December 2010 - January 2011. 

28Also in 1996, KC changed her name on her driver's licence so as to adopt AC's surname. 

29In 2000, LH was told by her niece, TeB, who is also a daughter of AC, that KC had conceived a child with AC. Senior Constable Sanger believed this to be WFC who was born in September 1998. His evidence in cross-examination was that this material was sourced from LH's statements and confirmed in conversations he had with her over the phone. 

30Later in 2000, LH was told by her father TrB that AC had fathered children with KC. 

31In December 2010, an unnamed person reported to the Department of Community Services help line that AC was fathering children with his biological daughter, KC. 

32In January 2011, police spoke with AC's second wife, LC. She told police that she was aware that AC and KC had produced four children who were born in September 1998, 2002, September 2003 and June 2005. LC also told police that KC was currently heavily pregnant. She said that AC denied being the father to these children. Senior Constable Sanger's evidence was that this information provided by LC had been obtained from her two daughters from her relationship with AC: TC and MC. He said that MC was ""quite happy to provide a statement in relation to it"" but that she had not as yet. Police subsequently learned that KC had given birth to a fifth child in December 2010. 

33In January 2011, police spoke with MC. MC told police that KC had been introduced to her as AC's daughter. Until April 2010, she had lived on the property with AC and KC but in a separate residence. At that time, however, she was ordered to leave. She believed that AC and KC wanted to conceal from her and the rest of the family that KC was again pregnant. MC said that there was nobody else frequenting the property at the time who could have fathered the child. 

34MC also told police that she had seen AC and KC kissing passionately whilst intoxicated. 

35Senior Constable Sanger deposed that police had also been told that TC, who is another daughter between AC and LC, that is, a sister to MC's sister, had also seen AC and KC kissing passionately and had seen them in bed together. He did not hear this from TC herself but was told it by LC. 

36Police have obtained copies of the birth certificates in respect of three of the five children. No father is nominated on any of them. 

37Police and officers of the Department of Community Services attended the home of AC and KC on 18 February 2011. AC told them initially that KC was a relative and that she was his carer. Later, after it was alleged to him that he was having an incestuous relationship with KC, he said that they were not related and that he was not the father of her children. He declined to consent to providing a DNA sample. 

38KC told police that a ""Mark Yergon"" was the father of all five of the children. He was said to frequent a nearby town on the mid-north coast. KC maintained that she was not related to AC. She was asked who her father was and she said that she did not know. She conceded that it had been suggested that AC was possibly her biological father. She refused to consent to providing a DNA sample. 

39Senior Constable Sanger noted in his affidavit that AC and KC live with the five children in a two bedroom house. 

40Under the heading ""Grounds to believe that the forensic procedure(s) might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence(s): s 24(1)(a) of the Act"" [sic - s 24(3)(b)], Senior Constable Sanger first noted that, although LH clearly identified AC as the father of KC, there were ""credibility issues"". He claimed that to ascertain whether AC is the father of KC, ""a DNA profile for comparison will confirm if there is the possibility of children being created as a result of an incestuous relationship between [AC and KC]"". 

41Under the heading ""Other matters: s 24(1)(b) of the Act"" [sic - s 24(4)], it was said that during interviews with the four eldest children, Department of Community Services officers had identified mental difficulties which required further professional assessment. KC had not sought any additional assistance in this respect. The children were not undertaking any formal schooling and there had been no compliance with home schooling requirements for over a year. It is also said that Mr Peter Gunn, ""the Manager of the Forensic Biologist"" [sic] with ""extensive experience as a geneticist"" had found during his research that children conceived as a result of parent-child incest are more likely to exhibit signs of intellectual disability than other children. Statistics showed that such children have a one in eight chance of receiving a defective gene compared to a ""rare chance"" in respect of other children. 

42In cross-examination, Senior Constable Sanger confirmed that what was sought was a DNA sample from both AC and KC to compare one with the other. There was no other material against which either could be compared; that is, nothing from LH or from any of the children. After the comparison of AC and KC had been carried out, and assuming it confirmed that they were father and daughter, he would then seek a DNA sample from the mother of LH who had indicated that she would co-operate (I suspect this was a slip and was intended to be a reference to KC's mother, LH). The officer said that he would also then make an application under the Act for a forensic procedure in respect of the eldest child. 

Submissions before the magistrate 

43For the plaintiffs it was submitted in the Local Court that the present case suffered from the same deficiency that was said to have been present in Walker v Budgen [2005] NSWSC 898; (2005) 155 A Crim R 416 . That is, as senior counsel for the plaintiffs put it, ""there was no evidence that DNA had been obtained with which to compare"" the DNA sample sought to be obtained through the forensic procedure. It was asserted that Hall J had ""held that you can't just get DNA on the off chance that some other DNA to be obtained in the future perhaps to compare it with, you have to have something with which to compare it otherwise the Court can't be satisfied of the requirement ... that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence"". In other words, counsel submitted that the requirement in s 24(3)(b) was not satisfied. 

44Reference was made to the fact that the application in respect of KC depended upon the success of the application concerning AC which had not yet been determined, and vice versa. It was also submitted that even if the applications in respect of both were granted, the result of the forensic procedure would only confirm, or disprove, that AC and KC were directly related to one another. It would not tend to confirm, or disprove, that they had committed the offence of incest. 

45Issue was also taken with the requirement that the plaintiffs were ""suspects"". It was submitted that there were no reasonable grounds for the applicant officer's suspicion that the plaintiffs had committed an offence. More significantly, however, it was submitted that his Honour had to be satisfied that there were ""reasonable grounds to believe"" that they had committed an offence. It was put that this requirement could not be satisfied where the material relied upon was ""of the most dubious provenance"". It was noted that the officer had observed that there were ""credibility issues"" in relation to LH. 

46It was submitted that the other source relied upon by the applicant officer, LC, a former wife of AC, should, in effect, be regarded as unreliable second hand hearsay. LC's claim that AC had children with KC was not something about which LC could have any direct knowledge. It was, at best, something that seemed to have been derived from her daughters, MC and TC. 

The decision of the magistrate 

47The magistrate referred to ""information"" emanating from persons directly related to the respondents in the period up to about 2000, particularly the observations of TC and MC of ""interaction"" between the respondents that is ""normal human behaviour for persons in a relationship"". His Honour acknowledged that there may be some aspects of the familial relationships that ""may be either a dysfunctional or even a toxic state of affairs"". Reference was made to the concession by the applicant officer that there may be ""some credibility issues"" in relation to LH. His Honour expressed the view that the officer was mindful that the accounts of LH, and others had the potential for ""embellishment and/or fiction to creep into the information provided"". 

48The magistrate understood the application to be made for the purpose of obtaining DNA profiles, which could be compared to profiles from other individuals, ""to then compare it and assess whether or not the provisions of s 78A of the Crimes Act may have been breached and to do that there is a need for there to be something that this application produces to be compared to or with"". 

49His Honour referred to the objection based upon the authority of Walker v Budgen that at present there was nothing with which to compare the DNA samples sought to be obtained. His Honour was provided with a copy of the judgment of Hall J and read it (he said ""carefully"") and indicated that it was of some assistance. However, he noted that it related to an application to obtain samples with which to compare what was thought might be derived from a crime scene. 

50His Honour then noted that authorities such as the judgment of Hall J must be considered in light of the facts underpinning the application in that case. I take his Honour to have been saying that one must be careful to distinguish statements of principle of general application with statements about the application of principles to the facts of a particular case; the facts of no two cases being identical. 

51The magistrate then distinguished Walker v Budgen from the present case. He referred to it as ""basically a home invasion and theft, this is quite different"". He described the present case as follows: 

""This is said to be a set of circumstances which have occurred over a significant period of time in not only geographical isolation in terms of where the parties were in residence but also in terms of isolation from other members of their family and outside members of the broader community. That then brings into play as I have been directed to the provisions of s 24(4) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 in determining the public interest in these particular matters going forward and the circumstances of whether the application should be granted to allow information to be obtained in circumstances where there is a very serious set of circumstance alleged, a serious crime has been committed."" 

52Aside from ""the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence"", his Honour specifically referred to a number of the other matters in s 24(4) that he was required by s 24(1)(b) to consider: 

""The participation of the parties, well it is quite clear what is said to be the participation of the parties, cultural background et cetera and those matters in (a) through to (f) and then (i) is such other matters as the magistrate considers relevant to balancing those interests."" 

53It is to be noted that the matters specifically omitted from consideration, that is (g) and (h) in s 24(4) were not, in the case of (g) the subject of evidence, or, in the case of (h) applicable. 

54Reference was made to the statement in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 112 that the requirement of a statute that there be ""reasonable grounds"" for a suspicion or belief requires ""the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce the state of mind in a reasonable person"". 

55His Honour returned to the submission that there was an absence of something with which to compare the DNA samples sought from the plaintiffs. He characterised the result of the applications being successful as providing ""hard evidence ... to the prosecution without the hearsay elements"", although he observed that hearsay could be taken into account, subject to an assessment of its weight. In relation to the latter, he repeated that there was the ""potential for this dysfunctional or toxic relationship to exist"", which I take him to mean that there could be an adverse effect upon the weight to be given to the hearsay assertions. 

56Turning specifically to consider the s 24(3)(b) requirement that ""there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence"", his Honour said: 

""You have to come to the view that there is something to compare it with. What would be the outcome of these proceedings, would it be likely to produce evidence which would confirm or disprove that they have committed an offence. Well, on the basis of the lay of the land as it now stands, it would be only able to produce evidence which would indicate in a worse case scenario from the respondents' application and indeed from the applicant's application that they were in fact related. Now there are many standards of relationship. If they are related that may bring into play the matters which are contained in the paragraphs to which I have already referred of [TC] and [MC]. 

Now that is not hearsay evidence because they have - [TC] has indicated also albeit that the evidence has come via potentially a second remove form of hearsay but there is on that evidence available a consideration that there is clear and direct evidence which may in fact link the parties. So there is evidence with which to compare it and that is not for other DNA evidence or other fingerprint evidence but other evidence which is available to the prosecution which may suggest that if there is a familial relationship between the parties and it is suggested that Mr Peter Gunn, the manager of the forensic biologist, I do not know what that means but he is obviously a forensic biologist, that he can determine kinship from DNA. And if that in fact be the case, is it capable of establishing that there may have been an offence committed. Given the relationship that seems to be referred to by the parties, sorry, the relationship which is said to have occurred or activities between the parties as referred to at para 17 of the application [the applicant officer's affidavit where he referred to the claims of AC and KC having been seen kissing passionately], my view is that there is indeed evidence available from these forensic procedures which may tend to prove or disprove that an offence has been committed."" 

His Honour concluded: 

""So in relation to the matter applying my mind to the grounds under s 24(3)(a) must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence, I think in relation to that evidence in para 17 and inclusive not exclusive reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to prove or disprove it, again I would answer that in the affirmative. So in relation to the application for those reasons I believe that there are proper grounds upon which the application should succeed, not on the basis of there being existing DNA with which to compare it but that there are other forms of evidence available to the prosecution which may assist and produce evidence as required under s 24(3)(a) and (3)(b)."" 

Grounds of appeal 

57There are four grounds of appeal set out in the amended summons. I propose to deal with them out of the order in which they were pleaded. 

Ground D: That the Magistrate misdirected himself as to what he was required to find under section 24 of the Act. 

58It was submitted that the magistrate failed to consider, or consider adequately, any of the matters he was required to determine under ss 23 and 24; that is, whether: 

1. the plaintiffs were ""suspects"", 

2. there were reasonable grounds to believe that they had committed an offence, 

3. there were reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that they had committed the offence, and 

4. the procedure was justified in all the circumstances. 

59Whilst it was acknowledged by the learned Crown Advocate that his Honour did not make a specific finding that the plaintiffs were ""suspects"" (as defined in s 3 of the Act), it was submitted that it was implicit in the observations made about whether the offence of incest had been committed that his Honour accepted that they were. In any event, with his Honour having found that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the offence had been committed, it was obvious that his Honour was also of the view that there were reasonable grounds for a suspicion to this effect. 

60In Orban v Bayliss, the magistrate made no express finding that the plaintiff was a suspect. However, Simpson J concluded (at [41]) that, had the magistrate turned her attention to the question, she could not reasonably have formed any view to the contrary. In those circumstances her Honour was not inclined to interfere on that basis. 

61Hall J came to a similar conclusion concerning the failure of the magistrate in Walker v Budgen to make a specific finding concerning what is now the requirement of s 24(3)(a): 

[32] ... The evidence to which I have referred plainly satisfied the provisions of [s 24(3)(a)]. Whether or not it can be demonstrated that the magistrate in fact had specific regard to the provisions of [s 24(3)(a)], there would not, in the circumstances of the present case, be sufficient warrant for this court to interfere on that basis. The magistrate, on the evidence, could not have but been satisfied in terms of [s 24(3)(a)]. 

62It was accepted that the magistrate ""did not refer to every fact that was capable of grounding the required beliefs"" under s 24(3)(a) and (b). However, it was tolerably clear that he was mindful of the requirements of those provisions and specifically ruled that they were satisfied. 

63It was also sufficiently clear that the magistrate was mindful of the provisions of s 24(4) on the question posed by s 24(1)(b) as to whether the carrying out of the procedure was ""justified in all the circumstances"". 

64I accept that to some extent there is a lack of clarity in his Honour's judgment. It is apparent as well that the reasons were not always set out in a logical and sequential fashion. However, it is appropriate to first observe what has been said about the consideration of the reasons for judgment of a magistrate sitting in a busy Local Court. In this case there was an ex tempore judgment delivered immediately upon the conclusion of submissions by counsel and the prosecutor. It is clear that the transcript has not been revised or edited. 

65It was submitted by the Crown Advocate that regard should be had to the practical realities of a Local Court where there is an expectation that prompt and practical judgments will be delivered: L v Lyons; B and S v Lyons [2002] NSWSC 1199; (2002) NSWLR 600 at [59] per Sully J. 

66The caution expressed by Kirby P in Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 478-479 is also apposite. His Honour characterised criticisms of a magistrate's judgment in that case as falling: 

into the error of examining this unedited and unpunctuated record of ex tempore remarks in a busy magistrate's court, as if the transcript were a document to be construed strictly. It is the substance of what the magistrate said and did that the court is concerned with. Any other approach would impose an intolerable burden on magistrates. 

67Similar observations have been made in a number of other cases: see, for example Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 343; (2006) 67 NSWLR 402 at [15] per Johnson J. 

68There are, however, some minimum requirements. In Stoker v Adecco Gemvale Constructions Pty Limited [2004] NSWCA 449, Santow JA observed: 

[41] It is clear that the duty to give reasons is a necessary incident of the judicial process. Without adequate reasons, justice has not been seen to be done, so that failure to give adequate reasons may be an error of law: Pettitt v Dunkley (1971) 1 NSWLR 376; Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 278-279 per McHugh JA; Mifsud v Campbell (1991) 21 NSWLR 725; Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430. But the duty does not require the trial judge to spell out in minute detail every step in the reasoning process or refer to every single piece of evidence. It is sufficient if the reasons adequately reveal the basis of the decision, expressing the specific findings that are critical to the determination of the proceedings. 

69On the hearing of the appeal, Mr Rosser, senior counsel for the plaintiffs, acknowledged these practical considerations but also drew attention to the fact that Sully J had included in his remarks in L v Lyons; B and S v Lyons (at [59]) that: 

None of the foregoing observations, I should perhaps stress, could excuse manifest error of law on the part of a Magistrate. 

70The following may be distilled from his Honour's reasons: 

It was noted that there was evidence of observations of persons who had seen the plaintiffs interacting in a fashion consistent with them being in a sexual relationship. 

Potential credibility issues in relation to the evidence of family members were noted. 

There had been a ""careful"" review of what had been said by Hall J in Walker v Budgen , supra, in which there appears a discussion of the statutory provisions and the need for a magistrate to specifically consider and make findings in relation to each them. 

The magistrate specifically adverted to George v Rockett , supra, as to what is involved when a statute requires there to be reasonable grounds to suspect or believe something. 

There was a stated awareness of the need for the requirements in s 24(3)(a) and (b) and s 24(4) to be satisfied and an indication of being so satisfied. 

In relation to s 24(3)(b), the magistrate referred to there being evidence from which it could be inferred that the plaintiffs were in a sexual relationship. His Honour indicated that he was satisfied that the proposed forensic procedures could produce direct (""hard"") evidence on a matter that was presently the subject of hearsay (that the plaintiffs were father and daughter). He indicated satisfaction that the forensic procedures may produce evidence ""tending to prove or disprove"" the suspected offence had been committed. 

There was mention of the requirement of s 24(4) for there to be a balancing of two competing public interests. The magistrate referred to the requirement of the subsection that he have regard to certain matters as well as ""such other matters as"" he considered relevant to the balancing of those interests. 

71I accept the submission that there was a failure of the magistrate to articulate a finding that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion held by the applicant officer. It might be inferred that his Honour turned his mind to this issue by his reference to what is required for there to be reasonable grounds to suspect something, but there is nothing I can distill from the judgment that indicates that a specific finding was made. 

72However, a failure in this respect could not warrant the interference of this Court. It is clear enough in my view that the magistrate was satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiffs had committed an offence (s 24(3)(a)). Such a finding subsumes a finding that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion of the applicant officer. 

73It is also clear enough, in my view, that the his Honour considered and was satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the plaintiffs had committed the offence (s 24(3)(b)). 

74As to the submission that there was a failure to ""consider, or consider adequately,"" whether the carrying out of the proposed forensic procedures was justified in all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the magistrate was aware of the requirement to consider the balancing exercise mandated by s 24(4) and was mindful of the various matters he was required to take into account. He specifically mentioned some of those matters: the seriousness of the suspected offence and the alleged participation in it of the plaintiffs. It is notable that of the other matters listed in the subsection, there was no suggestion in either the Local Court or this Court that any of them were of any significance. Further, there was no suggestion in either Court of there being any other relevant matter that required consideration (s 24(4)(i) - ""such other matters as the Magistrate considers relevant""). 

75I am not persuaded that the magistrate misdirected himself as Ground D asserts. 

Ground C: The Magistrate was in error in failing to consider and deal with the application against each Plaintiff independently of the application of the Defendant against the other Plaintiff. 

76The submission in support of this ground was that each plaintiff was entitled to have the application against him/her considered individually. Doing so would have indicated that there was nothing at all to compare with the DNA sought to be obtained. In other words, the contention was that in dealing with the application in respect of one plaintiff, the magistrate should have ignored the fact that he was dealing simultaneously with an application concerning the other plaintiff. 

77The Crown Advocate referred to the fact that at the outset of the hearing in the Local Court, senior counsel for the plaintiffs advised his Honour that there was no objection to the applications proceeding together. Further, it was contended that there was no error in the magistrate proceeding on the basis that if one application was to be granted, the other should be as well because the applicant relied upon identical evidence in relation to each. 

78This ground was only faintly pressed at the hearing. In my view the submissions for the defendant should be accepted. It would have been unrealistic for the magistrate to have put completely out of his mind one application when he was determining the other. It was obvious that the purpose of the applications being made was to enable a comparison of DNA samples obtained from each of the plaintiffs. There was nothing erroneous in the magistrate considering and determining both applications simultaneously and with regard to each other. 

Ground A: That the Magistrate was in error in finding that the evidence was sufficient in law to sustain a finding that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Plaintiffs had committed an offence as required by section 24(3)(a) of 'the Act'. 

79In oral submissions, senior counsel for the plaintiffs clarified that what was intended to be conveyed in the statement of this ground (and ground B) by ""sufficient in law"" was that the evidence was incapable, on any view, of establishing the required matter. 

80It was submitted that the magistrate erred in not directing his mind to the question of whether there were reasonable grounds for Senior Constable Sanger's suspicion that the plaintiffs had committed the offence of incest. I have dealt with that submission under Ground D. 

81Mr Rosser accepted that hearsay material may provide a basis for the belief but it ""must have some probative value"". Reference was made to R v Rondo [2001] NSWCCA 540; (2001) 126 A Crim R at [53] where Smart AJ said, in speaking of a reasonable suspicion that it ""may be based on hearsay material or materials which may be inadmissible in evidence"" but added that ""the materials must have some probative value"". 

82In this case, the hearsay material was ""for the most part, second-hand or even more remote hearsay. It has little probative value even in the context of belief"". So, it was submitted that the evidence fell short of establishing reasonable grounds for the belief. 

83The Crown Advocate submitted that this ground, and ground B, raise a mixed question of fact and law: R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; (2009) 199 A Crim R 199 at [11] - [27] per Spigelman CJ. The process of determining whether evidence was sufficient to establish the matters in both s 24(3)(a) and (b) required the magistrate to apply legal standards to facts that he found. That submission is undoubtedly correct. An appeal on a ground that involves a question of mixed law and fact may be permitted by leave: s 53(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . The defendant did not oppose leave being granted, given that leave is not required in relation to grounds C and D. An extension of time to further amend the summons to incorporate an application for leave was also not opposed. 

84It was submitted that the evidence before the magistrate was sufficient to establish that there were reasonable grounds to suspect, and believe, that KC was the daughter of AC. There was, at least, the direct evidence of LH that AC was the father of KC. 

85There was also sufficient evidence to establish that AC was the father of KC's children. It was accepted that this involved some hearsay but not entirely. There was the direct evidence of the living arrangements and the geographical isolation of the plaintiffs and the children, all of whom were born after KC commenced cohabitation with AC. These were matters to which the magistrate made specific reference. Reference was also made to the evidence available from MC that she had seen AC and KC kissing passionately and that up until she was forced to leave the property in April 2010, no one had been frequenting the property who could have fathered the fifth child. 

86There was evidence which tended to the opposite conclusion, that is that AC was not the children's father. There were the subsequent denials to the police, contrary to earlier admissions, that they were related and KC claimed that a ""Mark Yergon"" was the father. It was submitted that it was not fatal to the conclusion reached by the magistrate that there was this opposing body of evidence. Reference was made to George v Rockett , supra, at 116: 

The objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something need to point more clearly to the subject matter of the belief, but that is not to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the balance of probabilities that the subject matter in fact occurred or exists: the assent of belief is given on more slender evidence than proof. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of the mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture. 

87Contrary to the submission for the plaintiffs, it was contended that the magistrate's reasons indicated that it was not merely in the final paragraph of his Honour's judgment that I have extracted above (at [56]) that he addressed the issue raised by s 24(3)(a). It was submitted that his Honour's reasons as a whole indicated that he was mindful of the statutory requirements from the outset. 

88I accept that the evidence of the applicant officer included a lot of hearsay, some of it being second hand or even more remote. However, it also included that there was evidence available for any potential prosecution as to the following matters. 

AC was the father of KC (according to the direct evidence of LH). 

KC changed her name so as to adopt AC's surname at around the time she moved in to live with him in 1996 (this may be indicative of non-related people commencing a relationship, but could be regarded as more indicative of an acknowledgement by KC that she was AC's daughter). 

There was a denial made to police by KC that AC was her father, but she conceded that it had been suggested that he possibly was. 

There was, initially, an admission made to police by AC that KC was related to him although he later retracted it when the allegation was put to him that they were living in an incestuous relationship. 

Although both AC and KC denied that he was the father of her five children: 


the five children were all born whilst KC was living with AC; 

they lived on a remote property; 

they lived in a two bedroom house with the five children; 

they had been seen kissing passionately; 

MC had been ordered off the property soon after the fifth child was conceived (supporting an inference that there was a desire to conceal the pregnancy from her); 

MC's observations were that no-one had frequented the property around the time of the fifth child's conception; and 

birth certificates for three of the children had no father nominated (supporting an inference that there was a desire to conceal the father's true identity out of consciousness of guilt). 

89Having regard to all of these matters, not individually but collectively, I am of the view that it was well established by the evidence before the Local Court that there were reasonable grounds for the applicant officer's suspicion that the offence of incest had been committed and that there were reasonable grounds to believe the same. 

90The magistrate's conclusion that the requirement of s 24(3)(a) was satisfied, which I have indicated in relation to Ground D that I am satisfied that he reached, was one that was well open to him. Ground A has not been established. 

Ground B: The Magistrate was in error in finding that the evidence was sufficient in law to sustain a finding that there were reasonable grounds to believe that a forensic procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the Plaintiffs had committed an offence as required section 24(3)(b). 

91It was submitted that the magistrate failed to ""articulate the basis upon which he purports to find paragraph 3(b) satisfied beyond the statement 'You have to come to the view that there is something to compare it with'"". 

92It appeared that the magistrate was of the view that the DNA evidence obtained might be compared with evidence of the asserted observations of witnesses and thus be of forensic significance. In this regard, reference was made to the penultimate extract from the judgment which I have set out above (at [56]). 

93It was submitted that s 24(3)(b) required that the material to be obtained must have been ""evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed [an] offence"". In this case, the material would establish no more than a relationship between the plaintiffs. It would not render more or less probable the fact of sexual intercourse between them. The provision did not permit the compulsory gathering of evidence for general investigative purposes. 

94To establish that sexual intercourse had occurred would require the further step of an application being made to the Local Court for the carrying out a forensic procedure to obtain a DNA sample from at least one of the children. It was submitted that there was no certainty that any such application would be granted. Much as was the case in Walker v Budgen it was submitted that it was a matter of speculation whether there would be any DNA sample available in order to determine the parenthood of any of the children. 

95It was also submitted that obtaining DNA samples to determine whether AC was the father of KC, could not, in any event, have a tendency to confirm or disprove the suspected offence because there was already evidence available in relation to that issue. In other words, the comparison of DNA samples from the plaintiffs would add nothing to what the police already had. 

96So, it was submitted that ""it was not open to the magistrate, as a matter of law, to be satisfied with respect to paragraph (3)(b)"". 

97It was acknowledged by the Crown Advocate that DNA samples from the plaintiffs would not definitively prove whether an offence had been committed. They would, however, confirm or disprove a primary element of the suspected offence, that is, whether there existed between the plaintiffs a ""close family relationship"" of parent and daughter. 

98It was submitted that s 24(3)(b) did not require a finding that the proposed forensic procedure would produce evidence that ""must"" or ""will"" confirm or disprove that a suspect committed an offence. Rather, it provided a lower threshold that the evidence ""tends"" to do the same. This is a matter that the magistrate addressed in his statement that ""it would be only able to produce evidence ... that they were in fact related"". 

99It was also submitted that his Honour was correct to distinguish the factual matrix underpinning the judgment of Hall J in Walker v Budgen , supra. In the present case there was no room for speculation at all. Even if there was no certainty that an application for a forensic procedure to obtain a DNA sample from one or more of the children would be granted, there was certainty that there could be a comparison of the DNA samples obtained from each of the plaintiffs. If comparison of those samples yielded the result that the applicant officer suspected, that would add weight to a future application that might be made in relation to one or more of the children. 

100In my view, ""tending to confirm or disprove"" in s 24(3)(b) should not be construed as requiring that the evidence be capable of establishing the suspected offence by itself. It is difficult to envisage a case in which every element of an offence could be proved by DNA evidence. For example, in a murder case, DNA might establish a suspect's presence at the scene, but it would say nothing about his or her state of mind at the time of the killing. In a sexual assault case it might establish the identity of the perpetrator but it would say nothing about whether he or she knew that the complainant was not consenting. In such cases, the DNA evidence could ""[tend] to confirm or disprove that the suspect ... committed the offence"" without providing (in the case of ""confirm"") complete proof that he or she did so. 

101It is obvious that the evidence sought to be produced from the forensic procedure in the present case had the potential to prove one of the two elements of the suspected offence. It had the additional potential of aiding proof of the other element, subject to the police being able to obtain further DNA samples. The first of those two matters was sufficient for the success of the application. 

102The fact that the police already had some evidence concerning the relationship between the plaintiffs did not mandate refusal of the application. As the magistrate was expressly aware, the existing evidence might not have been capable of satisfying a tribunal of fact beyond reasonable doubt on the issue. The evidence sought had the potential to do so. 

103The conclusion of the magistrate that the requirement of s 24(3)(b) was satisfied was one that was well open to him. 

Conclusion 

104None of the grounds of appeal have been established and so the appeal will be dismissed. 

105Even if it had been demonstrated that any of the errors or misdirections asserted were made out, I would not be inclined to intervene. Mr Rosser conceded that if I came to the view that the evidence before the magistrate nonetheless justified the conclusion that his Honour reached then the appeal should be dismissed. Such an approach was adopted by Hall J in Walker v Budgen , supra (at [32]) and by Barr J in Jawansher v Johnson LCM [2004] NSWSC 872 at [17]. I am of that view. 

106There was no suggestion that costs should not follow the event and so I propose to make the usual order. I will, however, leave open the opportunity for the plaintiffs to be heard on this issue if they wish. 

107There is a need to vary the orders of the magistrate in terms of when the plaintiffs are to present themselves for the carrying out of the forensic procedure. Power to vary is to be found in s 55(2) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . 

108Submissions were made about the magistrate having ordered that both types of forensic procedure be carried out when they had only been sought in the alternative. There was no ground of appeal in relation to this. The Crown Advocate clarified that it was proposed that only one be carried out. It was intended that the taking of a hair sample would only be carried out in the event that there was some difficulty in the plaintiffs participating in a self-administered buccal swab procedure. I will make a slight variation to the magistrate's orders by substituting ""or"" for ""and"" upon that understanding. 

Orders 

1. Leave to extend time to amend summons and to appeal in relation to Grounds A and B granted. 

2. The appeal is dismissed. 

3. The orders of the magistrate in relation to each plaintiff are varied. The plaintiffs are to provide a buccal swab or a sample of hair (other than pubic hair) at the Forster Police Station on or before noon on Friday 9 March 2012. 

4. The plaintiffs are to pay the defendant's costs. 

5. Liberty to apply within 7 days if any alternative order as to costs is sought.

2708588,R v Craig McGREGOR [2012] NSWDC 265,"SENTENCE


1Craig McGregor was a man who already had convictions for drug offences. Not long after he finished his parole for earlier offences he got involved in an agreement with other people to manufacture methylamphetamine. Over a similar period whilst he was at home where the manufacturing occurred, he accessed child pornography on his computer. As a result of that activity he has been charged with two serious crimes. 

2The first is conspiracy to manufacture a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine. That is an offence under s 24(2) and s 26 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to that crime. 

3The second was possessing child pornography. That is made into a crime by s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed to that crime a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. 

4So it can be seen that Mr McGregor has got himself involved in two very serious offences. 

5He was arrested on 29 April 2009 and his sentence will date from then. 

6It is important for a judge to set out briefly what happened which gave rise to the offences that a criminal has been charged with and convicted of, so that some assessment can be made of how serious examples of the particular crime the offences were. 

7In a judgment I delivered on 5 December 2011, I found Craig McGregor not guilty of conspiracy to manufacture a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. He had pleaded guilty before the trial - which was before me sitting alone - to the conspiracy to manufacture an indictable quantity of the same drug, which is the offence that I am sentencing him for now. In that judgment I gave a description of what he had been doing. 

8He was engaged with two other people in a process of manufacturing methylamphetamine. This process occurred in Mr McGregor's unit. He was not only manufacturing methylamphetamine, a prohibited drug, but was engaged also in manufacturing other kinds of substances which were not illegal. When the police came to his unit and arrested him they found a large amount of chemical equipment and solutions and in fact one chemical process was under way when the police arrived. It itself was not an illegal process. It was a fairly chaotic scene and was like an amateur laboratory. 

9When the police arrived they also got access to Mr McGregor's computer in his unit on the northern beaches. Some time later during an analysis of the contents of the computer they found child pornography images. They found 963 images of child pornography and a number of movie files depicting child pornography. The combined number of images and movie files was just over 1,000. 

10There is a scale used to assess the seriousness of child pornography. It is called the COPINE scale. Level 1 is the least serious and depicts non-erotic sexualised pictures. The most serious category is level 10 and depicts sadistic images or images of bestiality or sexual images involving pain or animals. 

11The files found on Mr McGregor's computer ranged over all categories. 

12Amongst the 963 images found were images of children clothed and positioned in erotic poses and images of naked children. In addition there were images and movies of children performing sexual acts on other children and on adults, and images and movies of children being sexually assaulted by adults. Finally, there was included the most serious category of images of a child being sexually assaulted and in pain. The video files included the most serious category again of children being sexually assaulted and in pain, as well as being sexually assaulted by adults using foreign objects, causing pain and bleeding. There was footage of children engaged in self and mutual masturbation with other children and adults, and footage of children performing sexual acts on children and adults. 

13They are brief descriptions of the two crimes that I am sentencing Mr McGregor for. 

14It is also obviously important for a judge to take into account whether an offender has any previous record, particularly for the same or similar offences. Mr McGregor has no previous record for any offence involving child pornography but he has a record of some significance in respect of drugs. He has been convicted of possessing a prohibited import as well as possessing a commercial quantity of a prohibited import, as well as a prohibited drug. His effective sentence for those crimes, which was finally settled by the Court of Criminal Appeal, was some 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. Those offences were committed in 1999 and in the same year he committed an offence of supplying a prohibited drug and received a concurrent sentence of some 6 months. 

15A judge also has to take into account information and evidence which is personal to an offender. In this case Mr McGregor's solicitor, Ms Catherine Hunter, obtained a report from a clinical psychologist, Michelle Player, and Mr Jason Watts of counsel who appeared for Mr McGregor tendered it in evidence. It was dated 6 February 2012. It contained a good deal of personal information about Mr McGregor. 

16Of significance is the fact that he started smoking cannabis when he was 15 and by the time he was 18 he was smoking every day. He was also taking LSD on a weekly basis until he was 19. He then started using ecstasy tablets. He abstained for a couple of years from 1996 to 1998 but then recommenced and started using ecstasy on an almost daily basis around the time he was committing the earlier offences on his record. After his earlier prison sentence he resumed using ecstasy on a fortnightly basis. He was also using another legal drug but said that he did not use other drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine or heroin. In 2008 he commenced smoking methylamphetamine, which is also known as Ice. That was in some way connected with his then partner going to gaol.

17He claimed that he developed drug-induced psychotic symptoms of a delusional nature from his daily use of methylamphetamine. His delusions included inventing a drug which would save the world. He thought it would be a miracle drug which would stop people doing bad things. He envisaged that the profits would go to a charity. He thought he was receiving special messages from the television or the radio. He explained to the psychologist that his possession of child pornography was in the context of his belief ""that if he could understand the pornography, he would be able to change the world and cease such activity occurring"". Ms Player said that both of Mr McGregor's offences: ""seem best understood in the context of his drug-induced psychosis at the time as a result of daily amphetamine abuse"". He told her that he was horrified by the fact that he had been charged with child pornography offences. The psychologist thought that his mental health problems met the criteria for an amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder with delusions. 

18Mr McGregor has been in custody for over 2 years since his arrest. He told the psychologist that it has taken nearly all of that time of being drug free in custody for his delusional thinking to fully resolve. She thought that that recovery period: ""suggests that he has an underlying vulnerability to developing a psychotic type illness"". 

19Ms Player made an assessment of Mr McGregor's risk of re-offending and concluded on balance that there was a low risk of him re-offending so far as sexual recidivism is concerned. She said also that that offending, namely the child pornography ""seems best understood in the context of his delusional belief that he could cease child pornography around the world if he could gain an understanding of this material"". The fact that he has been drug free both in the community and in custody, Ms Player thought, ""indicates that Mr McGregor is capable of achieving long-term drug abstinence, provided he is suitably motivated and he refrains from re-establishing ties with his prior drug-using peer group"". She thought that Mr McGregor's: ""main recidivism risk is that he will relapse into drug use upon his release from custody"". She recommended that he engage in certain programmes whilst he is in custody and that his: ""main treatment needs will be upon his release in the community when his motivation to abstain from drugs will be significantly tested"". She made certain recommendations which are contained in paragraph 37 of her helpful report. 

20Mr McGregor himself wrote a letter of explanation to me, which became exhibit S2. He explained his involvement in drugs and the choices which he had made and the effect which a drug-free existence whilst in custody has had on him. He finds that he is once again a ""reasonably high-functioning individual"" who is no longer addled by drugs. He has had the opportunity to take drugs in custody but has declined those opportunities. He is looking to other things such as his fitness and artistic endeavours. He is looking forward to undertaking further rehabilitation when he is in the community and is determined to undertake that process. 

21It seems that there is some lack of clarity in the custody records about whether or not Mr McGregor was on parole when he committed these offences. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was on parole. Mr M Barr of counsel who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions did not press a submission to that effect but both he and Mr Watts acknowledged that the offences were committed within a period of some months, perhaps about 6 months, of Mr McGregor's final release on parole. 

22It is in these circumstances that I come to sentence Mr McGregor. I have been greatly assisted by submissions from both Mr Barr and Mr Watts. 

23I should say that there was one witness called in the sentence proceedings. Mr David Owen is the partner of Mr McGregor's mother. He has known Mr McGregor for the last 18 years. He was fairly guarded in his evidence but made it clear that he and Mr McGregor's mother were prepared to support Mr McGregor in his efforts for rehabilitation once he is released into the community and those efforts would extend to some financial support in getting Mr McGregor re-established in accommodation and counselling. 

24I will express some conclusions about some of the submissions which were put to me. 

25Of marginal relevance is the fact that the drug offences were capable of being disposed of summarily. Mr Watts did not suggest that it was a matter of great significance, and I accept his submission. It is significant but only, as I said, in a marginal sense.

26Mr Barr argued that the condition of the unit being, as I said, an amateur laboratory with processes under way was an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 because it demonstrated that the offence was committed ""without regard for public safety"". I do not accept that submission as a submission that it is a specific factor which should aggravate the offence under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I do put some weight on the fact that the condition of the unit was chaotic and that it would obviously have the potential for some risk to innocent persons but I do not elevate it to an aggravating factor. 

27I do accept that the drug offence was aggravated by involving a series of criminal acts under s 21A(2)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There were other chemical processes which Mr McGregor was undertaking at the same time which were not criminal but he was attempting to manufacture methylamphetamine using two different, well-known and illegal methods of engaging in that process. 

28I accept that I can put some weight on the fact, as Mr Watts said, that his client, who is now 37, has more insight and maturity, which is confirmed by his client's letter. 

29There is some remorse but not a lot. I accept that there is, so far as s 21A(3)(i) is concerned, some evidence of remorse but it is expressed to the psychologist and was not expressed to me in the witness box so far as the child pornography was concerned. I think there is room for more weight on remorse so far as the drug offences were concerned. 

30Mr McGregor has pleaded guilty to both offences. It is accepted by the prosecutor that the plea to the child pornography offence was at the earliest available opportunity, and I will make an allowance in due course of 25 per cent. In other words, I will discount the sentence which I would otherwise have imposed for the child pornography offence by 25 per cent because Mr McGregor has saved the resources of the State a good deal by indicating his guilt for that crime and avoiding a prosecution. 

31I accept Mr Watts' submission that the appropriate discount in respect of the drug offence should be in the order of 20 per cent. It was not a plea which was entered, as Mr Watts acknowledged, at the very earliest available opportunity but on 7 November 2010, about a year before the trial, Mr McGregor asked the prosecution to consider accepting a plea of guilty to the offence that I eventually found him guilty of and that offer was not accepted.

32As I said, a significant aggravating feature is his criminal record so far as the drug offence is concerned. 

33I accept Mr Watts' submission that s 91H of the Crimes Act dealing with the child pornography offences covers a wide range of conduct. This is a case of possession. It is not a case of dissemination of child pornography material. 

34Both Mr Watts and Mr Barr drew my attention to the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision in R v Dennison [2011] NSWCCA 114. Schmidt J, with whom Whealy and McCallum JJ agreed, reviewed the authorities on assessing the seriousness of child pornography. Her Honour referred to the recent decision of that court in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; (2010) 201 A Crim R 243 and extracted at [71] of her Honour's judgment in Dennison is a quotation from [94] of Hulme J's judgment in Minehan. 

35There are a number of factors which Mr Watts draws my attention to because it is not possible to determine some of those factors unfavourably to his client beyond reasonable doubt. One of the factors which is relevant to assessing the seriousness of this crime is the age of the children. As Mr Watts says, in this case that is neutral because I have no information about the ages of the children. We do not know whether most of them were under 10 or close to 17. I do not say that to indicate that child pornography involving a 17 year old is more acceptable. I say it because obviously it is an even graver offence to commit such an offence which involves an infant. Both crimes are deplorable; one is even more deplorable than the other. 

36Another factor is the number of different children who are involved. Once again, we do not know the number of different children who are involved and that factor must remain neutral. 

37Another factor is the offender's purpose in accessing the child pornography. On the one hand it could be for their own use. On the other hand it could be for sale or sending to other people. This is important in this case because there is no evidence that Mr McGregor was selling this material or passing it on to anyone else. Indeed what he seemed to be doing in his drug-induced psychotic state was accessing it himself in order to further his delusional purpose. 

38I should add, referring briefly again to Ms Player's report, that I accept the contents of her report. There is no evidence challenging it. 

39I accept Mr Watts' submission that Mr McGregor's mental health is a relevant condition. The psychologist has diagnosed a very serious mental health problem. His delusional state was very relevant to his purpose in accessing the child pornography and that in turn will reduce the culpability or objective seriousness of the offence. It also means that general deterrence is moderated somewhat. 

40I place a little less weight on that factor so far as the drug offences were concerned because the taking of illegal drugs itself brought him into that milieu and he was committing offences which were related to illegal drugs. But I do put some weight on that factor for the drug offences but less than for the child pornography offence. 

41I accept that he is at low risk of re-offending so far as the child pornography offences are concerned but that there is obviously some risk so far as the drug offences are concerned. 

42Mr Watts helpfully referred me to the judgment of Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 on the question of accumulation or concurrency. His Honour set out the relevant principle at [27] of that judgment. I have determined that the overall sentence which I will impose shortly will cover the total criminality. There will be some accumulation and some concurrency. 

43Mr Watts urged me to find that there are special circumstances for disturbing the normal ratio between a non-parole period for a sentence and the full term. The standard relationship is that a non-parole period will be 75 per cent of the full sentence. It can be reduced from that 75 per cent if there are special circumstances. In this case Mr Watts argued that he needs the support in the community for his continuing recovery from drug addiction. On the other hand, he has been sentenced before for drug crimes. He has been drug free before and has relapsed and he committed these crimes within a relatively short period of the termination of his parole for previous drug offending. 

44I propose to reduce the standard ratio to about 70 per cent in those circumstances. 

45I do take into account Mr Watts' submission that the quantity of drugs which have been proved to have been manufactured by Mr McGregor was fairly low. 

46I turn now to considering the sentences. I will consider the sentence first for the child pornography offence. 

47Taking into account the various matters which I have referred to, including a good number of mitigating factors, I would regard an appropriate overall sentence for the crime committed against s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act as being 2 years imprisonment. Because Mr McGregor has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity, I will reduce that sentence by 25 per cent. So his sentence for that crime will be 18 months imprisonment. 

48I regard an appropriate sentence for the conspiracy to manufacture methylamphetamine as 6 years imprisonment. I will discount that - because of a slightly belated plea of guilty - by 20 per cent. So the sentence for the drug offence will be 4 years and 9 months imprisonment. 

49The sentence for the child pornography offence will commence from the date when Mr McGregor was arrested, namely 29 April 2009. I will impose it as a fixed term for two reasons; one, it has already expired, and the second reason is that it is partly subsumed in the sentence for the other crime. That 18months penalty expired on 28 October 2010. 

50The sentence of 4 years and 9 months for the drug conspiracy will commence a year after the commencement of the child pornography offence, namely on 29 April 2010. It will expire on 28 January 2015. 

51For the reasons that I have said, I will set a non-parole period of 3 years. That will commence on 29 April 2010 and will expire on 28 April next year, 28 April 2013. The balance of the term will be 1 year and 9 months commencing 29 April 2013 and expiring on 28 April 2015. 

52The overall effective sentence which I am imposing is 5 years and 9 months. It commenced on 29 April 2009 and expires on 28 April 2015. The effective non-parole period is 4 years commencing 29 April 2009 and expiring 28 April 2013. 

53So Mr McGregor, they are the sentences which I impose upon you. I will explain them a bit more in a moment. The first date upon which it appears to me that you are eligible for parole is 28 April 2013 and that is a matter for the parole authority, not for me. 

HIS HONOUR: Two things, Mr Coles and Mr Kiely. One is whether I've made any factual or legal errors which can be corrected now. The second thing is the mathematics. Mr Kiely, there's one thing for you. Judges are told that it is of assistance to the Corrective Services department when an offender goes into custody for there to be sent to the Corrective Services section which deals with classification any psychological material and I have in mind that Ms Player's report, which I have a clean copy of as the exhibit, may well be one that I would send but I would do so only with your instructions to do so. 

KIELY: Mr McGregor instructs me that he had previously received some advice from his barrister that that not take place. 

HIS HONOUR: That not be done? 

KIELY: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: That's fine. I won't do it. 

KIELY: Thank you, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. 

COLES: Your Honour, so far as the two questions are concerned, I've read your Honour's decision on verdict and what's flowed from your Honour today seems to be consistent with that. 

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. 

COLES: Secondly, in relation to the mathematics, that seems to be correct, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: All right, thanks, Mr Coles. What about-- 

KIELY: Nothing from me, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay. 

54So Mr McGregor, two sentences. The child pornography, you have got 18 months. It would have been 2years but you pleaded guilty. That started when you were arrested, 29 April 2009, and expired on 28 October 2010. That has finished.

55The drug conspiracy sentence started a year after that one. It started on 29 April 2010. There has to be some, as we say, accumulation. So you have got to serve time separately for the child pornography offence. The overall sentence for the drug conspiracy is 4 years and 9 months, so that finally ends on 28 April 2015. Your non-parole period is of 3 years and that commenced on 29 April 2010 and will expire on, as I said, 28 April 2013, which is the first date it seems to me you are eligible for parole, subject to the Parole Authority, but you know the process there. 

56The balance of that sentence is 1 year and 9 months commencing 29 April 2013 and concluding 28 April 2015. Your effective sentence overall was 5 years and 9 months. Your effective non-parole period is 4 years, which is about 70 per cent instead of the 75 per cent. 

KIELY: Just in relation to the finishing date for the balance of term, your Honour said it was 28 April 2015. 

HIS HONOUR: I'm wrong. It should be 28 January. I'm sorry. Thank you. 

57The sentence for the drug conspiracy, 29 April 2010 to 28 January 2015. The balance of the term starts after the non-parole period on 29 April 2013 and finishes on 28 January 2015. So your overall sentence expires on 28 January 2015. You are eligible for parole on 28 April next year. 

58Okay, Mr McGregor, you have heard what I said. It sounds as though you have made a good start on your recovery in custody. And so good luck.

2708593,R v BRANNIGAN [2012] NSWDC 23,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Bradley James Brannigan became involved in drugs. He started using them socially, but then began to use them more and more often as a means of relaxing. He developed a bit of a habit. He was able to give it up at some stage but began using again. He had a friend called Spalaviero. Although when he first met him he did not realise that Brad Spalaviero was a drug dealer, he worked that out. He nevertheless remains friends with him. One evening he discussed with Mr Spalaviero and another man called Zachary Russell a drug deal that was going to take place the following day in Warriewood. He agreed to participate in that drug deal. One of his functions was to attest to the purity of the drugs to the purchaser. He was to say to the purchaser that the cocaine was eighty per cent pure. 

2Many references have been tendered by family, friends, and work colleagues of the offender. They all seem to be based on the assumption that that was the limit of the offender's involvement, that is his involvement was limited to attesting to the purity of the drugs. Those references are all based on a false premise. The offender did more than that. He became more involved in the drug transaction than the referees seem to believe. 

3The offender provided transport to Mr Spalaviero. They went to the location where the drug supply was to take place in the offender's ute. He well knew that a significant quantity of cocaine was involved. He saw the cocaine in a wrapped form. He was able to work out how much was involved from the size of the package. He accompanied Mr Spalaviero throughout the drug supply transaction which occurred the following day. Mr Russell hid the drugs in the toilet. This offender and Spalaviero were told that that had been done and then went into the café where they met a man known to Spalaviero. The supply of six ounces of cocaine was discussed for an agreed value of $51,000. It was at that stage that the offender told the male the cocaine was about eighty per cent pure, but the offender's involvement did not cease. After this discussion the purchaser told the offender and Spalaviero that the money was in his car. Spalaviero asked the purchaser to give the money to Russell. The purchaser got the cocaine from the toilet and it was at this stage that the offender and Spalaviero left the café and approached Russell. It was the offender who told him that the money would be coming from the purchaser. So, the offender got much more involved in this transaction than his referees understood to be the case. 

4A short time later they were all arrested. The offender was taken back to the police station where he made immediate admissions as to what he had done. The drugs were seized. It was discovered that there was 167.4 grams of cocaine in a package. It has a purity of about forty-two per cent. The estimated street value I am told is about $72,000, not too far different from the purchase price that had apparently been agreed.

5The offender has no prior criminal history, although of course one qualification to that is his regular use of an illegal drug in the years leading up to this offence. 

6The question becomes at first, whether the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree. If he was, then the authorities require that a full time custodial sentence must be imposed unless there are exceptional circumstances. I will say immediately that I do not see any exceptional circumstances here, but I also do not accept that the offender's conduct can be categorised as trafficking to a substantial degree. He was the junior partner in the transaction, acted on this single occasion at the direction of Mr Spalaviero and the nature of his involvement can be perhaps best illustrated by the fact that he was charged and pleaded guilty to an offence of knowingly taking part in a supply rather than supply itself. So that conclusion means that a full time custodial sentence is not required. It may, nevertheless, be appropriate, which is something which remains for consideration. 

7The offender was born in 1988 and brought up in a close and loving family on Sydney's northern beaches. He lived at home at the time of this offence and continues to live there with his family. The family spend a great deal of time together, sharing a common interest in water-skiing. The family spend most weekends at Wiseman's Ferry. The offender has a relationship of recent origin. The Probation and Parole Service contacted the offender's partner who expressed disdain for Mr Brannigan's former lifestyle and reported significant positive changes which have persuaded her to remain with the offender. 

8He left school at Year 10. After that he qualified as a carpenter and has been primarily self-employed. The evidence would suggest that the offender is a hard worker and has a positive attitude towards his career choice. 

9Since the offence it is undeniable that there have been significant changes in the offender and his conduct. People that know him report that he is much more subdued as he understands, I accept, the weight of the burden that is now placed upon him and which he has placed upon his family. He understands, I trust, the real risk that he would go to full time custody and, indeed, I trust he has heard the Crown submission that that is the only possible outcome of today's sentencing proceedings. 

10The evidence would suggest that since being charged with this matter he has given up his drug use. His parents have, to some extent anyway, taken a bit more control over the offender's life than ordinarily people of his age would expect. Of course, that is entirely appropriate given the circumstances faced by the offender today. Amongst many things that his parents have done, they have required him to undergo regular urinalysis tests. Those which have been provided to me, and there is no suggestion that there are others I have not seen, reveal that he has abstained from drug use. That, of course, is an important matter as regards the offender's future. 

11The offender is said to be remorseful, although his remorse seems to be focussed on the effect of his criminality on himself and his family. He recognises the effect of what he has done on his family and is sorry for that. There seems to be less of an understanding of just how bad his decision to assist in the supply of a large quantity of cocaine really is. 

12The offender's predicament today is a very good illustration of one of the dangers involved in cocaine use. Not to put too fine a point on it, it is addictive, it is expensive and often drug addicts will commit crimes in order to supply their addiction. Sometimes, like this offender, they supply and become involved in supply for free drugs. Other drug users break into peoples' homes. Other drug users rob innocent members of society, all so that they can obtain money to satisfy an addiction. I do not believe the offender really understands how serious his conduct was and the effect that drug supply has on the community in general. 

13It is a matter of good fortune in this case that the drugs themselves did not actually reach the ultimate end users, having been seized by police upon the offender's arrest.

14The offender, consistent with his immediate admission of guilt to the police, pleaded guilty at an early stage and so the sentence I will impose upon him is twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

15The offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. His positive work ethic and his family support are important matters in making that finding. He has ceased to associate with people he was associating with before and his friends and socialising are of a much more positive nature. 

16The question becomes what sentence to impose upon the offender? As I said, had I found that he was trafficking to a substantial degree, I would have imposed a full time custodial sentence consistent with the authorities because I do not believe that there are exceptional circumstances in this case. As I also said earlier, just because I find that he was not trafficking to a substantial degree does not mean that a full time custodial sentence is inappropriate. 

17I take into account that the offender was certainly not the prime mover in this offence and that this appears to have been an isolated involvement in an act of supply. I take into account that this was the offender's first offence and that he appears to be a different person today from the person he was on 27 September last year. 

18One of the most basic questions regarding the choice of sentence to impose upon an offender is this, is a custodial sentence required? If the answer to that question is yes, then other questions arise, the length of the sentence and then, if relevant, what form a sentence should take. I am back at the first question. Is a custodial sentence required? I do not believe that it is. The offender's subjective circumstances, which I have outlined, and the nature of the offender's objective criminality are such that the Crown has not persuaded me that a custodial sentence is required. 

19I note that the offender was assessed as being suitable to perform community service. I therefore sentence him as follows: The offender is convicted. He is ordered to perform 400 hours community service. He is to attend the Dee Why District Office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days.

20Now Mr Brannigan please stand up. I am required to explain the sentence to you. You are required to perform 400 hours service to the community. I do not know what form that will take but it will be of assistance to someone in the community that you are doing that. Let me tell you what happens if you do not do what you are required. The Probation and Parole Service will contact me and you will be back here in a courtroom in this building looking at me, not another judge, you will be looking at me. I can guarantee that if you have not taken advantage of what the Crown is no doubt thinking is a very lenient sentence, (and I suspect your lawyer might think that too), if you do not take advantage of this lenient sentence, then that is going to say to me quite a bit about your character and not in a positive way at all. If you do not complete this community service order without any trouble at all, I think it is quite likely you will be going to gaol, do you understand that?

21OFFENDER: Yes.

		23 March 2012",2012-02-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708605,JB v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 12,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA : The appellant was convicted after trial for the murder of Edward Spowart (the deceased) arising out of an incident in the early hours of 21 April 2008. The jury, by its verdict, accepted that it was the appellant who had stabbed the deceased three times, causing his death. 

2The trial judge sentenced the appellant to a non-parole period of 16 years to date from 22 April 2008 with the balance of term of 7 years expiring on 21 April 2031. 

3The appellant appeals in relation to both his conviction and sentence. 

4On the conviction appeal, the appellant complains in relation to two discrete matters. The first is that the trial judge should not have admitted the admissions that the appellant made to Sean Clayton, a support person. Secondly, it is claimed that her Honour should have left self-defence to the jury, even though the appellant's case at trial was that he had not been involved in the stabbing of the deceased. 

Facts at trial 

5The events leading to the death of the deceased arose out of a confrontation between members of two ethnic groups late in the evening of 20 April 2008. The appellant and his group of friends were in the concourse area of Granville Railway Station at the time. Each had been drinking, although the precise amount was difficult to determine. Each of these men was a person of Sudanese origin. 

6The second group of men, which included the deceased, were of Fijian or Islander origin. There was a confrontation between members of the two groups and this escalated into a brawl on the streets of Granville. It seems that a number of men and youths armed themselves with sticks, bricks and street signs. The trial judge found, however, that the deceased played no active part in the confrontation or the later hostilities which erupted. Her Honour described the deceased as ""an innocent bystander"". It seems he had retreated to the relative safety of a grass verge and was carrying nothing more than a plastic shopping bag when the appellant ran towards him with a knife and viciously assaulted him. He was stabbed three times. The wounds were to the chest, abdomen and leg. The latter incision severed the femoral artery, leading to the deceased's death within a short time, despite the attendance of ambulance personnel at the scene. 

7The initial confrontation was in fact initiated by the appellant. It was near midnight when the appellant approached the other group of men at Granville Station. The appellant asked for a cigarette but was rebuffed and told to go home. Apparently reacting out of a wounded sense of pride, the appellant threw a punch. There was retaliation from the other group of men in the form of pushing and then later chasing the Sudanese group from the station concourse down into the street. The trial judge noted in her remarks on sentence that the deceased could be seen on CCTV at this point leaving the station concourse by an alternative route. At no time did he engage in any contact with the appellant or his friends. 

8In any event, some of the deceased's friends from the group at the railway station continued to chase the appellant and at least one other young male a short distance through the streets near the station. Eventually, they gave up the chase and returned to where the others were near the station. As they made their way home on foot, the group encountered the appellant, who by this time was with a group if young males, some of whom were armed with sticks or poles which they were brandishing. The appellant was at the forefront of this group, armed with a knife which he had retrieved from a nearby location, no doubt in anticipation of a fight. The two groups squared off in the middle of the road before coming to blows. 

9The appellant threatened one of the deceased's friends with a knife, lunging towards him a number of times so that retreat was his only option. It was then that the appellant peeled off from the group and circled around the melee. He ran across the road to where the deceased was standing. The deceased was minding his own business and was well removed from the affray. There was no violence offered by the deceased, and he posed no threat to the appellant. He had taken no part in any of the aggressive conduct that his friends may have shown towards the appellant. The trial judge found that the appellant ""targeted Mr Spowart because he was exposed, unarmed, and unprotected"". 

10Sean Clayton worked as a youth liaison officer with the Sudanese community. He attended police stations in his area from time to time to try and assist young Sudanese people in custody. On occasion, he was asked by parents, friends and relatives of members of the Sudanese community to go to police stations to act as a support person for various people. He had performed that role for about 7 years. 

11On 22 April 2008, he awoke to find he had a missed call on his telephone from the previous evening. He rang back at about 10am. The call was from the Merrylands Police Station. He was asked by a police officer to attend the station to act as a support person for the appellant. He arrived at about 11 am and spoke to two detectives and the custody manager. Paperwork was completed in relation to his obligations and responsibilities as a support person. He then went in to see the appellant in an interview room. Only he and the appellant were in the room. He asked the appellant what had happened. The appellant told him he had stabbed a man. Mr Clayton asked the appellant where he had obtained the knife. The appellant replied that it was in the garden where he had put it earlier in the night. 

The course of the trial 

12The appellant did not give evidence at trial. The appellant's case was that the jury could not be satisfied that it was he and not another man who had stabbed the deceased during the altercation. 

13Prior to the empanelment of the jury, there had been a voir dire hearing on the issue as to whether the court should allow the admission into evidence at trial of the statements made by the appellant to Mr Clayton. Ultimately, her Honour determined that there was no unfairness in admitting the statements made by the appellant to Mr Clayton. She found that the admissions the appellant had made fell into the category of ""unguarded incriminating statements"". It was inherent in her Honour's ruling that she considered that the appellant's freedom to speak or refrain from speaking had not been compromised in any way by the circumstances of Mr Clayton's visit to him as a support person. Her Honour rejected the argument that the admissions to Mr Clayton fell within the terms of client legal privilege under s 118 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) ("" Evidence Act ""), or that they fell within the concept of ""protected confidence"" under s 126B of the Evidence Act . 

14Mr Clayton gave evidence before the jury. He repeated the admissions that the appellant had made to him at the police station. In cross-examination it was suggested to Mr Clayton that he was not telling the truth about these admissions, but he adhered to his evidence. 

15At the conclusion of the evidence, the issue as to whether self-defence might be left before the jury was raised. Her Honour expressed the preliminary view that there was ""absolutely no evidence of what the accused personally believed when he inflicted the blows"", assuming that the jury were to find that it was the appellant who had inflicted the knife wounds on the deceased. Other matters were raised as well, including the fact that the vast thrust of the evidence overall was that the deceased had not been part of the fighting groups at any stage and had simply been standing by himself, well away from the point of conflict. He was simply holding a plastic bag and there was no suggestion that he was armed. In the light of that evidence, her Honour asked counsel on what basis she would be entitled to leave self-defence to the jury. There was the additional problem that the defence case was that the appellant was not the person who stabbed the deceased at all. 

16On the following day, Mr Webb, trial counsel for the appellant, renewed his application to the trial judge that self-defence should be left before the jury. In the end, the trial judge determined that she would leave manslaughter on the basis of intoxication (as negativing specific intent) or manslaughter as a result of an unlawful and dangerous act. Her Honour determined that the evidence did not allow her to leave self-defence to the jury. On 31 August 2009, the trial judge gave the jury written directions. These related to the issues she had determined to leave before the jury. On 10 September 2009, the jury retuned with a verdict of guilty of murder. The ultimate sentence hearing proceeded on 16 April 2010 and her Honour delivered sentence on 21 May 2010. 

Conviction Appeal (Ground 1) 

17Mr Michael Smith of counsel appeared for the appellant on the hearing of the appeal. Counsel submitted that the trial judge had applied incorrect principles in her consideration of s 90 of the Evidence Act . It was submitted that her Honour erred in that she: 

(a) Concluded that the appellant's admission fell into the category of ""unguarded incriminating statements""; 

(b) Failed to advert to the regulatory position of the support person and the underlying rationale; 

(c) Held that the relevant inquiry was the appellant's state of mind and in particular whether his freedom to speak or refrain from speaking had been compromised. 

18Mr Smith argued that the position of a support person, assisting a vulnerable person in custody, was a unique one. He argued that, in this case, the categorisation of the admission made was the critical factor. It differed from an admission made knowingly and voluntarily to a police officer. There was no analogy between the admission made to an undercover operative and the admission made to a support person. 

19Mr Smith pointed to the fact that the appellant had plainly refused to say anything to police of any relevance prior to the attendance of the support person. Indeed, in connection with his right to silence, he had deliberately refrained from making any admissions to police, either before or after the conversation with Mr Clayton. 

20Mr Smith submitted that the difference between reliance upon general admissions and the admissions in the present case was to be found in the underlying rationale for the position of a support person: R v Honan (unreported, NSWSC, Hidden J, 24 March 1996); DPP v Toomalatai [2006] VSC 256; 13 VR 319 at [43]-[44]; R v Huynh and Phung [2001] NSWSC 357. 

21Counsel argued that the support person stands in a position that is analogous to the barrister or solicitor who is afforded access to a person in custody. His task is, during the investigative procedure, to counsel, advise and protect. He must ensure that a person in custody is treated in accordance with his or her rights. In effect, the support person must stand between the police and the accused person while that person is in custody. It was within that framework that, in the present case, there arose an element of unfairness in admitting the admissions made to the support person. 

22Mr Smith argued further that the situation in the present case was compounded by the manner in which the alleged admission had been dealt with after it had occurred. Mr Clayton had refused to make a statement to police. Though police made a record of what Mr Clayton told them, at no time was the appellant given the opportunity to either adopt or disavow what was alleged to have been said. It would have been appropriate, counsel submitted, for the police to inform both the appellant and his solicitor of what had occurred and thereby give the appellant the opportunity to comment on the suggestion he had made admissions to Mr Clayton. 

Resolution (Ground 1) 

23On this appeal, the appellant did not press the arguments advanced at trial relating to s 118 of the Evidence Act nor those relating to a ""protected confidence"" under s 126B of the Evidence Act. The principal contention, as I have said, was that the admissions to the support person should have been excluded pursuant to s 90 of the Evidence Act. This provides as follows: 

""90. Discretion to exclude admissions 

(1) In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 

(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 

(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence."" 

24In Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; 232 CLR 67, Gummow and Hayne JJ described the discretion given by s 90 as a ""safety net"" provision. Their Honours also stated (at 109): 

""When it is 'unfair' to use evidence of an out-of-court admission at the trial of an accused person cannot be described exhaustively. 'Unfairness', whether for the purposes of the common law discretion or for the purposes of s 90, may arise in different ways."" 

25In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Heydon J in Em v The Queen , their Honours traced the origins of s 90 to the Australian Law Reform Commission's Report on Evidence (Report No 38, 1987) and to the common law discretion discussed in R v Lee (1950) 82 CLR 133 at 151-155. The Report had said: 

""The Lee discretion focuses on the question of whether it would be unfair to the accused to admit the evidence. The discretion to exclude illegally or improperly obtained evidence requires a balancing of the public interest. It would, therefore, be less effective than the Lee discretion. In the situation where the confession was obtained because the accused proceeded on a false assumption, there is a need for a discretion to enable the trial judge to exclude evidence of admissions that were obtained in such a way that it would be unfair to admit the evidence against the accused who made them. Such a discretion should be added to the proposal."" 

26Their Honours, having referred to the Report, continued (at 56): 

""The language in s 90 is so general that it would not be possible in any particular case to mark out the full extent of its meaning. Whether or not the appellant is correct to submit that the primary focus of s 90 was on incorrect assumptions made by accused persons, there is no doubt that it is one focus of s 90 and it is one which is relevant to the way in which counsel submit the appellant's incorrect assumption should be viewed. In any particular case, the application of s 90 is likely to be highly fact-specific."" 

27In the Court of Criminal Appeal ( R v Sophear Em [2003] NSWCCA 374) Howie J (with whom Ipp JA and Hulme J) observed that: 

""Section 90 in effect confers on the trial judge a discretion to reject evidence of admissions where to admit them would result in an unfair trial for the accused. It is unfairness arising from the use of the admissions by the prosecution that is central to the discretion under the section and not whether the police unfairly treated the accused. The purpose of the discretion is the protection of the rights and privileges of the accused. It is concerned with the right of an accused to a fair trial and includes a consideration of whether any forensic advantage has been obtained unfairly by the Crown from the way the accused was treated ( R v Swaffield ; Pavic v The Queen [1998] HCA 1; 192 CLR 159 at [78])."" 

28A central argument advanced by Mr Smith related to what he described as the ""unique position"" of the support person. Counsel was eventually driven to take an absolute position arising from his argument that it is the role of a support person to stand between the police and the accused while the accused is in custody. For that reason, counsel submitted, it is unfair to admit admissions made by an accused person to a support person in any circumstance. No matter how the admission came to be made, it should not be admitted into evidence. Mr Smith argued that, if this were not so, the position of the support person would be reduced to a complete nullity. 

29With respect, I am unable to accept this argument. I shall briefly state my reasons. First, Mr Clayton's relationship with the appellant did not fall within any of the restricted categories of relationship (as outlined by Parliament) that protect unique relationships. There is, for example, no protection equivalent to s 118 Evidence Act for the relationship between a support person and a juvenile. There is no protection for the relationship between a support person and a juvenile as a ""special relationship"" such as may arise under s 126A, or in the case of religious confessions (s 127) and other privileged communications. 

30Secondly, it may be seen that there is a fundamental difference between each of those ""protected"" relationships and the relationship, on the other hand, of a support person and young person. Certain specific relationships have been given special legislative protection because it is central to the function of those relationships that free and frank disclosure exist between the two persons involved. For example, a lawyer needs to obtain confidential information from his client to do his job adequately. It is part of the legal requirement of the solicitor/client relationship that confidences exchanged between them are to be strictly treated as confidential by the practitioner. No such legal or ethical relationship applies to a person playing a support role for a juvenile at a police station. The fundamental role of the support person is to assist the juvenile in his or her dealings with the police. It is to protect children from the disadvantaged position they are in as a consequence of their age. It is to protect them from police impropriety or from the disadvantages that arise simply because they are in a custodial situation and at the mercy of mature and experienced police officers ( R v Honan; DPP v Toomalatai; and R v Huynh and Phung ). 

31In a given situation, the role undertaken by a support person may require that advice be given to a juvenile that he or she may or should remain silent during a police interview; it may require the tendering of advice or the giving of practical assistance during the actual interview itself. Such a role, though important, does not demand per se confidentiality in relation to admissions made freely by the juvenile to the support person outside the interview room, and in the absence of the police. 

32Thirdly, Mr Smith's reliance on the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation 2005 (NSW) does not advance his argument. Particular reliance was placed by counsel on clauses 27(4) and 34(2). 

33Reg 27 requires that a detained person who is a vulnerable person be entitled to have a support person present during any investigative procedure in which the detained person is to participate. Clause 27(4) requires the custody manager to give the detained person reasonable facilities to enable the person to arrange for a support person to be present and allow the detained person to do so in circumstances in which, so far as is practical, the communication will not be overheard. 

34Reg 34 provides that if the detained person is given a caution in the absence of a support person, the caution must be given again in the presence of a support person, if one attends during the person's detention. 

35Reference was also made to s 13 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 which renders inadmissible in evidence an admission given to a member of the police force by a child unless there was present at the place where, and throughout the period of time during which, the admission was made, a person responsible for the child, an adult (other than the member of the police force) who was present with the consent of the child, or an Australian legal practitioner of the child's own choosing. 

36In my opinion neither the Act nor the Regulations on which Mr Smith placed reliance alter or enlarge the essential role of a support person. Nor do they provide an absolute prohibition on the admissibility of an admission or confession made by a juvenile to a support person. 

37Of course, it does not follow that every admission made to a support person, even if given freely, will be admissible in criminal proceedings against the juvenile. If the support person has cajoled or tricked the accused into making an admission, it may well be that s 90 has effective work to do. Similarly, if the support person has been acting at the direction of the police, there may emerge a powerful argument as to why the admission should not be allowed at the trial. There is no need to envisage or list the many possible circumstances that might be said to constitute unfairness so as to warrant the justified use of the safety-net provided by s 90 Evidence Act . 

38The fact that the police are directed by the Regulation to allow privacy to the support person and the accused really says nothing as to whether a voluntary admission made to the support person in a private conversation between them is or is not admissible. Similarly, the fact that an accused juvenile is to be ""re-cautioned"" in front of the support person simply lends support to the proposition that the support person's role extends to his being satisfied that there is a protection in place while the police are interviewing the accused. 

39Ultimately, Mr Smith was driven to argue that a support person must himself administer a caution to the accused as soon as he meets him in private, a caution directed to any communication passing between the two of them. Such a requirement simply does not emerge from the nature of the support person's role or from the relationship of the accused juvenile in custody and the support person. 

40Mr Smith's principal argument fails ultimately because his attempt to equate the position of a support person with that of a lawyer, counsellor, priest or other confidant in a special position is simply not warranted. If the legislature thought that special protection should be extended to communications between a support person and a juvenile, it could have extended the range of protected relationships. It has not done so. 

41In the present matter, the appellant knew Mr Clayton. When the two were alone together Mr Clayton simply asked ""What happened?"" This question was entirely neutral and did not require the making of any admission. Nor did it place any pressure on the appellant or, so far as can be ascertained, create any unfairness. In this context, it is not unimportant to note that no evidence was given by the appellant as to his belief, his understanding or assumptions in relation to Mr Clayton. The trial judge was correct to find that the appellant's admission fell into the category of an unguarded incriminating statement. I do not consider that her Honour failed to take into account a relevant matter by not discussing at length the regulatory position of the support person and its underlying rationale. Nor do I consider that her Honour was incorrect to record, as she did, that the relevant inquiry was into the appellant's state of mind and, in particular, whether his freedom to speak or refrain from speaking had been compromised. Each of these matters was an appropriate and relevant consideration to the discretionary exercise under s 90. 

42A second argument raised by Mr Smith was that there was some significance in the fact that when the appellant had been cautioned by the police he said nothing, but then made an admission to the support person in the absence of the police. In this regard, Mr Smith pointed out that, after his conversation with Mr Clayton, the appellant on a second occasion declined to make any admissions to the police. 

43It is difficult to see this second argument assisting the appellant. Rather it tells against him. It further supports the finding made by the trial judge that this was an unguarded incriminating statement. In the absence of any evidence from the appellant, it is impossible to say on what basis or assumption he acted in making his statement to Mr Clayton. The position is no different than if he made the admission to a family member or friend who visited him in custody. If that had been the situation, in the absence of special circumstances, there would have been no capacity for s 90 to have any operation. The fact that thereafter he again declined to be interviewed does not advance the appellant's position. 

44Finally, Mr Smith argued that there may have been some impropriety in the fact that the police, after learning from Mr Clayton that an admission had been made by the accused, did not immediately convey this information to the appellant or his solicitors. With respect, it is difficult to see that these circumstances could have any bearing on the situation. Section 90 is concerned with the circumstances ""in which the admission was made"". It is those circumstances that require careful analysis to determine whether it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence at trial. 

45For these reasons, I conclude that ground 1 has not been established. 

Conviction Appeal (Ground 2) 

46Mr Smith. asserts that the trial judge erred in not directing the jury in relation to the issue of self defence. In my view, this ground must fail. 

47The obligation of a trial judge to leave an issue such as self-defence is well known. Pemble v R ([1971] HCA 20; (1971) 124 CLR 107) does not oblige a trial judge to give a direction in relation to a defence issue unless it is reasonably open on the evidence: see Carney v R; Cambrey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223. (This is a recent decision of this Court where the scope of the obligation to leave manslaughter as an alternative to murder is discussed at length.) See also R v Park [2003] NSWCCA 203; Douglass v R [2005] NSWCCA 419; Mencarious v R (2008) 189 A Crim R 219 at [65]. 

48In the present matter, the trial judge gave careful and thorough consideration to the issue as to whether self-defence should be left. Her Honour recognised that the appellant's case at trial was that he was not involved in stabbing the deceased and, in that situation, did not need to do any act in self-defence. However, her Honour also recognised that the appellant's case at trial did not preclude self-defence being left to the jury, if other evidence raised the issue on a realistic basis. Of course the appellant did not give evidence and this led her Honour to comment that, for self-defence to be left to the jury, it would have involved ""inviting the jury to speculate what was in his mind at that particular time based on circumstances that are really of a fairly, background nature"" (Transcript 677 line 30). 

49There were three separate phases to the activity on the night in question. The first involved a dispute between the appellant and the man he had asked for a cigarette. A punch was thrown by the appellant and there was retaliation from the other group of men in the form of pushing and chasing. The deceased had nothing to do with this preliminary scuffle and he was seen on CCTV leaving the station concourse by an alternative route to the others. 

50The second phase involved the group of men who had first chased the appellant. It did not involve the deceased. The group encountered the appellant and his friends who by now were armed with sticks or poles. The appellant was at the forefront of this group, as I have said, armed with a knife which he had retrieved from a nearby location. There was no evidence to suggest that the deceased was part of either of the groups during the fight that ensued in this second phase. 

51The third phase involved the appellant moving away from the two scuffling groups and circling around the outskirts of the melee. It was at that point, that the appellant ran across the road to where the deceased was standing, holding a plastic shopping bag. There was no evidence of any violence or threat being offered by the deceased. It was clear, as I have said, that he had taken no part in any of the aggressive conduct in either of the two earlier phases of activity. He was, as the trial judge found in her sentencing remarks simply an ""innocent bystander"". It was at that stage that the appellant stabbed the deceased three times. 

52In argument, Mr Smith sought to make something of the fact that the admission made to Mr Clayton at the police station had included a statement by the appellant: 

""The knife was in the garden that he had put there earlier that night. And when the fight started, he ran back and grabbed it because he was frightened ... He said because some man was bashing him up - he said it was over a cigarette."" 

53Mr Smith argued that the terms of this admission might suggest that it was the deceased who was ""bashing him up"". 

54Her Honour, however, was entitled to look at the whole of the evidence in the trial. It was absolutely clear from that evidence that the deceased was not the man who had refused to give the appellant the cigarette and who had been involved in the initial scuffle. Whether the appellant had such a belief, or whether he had any particular state of mind, was simply not revealed by the evidence in the trial. The appellant was perfectly entitled not to give evidence before the jury and his counsel could not be criticised in that regard. The absence of evidence from the appellant, however, meant that the trial judge had to examine the evidence as a whole in determining whether self-defence ought to have been left to the jury. Her Honour applied herself to that task assiduously and reached, in my opinion, a permissible conclusion. 

55I conclude that the trial judge was not bound to direct the jury on the self-defence hypothesis as it was not one reasonably open, having regard to the evidence at trial. 

Sentence Appeal (Ground 3) 

56The appellant seeks leave to appeal on sentence alleging at the outset that the sentencing judge applied the wrong statutory ratio to the sentence and failed to give effect to her finding of special circumstances. Prior to addressing this ground of appeal, it is convenient to say something as to her Honour's general remarks on sentence. Her Honour said she was unable to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to kill the deceased. In this regard, she noted that his capacity to make a reasoned judgment had been compromised by his intoxication. That said, her Honour had no difficulty in concluding that the objective gravity of the offence was nonetheless high. At paragraph 12 ROS her Honour said: 

""The use of a knife, in company, in a public street late at night, with a degree of premeditation, justifies a sentence in the order of 25 years in my view, before account is taken of the offender's subjective circumstances. Such a sentence would necessarily give expression to the principle of general deterrence. The offender's youth should result in some amelioration of that penalty, given that the law recognises that the emphasis lies on the rehabilitation of a juvenile offender, rather than on general deterrence. The extent of the departure from that sentence ought not result in a penalty which fails to reflect the objective gravity of the offence, having regard to the fact that the offender was not so young that he did not appreciate the consequences of his conduct. More importantly, notwithstanding the offender's youth, general deterrence is still a significant factor in this case given that the type of conduct engaged in by the offender is regrettably not an uncommon occurrence in suburban streets at night, where young males gather, fuelled by alcohol and intent on proving their manhood."" 

57Her Honour then outlined the appellant's subjective circumstances. His history was undoubtedly a tragic one. It appears to have been accepted that at the time of his sentence he was a few months short of his eighteenth birthday. He was fifteen at the time of the offence. He and his family had been forced out of the Sudan in 1996 due to civil unrest. They travelled from there to Kenya but they were separated from the appellant's father whom they did not see again until 2002. In the intervening period, the appellant, his mother and two sisters remained in a refugee camp in North West Kenya where living conditions were described as ""terrible"". The detail of the conditions in the camp available in the evidence before her Honour demonstrated that it was terrible in the extreme. Later the appellant was taken by his father to Uganda to live with his stepmother and her children while his mother and sisters remained in the refugee camp. His father worked as a doctor within the World Health Organisation until 2004 at which time the family became aware of the father's imprisonment as a political prisoner. The appellant has had virtually no contact with his father since that time. 

58In 2005 the appellant came to Australia with his stepfamily. By then it included four stepbrothers and two stepsisters. The appellant completed an English language course which enabled him to attend high school in 2006 and 2007. It was about this time that the appellant's behaviour changed considerably for the worse. He stayed away from home for increasing periods of time and did not obey house rules or curfews. 

59In 2007/early 2008 the appellant left the family home for a 6-month period. This appears to have been the beginning of his serious abuse of alcohol and cannabis. He received Centrelink benefits, spending most of his money however on ""clothes, alcohol and smokes"". Her Honour found it difficult to determine whether the material before the court demonstrated that the appellant had been thrust into a social and educational environment with which he could not cope, or whether he simply chose to drift into an association with other dislocated and unmanageable Sudanese youths. 

60Her Honour was doubtful as to the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation. His behaviour in custody has not been ideal although he had apparently completed an anger management programme and was continuing his studies whilst at Kariong Detention Centre. Her Honour then said: 

""While I am mindful of the importance of managing the offender's return to the community upon his release, and of the primacy of rehabilitation in the circumstances of this case, the non-parole period cannot be reduced too far below the statutory proportion, lest it fails to reflect punishment and retribution for the loss of a life. The real dimensions of that loss were brought home to the court by the victim impact statements which spoke movingly of the impact of the victim's death on all the members of his family."" 

61It is clear from her Honour's remarks and the sentence she imposed that a finding of special circumstances was made. Her Honour's sentence, in mathematical terms, reflected a finding of special circumstances. The non-parole period constituted 69.5 per cent of the total sentence. Consequently, there does appear to be a moderate alteration of the statutory relationship required by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The degree of any adjustment to the statutory ratio, it should be said, is generally a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56 at [33]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [31]. 

62It is necessary to keep steadfastly in mind that, when a ground of appeal is taken relating to the appropriateness of the ratio between non-parole and parole periods, the appellate court is to have regard to whether the non-parole period imposed is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody. It must have regard to all of the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the offence and the offender's subjective circumstances: Power v R (1974) 131 CLR 623 at [627-629]; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [59]. 

63In the present matter, a significant period of time for rehabilitation has been allowed within the structure of the sentence selected by her Honour. The total period of time the appellant will be on parole is 7 years. In itself, this must be seen as a lengthy period of time in which the rehabilitation of the appellant might be achieved: R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher (2007) 177 A Crim R 94 per Howie J. 

64In my opinion this ground of appeal has not been established. 

Sentence Appeal (Ground 4) 

65This ground asserts that the sentencing judge did not take into account sufficiently (or at all) the mitigating factors set out in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

66The particular complaint is that her Honour did not sufficiently take into account the following matters: 


the offence was not part of a plan or organised criminal activity; and 
that the appellant did not have any prior criminal record. 

67It is trite to observe that a sentencing judge is not obliged to refer to each of the s 21A factors as though running through some type of ""check-list"". It is necessary to take these matters into account, of course, but only to the extent they are relevant to the case the court is considering: R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193; R v Lilley (2004) 150 A Crim R 591 at [41], [53]; R v Elyard [2006] NSWCCA 43 at [5]. 

68It is accepted that her Honour did not make a finding that there was a planned activity involved here resulting in the need to take into account an aggravating feature of the crime. However, her Honour's remarks on sentence make it clear that she could not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the appellant's involvement in the murder was not planned, even if that plan was one that was contemplated only moments before the attack. I agree with the Crown submission that, whether or not this attack on the deceased was planned or unplanned was, in the circumstances, a matter of little moment. The critical issue was the criminality in the eruption of street violence involving an offender brandishing a knife and attacking an innocent bystander. The question of the actual degree of planning was unlikely to make any real difference to the ultimate sentence. Her Honour did, of course, make reference to the use of a knife ""with a degree of pre-meditation"", referring to the place where the knife was kept and its retrieval. 

69The final complaint relates to the fact that the appellant had no prior criminal record. This was a matter acknowledged by her Honour in her remarks on sentence (para 24). There was no need for her Honour to mention the terms of s 21A(3)(e). Her Honour gave careful consideration to the features of the applicant's subjective circumstances, particularly the difficulties of his upbringing and the tragic circumstances of his family's expulsion from their native country. I do not consider that her Honour was required to do any more than she did in relation to those brief portions of her remarks where the appellant's absence of criminal record was noted. Neither of these complaints has been made out. 

Overall 

70I have been troubled to some extent in relation to whether sufficient weight was given in the sentencing process to the issue of the appellant's youth. He was after all only 15 at the time of the commission of the offence and it must be the situation that the horrific circumstances of his early upbringing meant that he did not have the level of parental supervision, both in Kenya and here in Australia, that was available to other young people of less troubled backgrounds. Nevertheless, it ought to be noted that no separate submission was made on this basis in the appeal before us. I have considered this aspect of the matter carefully but, on balance, I have decided that her Honour's thorough and careful analysis of the disparate factors that pulled in different directions on this difficult sentencing exercise has not been shown to be erroneous. Although the appellant's situation has been shown to be a sad and tragic one, in the end I consider that her Honour was correct in emphasising the objective seriousness of this offence and the strong need for both general and personal deterrence in relation to it. Accordingly, I have concluded that the sentence is not manifestly excessive. 

71I propose the following orders be made: 

1. Appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
2. Leave to appeal against sentence is granted. 
3. Appeal against sentence is dismissed. 

72HISLOP J : I agree with Whealy J. 

73GROVE AJ : I agree with Whealy J.

2708607,R v SCOTT [2012] NSWSC 70,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR : Cameron Scott (the offender) was indicted on a charge that he murdered Melloney Menhennitt (the deceased) at Manly on 12 March 2004. The offender was acquitted by a jury of that charge but was convicted of the alternative charge of manslaughter, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 25 years. The sole basis upon which the alternative charge was left to the jury was that the deceased died as the result of an unlawful and dangerous act on the part of the offender. There is no standard non-parole period which is applicable to the offence of manslaughter. 

2It is my obligation to sentence the offender, in accordance with well-established principles, for the offence of which he has been convicted. That said, at least for present purposes, the factual background to the offence is largely uncontroversial, despite the fact that more than 70 witnesses gave evidence and almost 60 exhibits were tendered during the course of the trial which ran for the best part of 3 months. 

3A co-accused, Michael Widmer was acquitted of the murder and the manslaughter of the deceased. The case against him was decidedly threadbare. It effectively consisted of a response made by Mr Widmer to a question by an acquaintance concerning the deceased's whereabouts. The person who asked it, Stuart Robb, described it as having been asked in a ""light hearted fashion"". Mr Widmer's response, which was both ambiguous and equivocal, was described by Mr Robb as having been made in a ""joking"" manner. It was relied upon by the Crown as having constituted an admission. However, apart from any other consideration, it was at odds with the rest of the evidence adduced at trial. In all the circumstances it was hardly surprising that the jury did not act upon it. Furthermore, the jury was unable to agree in respect of a further alternative charge that asserted that Mr Widmer was an accessory after the fact to the manslaughter of Ms Menhennitt. The Crown subsequently informed the court that that charge had been 'no billed'. 

4The deceased was 23 years of age when she met her fate, although her life had been deeply troubled since she had been about 13. Sadly, from that point in her life both her mental and physical health deteriorated markedly. She also suffered from regular bouts of depression. In her later teenage years she became addicted to heroin and thereafter embarked upon an all too familiar path of self-destruction. That led to quite understandable tensions between her and other members of her family, a matter which was undoubtedly extremely painful for all concerned. In due course she moved out of the family home and took up residence with a much older man named Robert Sender. However, her life continued to spiral out of control despite the fact that she was attending the methadone clinic attached to Royal North Shore Hospital. During this period she sustained herself by selling marijuana to fellow addicts from the clinic. The evidence from both her parents and from Mr Sender was that she was prone to mood swings. She also regularly engaged in tantrums and screaming fits and resorted to violence when affected by drugs. She also consulted her GP, Dr Timothy Barnes, on a regular basis for a variety of physical ailments. Included amongst her problems were debilitating ulcers which made it difficult for her to eat. That in turn caused her weight to drop alarmingly. The evidence clearly establishes that by the time of her death she was very thin and frail and in a very poor physical condition. The extent of her decline evokes very considerable sympathy. 

5In early March 2004 the deceased was introduced to the offender by her friend, Vana Militades. Thereafter she stayed in his room at 197 Sydney Road Fairlight for several days. It was a large, rambling house in which a number of other drug addicts either resided or visited. 

6The critical events which preceded Ms Menhennitt's death occurred during the early hours of the morning of 12 March 2004 in premises at 2/86 Darley Road, Manly, which were leased by Mr Widmer's father, Frank. 

7It is convenient to now refer to the evidence of Angela Muldoon who was the critical witness in the Crown case. She gave evidence of having spent several days preceding the night in question with Michael Widmer at the Darley Road premises recovering from a drug binge. She said that on the afternoon of 11 March she accompanied Mr Widmer to the Steyne Hotel in order to borrow money from his father with which to buy ""ice"". From there, she said, they proceeded on foot to 197 Sydney Road where they purchased the drugs from Suzie Lenton. According to Ms Muldoon, having met up there with the offender and the deceased, the four of them then returned to the unit in Darley Road in the deceased's car. 

8According to Ms Muldoon, the four of them remained at the Darley Road premises until the following morning apart from an occasion on which they went to an address in Balgowlah in order to obtain a further quantity of ""ice"". Ms Muldoon gave evidence that the four of them injected themselves with various quantities of ice and that they also smoked a number of cones of marijuana. She gave evidence about various incidents which had occurred in the unit during the night. These included an occasion on which she said that she had assaulted the deceased, and an occasion on which the deceased remonstrated with the offender as to the way in which he was distributing the drugs between the various persons who were going to use them. She also gave evidence about an incident which had occurred between the offender and the deceased in the bathroom. 

9She then related how, at about 4.30 am, the offender had pursued the deceased when she had run out of the premises. Ms Muldoon said that when she heard the deceased scream she had dispatched Mr Widmer to ascertain what was happening. As I understand the effect of her evidence in the witness box, the deceased had screamed in all on three occasions. By way of contrast, she told police in her first interview that she had heard only the one scream. 

10Shortly thereafter, Ms Muldoon said that she had rung a taxi and had gone to Kings Cross. Before doing so, she said that she had taken a substantial sum of money and a further quantity of drugs from the deceased's purse. She said that she had not seen the deceased again. On the other hand, Ms Muldoon gave inconsistent accounts as to whether she had seen the offender again that morning. In her evidence she said that she had not, whereas in at least one interview with police she indicated that she had seen him returning to the unit with Mr Widmer. 

11One challenge for her, and indeed for other witnesses, was that the events about which she was giving evidence occurred more than 7 years ago. But apart from that consideration, there were a number of aspects of Ms Muldoon's evidence which were unsatisfactory and which served to render her evidence unreliable. For example, the evidence revealed that she had been arrested and charged with various offences arising from her involvement in the events which culminated in the death of Ms Menhennitt. Ms Muldoon was originally charged with being an accessory after the fact to her murder but as a result of her undertaking to give evidence in these proceedings, that charge was dropped. In relation to the two remaining matters with which she had been charged, namely the stealing from, and the assault upon the deceased, she was placed upon a bond. Her co-operation with the authorities no doubt loomed large in the sentencing process, especially as her criminal history includes various entries for matters of dishonesty for which she has served a number of terms of imprisonment. 

12Furthermore, Ms Muldoon had been, on her own admission, a drug addict for a period of 20 years. She candidly admitted that whilst she is on drugs she has no concept of time or the value of money. It is abundantly clear from other objective evidence, including call charge records, that Ms Muldoon had little or no idea of the time or the sequence in which the events, about which she gave evidence, had unfolded. Moreover, some of her evidence, including her explanation as to why she had felt it necessary to assault the deceased by striking her on the face, was completely fanciful. 

13There was also evidence from the taxi-driver who drove Ms Muldoon to Kings Cross that morning that she was ""incoherent"" from drugs during the course of that trip. Her condition clearly affected both her perception of the events of the evening and her capacity to accurately recall what she had seen and heard. It was also very apparent that Ms Muldoon was under the influence of drugs at times whilst she was giving evidence. Indeed her evidence was interrupted, at least twice, when it became apparent that she was in no fit condition to continue with it. 

14As I have implied, Ms Muldoon was spoken to by police on a number of occasions. Not only were there inconsistencies between the various versions which she provided to them but she also told police that her memory was ""a little bit scrambled by drugs"". In her evidence she said that being on drugs meant that ""I wouldn't have known what was true and what wasn't"". 

15That said, some of the things about which Ms Muldoon gave evidence, and particularly in relation to the events that unfolded in the period just prior to the deceased running out of the Darley Road premises, remained uncontradicted. 

16The other witness who gave evidence about the events of that evening was Frank Widmer. His evidence was much narrower in its scope. He said that he had been awoken at about 2 am by a knock on the door. He said that he opened it in order to let in his son Michael, the offender, the deceased and Ms Muldoon. He said that he told them on a number of occasions during the evening to be quiet. He gave evidence that the deceased was continually making noise by screaming loudly and that all of them, including the offender, had tried to quieten her down. Ms Muldoon gave evidence to similar effect. He gave evidence that the deceased and the offender had left the unit at about 4.30 am. He said that when he left for work at about 6.15 am his son, Michael, was still there and that some-one else was with him. However, he said that he was uncertain whether it was Ms Muldoon or the offender who was with Michael. Although his account of events is to be preferred where it differs from that given by Ms Muldoon, the reliability of his evidence was to some extent affected by the fact that, consistently with his lifestyle, he had consumed a not insignificant quantity of alcohol during the evening about which he gave evidence. 

17The offender did not give, or call evidence at the trial. He had however been interviewed on three separate occasions by the police being 8 April 2004, 28 October 2004 and 20 January 2010 respectively. It was on that latter date that he was arrested and charged with the deceased's murder. It is common ground that his sentence should be ordered to commence on that date. 

18A critical part of the Crown case emerged from the contents of listening device material which captured conversations between the offender and a police undercover operative who was codenamed 'Ray'. Those conversations took place on 11 and 21 May 2004 respectively at Manly Oval. During the course of them, the offender told 'Ray' that whilst they were in the bathroom the deceased had stabbed him in the chest with her comb which had snapped. He told 'Ray' that he had thrown her against the wall and asked her what her problem was. He said that shortly thereafter she had run out of the unit and down the road to the corner screaming loudly. (In speaking of 'the corner', it may be assumed that the offender was referring to the intersection of Darley and Addison Roads). He said that he had followed her out of the unit and that she had called out ""Somebody help me"". He told 'Ray' that he had grabbed her shoulders and told her to ""shut the fuck up"". He said that they had had an altercation following which he had ""fucking plonked her fucking straight on her arse"". In the second of those conversations the offender told 'Ray' that he had ""given her the fucking shoulder"" and that he had left her ""sprawled [on the ground and] just fucking bawling"". He said that he had then returned to the unit. It may be observed that at no stage did the offender admit to 'Ray' that he had killed the deceased. That was despite the fact that 'Ray' was acting as an agent provocateur and was clearly seeking to extract admissions from the offender in circumstances in which the offender was oblivious to the fact that their conversations were being recorded. 

19It is to be observed that what the offender told 'Ray' was at odds with what he told police. In the first such interview he acknowledged that he had followed the deceased for some distance, whereas in the latter two interviews he said that he had left the premises to look for her but had been unable to see her. I accept the Crown's submission that he had been endeavouring, in the latter two interviews, to distance himself from the altercation that he had had with the deceased. The inconsistent versions which the offender provided could scarely have advanced his credibility in the eyes of the jury. 

20The offender also made admissions to other people that he had had a physical encounter with the deceased on the evening in question. He told Gary Foord, with whom he shared a room at 197 Sydney Road, that she had become hysterical and that he had tried to ""calm her down and shake some sense into her"". He told another resident of the house, Katherine Newson, that the deceased ""had flipped out and that he had hit her"" because she was out of control. The offender told Vana Militades that he had slapped her to ""calm her down"" and that she had become ""erratic"". Furthermore, Ms Muldoon gave evidence of being present at a conversation during the course of which her friend, Michael Lees, asked the offender how he had killed the deceased. She said that whilst at no stage during the conversation had the offender admitted that he had killed her, he did acknowledge that he had shaken the deceased. 

21The Crown also relied upon a further conversation about which Ms Muldoon gave evidence that was not the subject of challenge. She said that the offender told her, a few days after the deceased's disappearance, that the deceased was in East Wing, a psychiatric ward that is attached to Manly Hospital. Records were produced which demonstrated that she was not in that facility. It can be inferred that the offender proffered that information in an endeavour to deflect Ms Muldoon from making further inquiries about the deceased's whereabouts even though he was plainly aware that she was not in that facility. 

22The Crown also relied upon a body of evidence from more that 30 persons who lived in close proximity to 2/86 Darley Road i n support of its contention that the deceased had been pursued to the intersection of Darley and Addison Roads by the offender. It was further contended that it was there that they had had an altercation before she had continued along Addison Road and up into High Street. Indeed, there was evidence from two witnesses who heard a young woman in distress in the vicinity of the pathway which runs between High Street and Darley Road. From that body of evidence it is clear that the offender had ample opportunity to kill the deceased at some stage in the early hours of that morning. 

23That group of witnesses related what they had heard and/or seen in the early hours of the morning of 12 March 2004. Some of them lived in Darley Road itself, some of them in Addison Road and some in High Street. Not surprisingly, the various witnesses gave evidence of having heard and/or seen quite different things. A few witnesses said, for example, that they had heard the sound of footsteps. Several of them gave evidence that the sounds which they had heard indicated that the person was wearing high heeled shoes. That testimony was at odds however with other evidence about the state of the deceased's footwear. Some witnesses said that they had heard the sound of only the one person screaming whereas other witnesses thought that there were two people involved in what appeared to them to be a domestic argument or some kind of drunken encounter. Still other witnesses thought that a male person was also involved but that he was either trying to calm the female down or that he was providing comfort to her. 

24Notwithstanding those differences in the accounts given by the various witnesses, it is clear that the version of events which the offender provided to 'Ray' bears significant similarity to what emerged from the evidence given by the various neighbours who lived in the vicinity of Darley Road and surrounding streets. A number of them provided descriptions of the screams which they had heard. They were described by two witnesses as being ""bloodcurdling"", and by others as ""spine-chilling"", ""piercing"" and ""hysterical"". The screams were of such a nature as to draw a number of the witnesses out of their residences and on to the street in order to investigate what the disturbance was about. Some of those persons even equipped themselves with items such as broomsticks. I accept that that body of evidence demonstrated that the screams were those of a young woman in distress and not the type of noise that might have arisen from a domestic dispute or from party revellers. The overwhelming inference is that the screams were made by the deceased in the period immediately after she had run out of the Darley Road premises. I am not, however, able to determine with any degree of precision what caused her to scream in that manner. 

25There is evidence of an objective nature from which it can be inferred that the deceased ran out of those premises at some time shortly after 5.40 am. A COPS entry completed at 5.51am records that Karen Elmore, who lived with her husband in an apartment overlooking the intersection of Addison and Darley Roads, reported to police that she had heard a female screaming ""Help me, Help me"" on that corner. However, police who arrived in response at 6.06 am, did not see anyone either at the scene or in the immediate vicinity. Records produced by Brian Thompson, the taxi driver to whom I referred earlier, indicate that the Manly Taxi company received a call at 6.03 am. That was clearly the taxi which took Ms Muldoon to Kings Cross. 

26The evidence reveals that the deceased was last seen alive at around daybreak that morning. Neither her parents nor her friends ever saw her again. Nor did she access her bank account. Furthermore, there is no evidence to indicate that she ever returned to the unit in which she had left her valuables including her wallet (which contained a large amount of money), and other possessions such as her mobile phone, jewellery and items of clothing. 

27As the Crown Prosecutor conceded, it is a curious feature of the case that although some witnesses, including Anthony Elmore and Byron Tsoa-Lee estimated that they had made their way out to the street within a very short period of time, none of them saw anyone on the street when they arrived there. There was certainly no sign of the deceased or anything to indicate how she may have left the scene in such a short space of time. Mr Spencer, who appeared for the offender at the trial, nonetheless accepted that the offender's act in shouldering the deceased in her frail state to the ground could well have led to her death and that if his actions had occasioned her death then such conduct could have constituted an 'unlawful and dangerous' act. In fact the offender, in describing her as being ""all just bones"", acknowledged her compromised physical condition. However, given the uncertain state of the evidence, I am not in a position to conclude that it was that act on the part of the offender that occasioned the death of Ms Menhennitt. Indeed, it is common ground that the actual cause of death remains unknown as does the time and place of her death. 

28The deceased's parents reported her missing to Frenchs Forest Police Station on 24 March 2004. On 3 April 2004 they spoke to representatives from the Manly Daily and the following day an article appeared in that newspaper to the effect that their daughter was missing. The deceased's parents then put up posters around the Manly area indicating that she was missing. She remained missing until 26 September 2009 when her skeletal remains were found on North Head by a couple of bushwalkers. Her body was identified from dental records. It was located in a semi-exposed position in dense bushland some distance from the main road which runs through the National Park at North Head. Such was the extent of the decomposition of the deceased's body that the forensic evidence called by the Crown was unable to establish the manner and cause of her death. The expert evidence established only that she did not die from a knife wound or from a bullet wound or from a fractured skull. That evidence did not however establish how she actually died. 

29It is implicit in the jury's verdict that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the act or acts of the offender that caused the death of Ms Menhennitt. That meant that the Crown had established that she had not died from natural causes including the possibility that she had died of a drug overdose or that she had committed suicide or that her death was 
attributable to one of the many ailments from which she was suffering. 

30The verdict also meant that the Crown had eliminated the reasonable possibility that any other person had been responsible for her death. That said, it was not suggested by Mr Spencer that the finger of suspicion could realistically descend upon any other person. Nor is there any evidence to suggest other than that the offender acted alone. 

31The jury's verdict also signifies that the Crown was unable to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offender acted with the requisite intention to establish the offence of murder. That is scarcely surprising particularly given, as I have said, that the Crown was unable to prove how the deceased was killed or even when, where, or why she met her fate. 

32The Crown submitted however that it should be inferred that the offender was involved, either directly or indirectly, in transporting the deceased's body to the location in which it was found at North Head. It was submitted that because the jury had determined that he was responsible for her death it followed, in the circumstances, that he also had an obvious interest in disposing of her body. 

33In seeking to have the court draw that inference, the Crown also relied upon the fact that in his first record of interview the offender had said that he had driven up to North Head at about 6.30 am on the morning in question to look for the deceased. When the offender was reminded by police in a subsequent interview about what he had earlier said, the offender denied that he had gone up there. Nor was he able to explain why he had originally maintained that he had done so. The Crown contended that the offender had admitted having gone there in order to explain his presence there in the event that he had been seen in the area at that time. 

34The Crown also relied, in the present context, upon evidence of a conversation which took place on 28 April 2004 during which, according to Ms Muldoon, the offender told her that Stuart Robb had been driving around with the deceased's body in the boot of her (the deceased's) car. The offender had retained possession of her car until 4 April 2004 when he surrendered it to police following the article in the Manly Daily which referred to her disappearance. I would not be inclined however to place any reliance upon that conversation. Apart from the fact that Ms Muldoon's evidence concerning the conversation was both ambiguous and contradictory, no evidence was elicited from Michael Lees to support her versions of events despite the fact that Ms Muldoon maintained that he was present at the time. Furthermore, as Mr Spencer submitted, it is highly unlikely that anyone would lend a car to someone which had a body in its boot. Moreover, Mr Robb gave evidence that when he had looked in the boot of the vehicle all that he had seen was ""bags and clothes"". 

35Notwithstanding what I have just said concerning that conversation, I am nonetheless disposed to accept the Crown's submission in support of the contention that the offender had some involvement in the disposal of the deceased's body and that he did so in order to conceal the fact that he had been responsible for her death. Indeed, no cogent reason was advanced as to why I should not so conclude. That said, I am unable to determine what the manner, timing and extent of his involvement in that activity was. Nor am I able to conclude that whatever action the offender took was other than a spontaneous response by him to a situation in which his conduct had resulted in an unintended and unexpected consequence, namely the death of Ms Menhennitt. Nevertheless, the fact that the offender was involved in some fashion in the concealment of the death of Ms Menhennitt must be weighed in the overall assessment of the objective gravity of the crime for which he stands to be sentenced. 

36I also accept that it is entirely possible that the offender was motivated by more than one consideration when he pursued the deceased as she left the Darley Road premises. It is highly likely that the deceased's assault upon him during the incident which had occurred in the bathroom provided a catalyst for him to strike her. By the same token, I accept that he was also genuinely concerned to do something to stop her from screaming, particularly as it was likely that her screams would arouse unwanted attention from the police. As I have said, there was evidence from some of the neighbours that the only male voice which they had heard (which must have been the offender) had been trying to comfort the female, whom as I have said, was clearly the deceased. 

37Regrettably, many questions surrounding the death of Ms Menhennitt remain unanswered. Furthermore, the task of making an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence is made particularly difficult because of the Crown's inability to establish the circumstances in which the deceased met her fate. In those circumstances, it would appear to follow that were it not for the offender's involvement in the concealment of her body, this offence would fall towards the lower end of the spectrum of offences of its kind. 

38The offender was born in January 1968. He was 36 at the time of the offence and is now aged 44. He was born in Port Moresby to a young girl who was only 14 years of age. Because of his mother's age, her parents forced her to surrender the offender for adoption. In due course his adoptive mother moved to the South Coast of New South Wales and divorced her husband. The offender was fostered by his adoptive mother's brother when it became clear that she was suffering from schizophrenia. He was then removed from the care of that family when it was discovered that his foster mother had physically abused him, whereupon he was reunited with his adoptive mother and her husband. At the age of 15 the offender ran away from home to live in Fairlight. Although he had no interest in school, it appears that he remained in steady employment for the next 20 years. For much of that time he worked as a motor mechanic having completed his apprenticeship in 1989. However in 2002 he suffered a back injury and has been on an invalid pension ever since. He has a daughter who was born in 1990. Notwithstanding the fact that he has not seen her since she was 6 years old, his main objective, when he is released from custody, is to reconcile with her. 

39The offender began abusing illicit drugs, including ice, heroin and cocaine as a consequence of the break up of his relationship with the mother of his daughter and the loss of contact with them. In 1996 he commenced a four year relationship with another woman with whom he lived in Byron Bay. When that relationship ended he returned to Manly to live. It was then that his life spiralled out of control because of his dependency upon illicit drugs. The offender reports that he has not used drugs since he has been in custody and his appearance in court gives credence to that assertion. 

40The offender has a criminal record. He was released on probation in the Children's Court at the age of 16 in respect of offences of possessing a firearm and a prohibited weapon. In 1986 he was dealt with for an offence of high range PCA and in the following year for driving whilst disqualified. In 1989 he was fined for driving whilst cancelled and exceeding the speed limit. In 1993 he was dealt with for a further offence of high range PCA . In 1997 he was dealt with for a third time for such an offence and was also ordered to perform a community service order for an offence of driving at a speed dangerous to the public. In 1999 he was fined $100 for possessing a prohibited drug. 

41Although not directly relevant, the offender has been dealt with since the commission of the present offence in 2004 for offences of goods in custody, having custody of a knife in a public place, possession of prohibited drugs, entering enclosed lands and shoplifting. With one exception, when the offender was placed on a bond, those offences resulted in the imposition of pecuniary penalties. 

42I have received victim impact statements from the deceased's family. One was written by her parents and the other by her brother. The feelings which they have so eloquently and poignantly expressed and the grief which they have suffered is entirely understandable. It is quite impossible to adequately summarise that sense of loss in a few sentences and to do so, or to attempt to do so, would detract from the contents of their statement. Clearly no sentence which any court could impose can ever begin to make good that loss. I extend to the family and friends of the deceased my deepest sympathy. The approach of a sentencing judge to statements of this kind is nevertheless now well settled: see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; R v FD & JD (2006) 160 A Crim R 392; MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226. 

43In approaching the task of sentencing the offender, I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act) and to any aggravating and mitigating factors identified in s 21A of the Act which have particular relevance to the case. 

44It is common ground that there is nothing of any relevance in the offender's criminal history. If anything it is something of a surprise, given his turbulent family background, that it is as limited as it is. More importantly, it contains no entries for offences of violence. I have also had regard to the opinion expressed by Ms Newsome, to whom I referred earlier, that the offender's actions are entirely out of character with the person whom she came to know when they shared a house for a period of 5 years. 

45Clearly there has been a delay in bringing the proceedings to finality. In R v Blanco (1999) 106 A Crim R 303, in which Wood CJ at CL with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said: 

The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach: see, in addition to Todd and Mill , the decisions in Harrison (1990) 48 A Crim R 197 at 198-199 and King (1998) 99 A Crim R 288. [at para 16] 

46It is abundantly clear that the offender was a suspect in this matter from the very early stages of the investigation and was to that extent left in a state of ""uncertain suspense"". On the other hand, although he was under no obligation to do so, he could have changed things at any stage by simply revealing the circumstances in which the deceased had met her fate. I am also disposed to conclude that if the offender is able to overcome his dependency upon illicit drugs, he has more than reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, particularly as he has now reached an age of some maturity. The offender is not however entitled to any amelioration of his sentence for having expressed any remorse or contrition. 

47Because the circumstances of the present case are so unusual, it is common ground that there is no utility in having regard to what may be considered to be comparable cases. In any event, it is apt to recall that in R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377, Spigelman CJ with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hall J (with additional remarks) agreed, said that: 

As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in R v Blacklidge (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, esp pp2-3.) In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder ( R v Weinman (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252; R v Hoerler (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 at [39]). 

It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation within any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter. [at paras 133-134] 

48I acknowledge that statistics held by the Judicial Commission are to be regarded with considerable circumspection. That said, in Scott v R [2011] NSWCCA 221, James J considered such statistics in relation to sentences for manslaughter. His Honour, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, observed: 

Statistics for the period between April 2003 and March 2010, some of which were for 234 offenders and some of which were for only 193 of those offenders, showed that head sentences varied between three years and 20 years, that the median head sentence was seven years six months and that non-parole periods varied between 12 months and 16 years, the median non-parole period being three years six months. [at para 62]. 

49Although that material is of some, albeit limited utility, I must exercise my own sentencing discretion based upon the various sentencing considerations to which I have referred. 

50I am disposed to accept Mr Spencer's submission that there should be a finding of ""special circumstances"". In so concluding, I accept that the offender's path to rehabilitation will be facilitated by an extended period in the community on parole following what will have been his first time in custody. 

51What remains at the forefront of the sentencing task is the fact that a human life has been needlessly taken because of the offender's unlawful and reprehensible conduct. Furthermore, in setting the non-parole period I have borne in mind the need to fix the minimum period which the offender must spend in custody. 


Sentence 

52For the manslaughter of Melloney Menhennitt, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to commence on 20 January 2010 and to expire on 19 July 2014 with a total sentence of 7 years and 6 months imprisonment to expire on 19 July 2017. The offender is eligible for release on parole on 19 July 2014.

2708609,Akkawi v R; Akkawi v R [2012] NSWCCA 11,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 3 September 2010 the applicants were sentenced in the District Court to terms of imprisonment, following their pleas of guilty (entered in the Local Court) to two charges (in the case of Mark Akkawi) and three charges (in the case of Paul Akkawi). Each applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed.

2Mark Akkawi pleaded guilty to two counts brought under s 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, of aggravated detaining for advantage (the offence commonly known as kidnapping). Each count carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. In addition, he asked, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), that a further two counts, of robbery in company, itemised on a Form 1 (the ""Form 1 offences""), be taken into account. Pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, each such count (if charged separately) also carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years.

3Paul Akkawi pleaded guilty to the same two counts of aggravated detaining for advantage; the third count to which he pleaded guilty was brought under s 33A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, of discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Like Mark Akkawi, Paul Akkawi asked that a further two offences, of robbery in company, identified on a Form 1, be taken into account pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 

4Colefax DCJ sentenced Mark Akkawi as follows:

Count 1: Imprisonment for 5 years, 11 months and 12 days, commencing on 29 May 2008 and expiring on 10 May 2014, with a non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months and 25 days, expiring on 23 December 2011.

Count 2 (taking into account the Form 1 offences): Imprisonment for 6 years, 9 months and 16 days, commencing on 29 May 2010 (and therefore accumulated by 2 years on the previously imposed sentence), expiring on 16 March 2017, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 28 days, expiring on 25 June 2014. The aggregate sentence was imprisonment for 8 years, 9 months and 16 days, with a non-parole period of 6 years, 27 days (with a balance of term of 2 years, 8 months and 19 days).

5On the two aggravated detain for advantage counts, Colefax DCJ imposed on Paul Akkawi sentences identical to those he had imposed on Mark Akkawi. On the third count, the firearm offence, taking into account the Form 1 offences, he imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years, 9 months and 18 days, commencing on 29 May 2012 and expiring on 16 March 2019, with a non-parole of 4 years and 28 days, expiring on 25 June 2016. As can be seen, this sentence was further accumulated by 2 years upon the second of the earlier imposed sentences. The aggregate sentence imposed on Paul Akkawi was therefore imprisonment for 10 years, 9 months and 16 days, with a non-parole period of 8 years and 27 days.

6In respect of each applicant's pleas of guilty, Colefax DCJ allowed, in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, a reduction of 15% in the sentences he otherwise would have imposed. In respect of each applicant, he found special circumstances justifying departure from the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period specified in s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. In each case he gave as the reasons that each applicant would be sentenced for the first time to imprisonment; his relative youth; his good prospects for rehabilitation; and that his prospects of rehabilitation would be enhanced by a longer period on parole.

7The counting of the sentences down to months and days is one of a number of unusual features of this case. I will return to this in due course.






The facts

Background

8The circumstances of these offences are another of the unusual features of this case. The offences were committed over a two day period in March 2008. The applicants are brothers, then aged 21 (Mark Akkawi) and 23 (Paul Akkawi). Although the facts were put before the sentencing judge by way of an agreed statement, in recounting the circumstances of the offences, for completeness I will draw upon material that emerged during the preparation of the cases to be advanced on behalf of the applicants, and which was not the subject of dispute.

9The applicants are the only two children of an Australian born mother and Lebanese born father. (I will return to deal in more detail with their personal circumstances. For present purposes I include only that which is necessary to comprehend the circumstances of the offending.)

10In about 2007, the applicants' mother inherited from her mother a sum of about $250,000. After paying some gambling debts of Paul Akkawi, she put aside $150,000 (in cash), intending to use it to build a house for investment purposes on land that had belonged to her mother. In October 2007, Mrs Akkawi travelled to Dubai to work. She left the money in the charge of Paul Akkawi, to be used for the building work. Paul Akkawi had already developed a significant gambling problem, and promptly applied $50,000 of the money to that activity; the money was lost. He then borrowed, at a high interest rate, $50,000 in order to finance the building work. He lost this money to gambling as well.

11Some time in 2007, Paul Akkawi was introduced to a person called George Tzortzis. After a time, Tzortzis and Paul Akkawi entered into an agreement for the supply of cocaine, at a discounted price, by Tzortzis to Paul Akkawi. (It was never Tzortzis' intention to supply the cocaine.)

The offences

Count 1: Aggravated detain for advantage: victim: Father Philippos Apostolopoulous.

12On Sunday, 2 March 2008, Paul Akkawi, with Mark Akkawi, and another man, not identified, by arrangement met Tzortzis at a Greek Orthodox Church in Surry Hills. Also present at the meeting was Father Philippos Apostolopoulous, the parish priest of the church. Father Apostolopoulous speaks limited English. Tzortzis had, from time to time, lived at the rectory of the church with Father Apostolopoulous.

13The men discussed the sale of cocaine. Paul Akkawi handed Tzortzis $100,000 in cash. Tzortzis took the money and left the state. He turned off his mobile telephone. Shortly after, he left the country. The applicants and the third man became alarmed when he did not return and they could not contact him. They realised that they had been cheated. One of the men demanded Father Apostolopoulous' mobile phone, which, in fear of violence, he handed over. The men ordered Father Apostolopoulous to go outside. He refused. One of the men raised his shirt, and revealed a pistol. Father Apostolopoulous went outside as directed, in fear for his safety. He was directed to enter a vehicle, which he did. He sat in the back seat. He was crying. The unidentified man was driving the vehicle. It travelled for about 30 minutes. The men shouted at Father Apostolopoulous, telling him not to cry, and not to ask for help. One of them threatened to kill him, and demanded to know where Tzortzis and the money were. They drove him to a home at an unidentified location. He remained in the vehicle, while a number of other males approached. The applicants and the unidentified man drove Father Apostolopoulous to a café. The men ordered Father Apostolopoulous to remain in the vehicle, and not move or talk. The man who had the gun removed it from his shorts and handed it to one of the others.

14The three men walked Father Apostolopoulous across the road to a laneway, where they were met by a group of five or six men. One of them took Father Apostolopoulous by the hand and threatened to cut off his finger if he did not pay the money. Father Apostolopoulous called for help and was told to shut up. The men continued to ask him about the whereabouts of Tzortzis and the money. They walked Father Apostolopoulous back across the road to the café where the applicants and the unidentified man ordered him some food. They left him alone in the café for a time. A Greek speaking man approached and spoke to him. Father Apostolopoulous told him that he had nothing to do with the money. Two of the three men then drove Father Apostolopoulous back to the church and released him. He asked for his telephone and was told ""tomorrow"". The telephone was never returned to him.

15These facts give rise to the first aggravated kidnapping charge. The circumstance of aggravation was that the applicants were in company. The advantage sought to be obtained was the return of the money that Paul Akkawi had given to Tzortzis. The taking of the mobile telephone constituted the first robbery in company offence on each Form 1.

Counts 2 and 3: detain for advantage/robbery in company: victim: Peter Theodossiou; discharge firearm

16Prior to living at the rectory with Father Apostolopoulous, Tzortzis had lived in Belmore with Peter Theodossiou. His car was registered to that address. On the evening of 2 March 2008, Theodossiou was at the home of a Steven Liondos in Canterbury. Father Apostolopoulous telephoned a told him of the events of the day.

17The applicants were able to gain access to information about the address at which Tzortzis' vehicle was registered. Late on 2 March, the applicants and the unidentified man arrived at Liondos' address, and asked where Tzortzis was. Theodossiou said that he did not know. They asked for Tzortzis' telephone number. Theodossiou took out his mobile telephone and searched for the number. One of the men took the phone from him, and one of them scrolled through the numbers recorded in it. They demanded to know where Tzortzis was. Theodossiou said he did not know. He said that Tzortzis lived in Campsie. Mark Akkawi ordered Theodossiou to take the men to the address. One of the men reached into the boot of Theodossiou's car, and removed a number of crowbars. Mark Akkawi and the other man took hold of Theodossiou and walked him down the driveway. They pushed him into a motor vehicle. Theodossiou directed the driver to Tzortzis' apartment in Campsie. They were followed by another vehicle occupied by a number of men. Mark Akkawi left the vehicle for a time (presumably to see if Tzortzis was present in the unit) and returned shortly after. The men drove Theodossiou to a nearby park, where they met the men from the second vehicle. Mark Akkawi opened the door and ordered Theodossiou out. Theodossiou feared for his life; he was very frightened. He asked what the men wanted. He pleaded with Mark Akkawi, and begged not to be harmed. The men ordered him to the park. They demanded information about Tzortzis, and about Tzortzis' parents. One of the men was looking through Theodossiou's telephone, and demanded information about the individuals there listed.

18Paul Akkawi produced a firearm, which he discharged at close range into Theodossiou's leg. The men then ran back to their cars.

19In severe pain, Theodossiou crawled to the street and screamed for help. He was taken to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. He sustained a fractured right femur. He remained in hospital until 18 March.

20The detention of Theodossiou constituted the second aggravated kidnapping offence, committed by both applicants. The circumstance of aggravation again was that the offence was committed in company. The theft of the mobile telephone, which was never returned, constituted the second offence of robbery in company on each Form 1. The shooting of Theodossiou constituted the discharge firearm offence charged against Paul Akkawi. Mark Akkawi was not a party to that offence, and was not charged.

21Evidence of the consequences of the shooting of Theodossiou was given by way of a medical report of an orthopaedic surgeon, dated 29 October 2009, and a Victim Impact Statement made by Theodossiou and signed on 14 April 2010. Dr Boyle, the orthopaedic surgeon, said that the likelihood of complete union of the fracture was good, but risks of malunion, non-union and infection remained. He said there was significant muscle loss which was likely to result in ongoing reduced strength in the lower leg, as well as restriction in range of motion of the knee. The expected time for recovery was 12 to 14 months.

22In his Victim Impact Statement, Theodossiou recorded the events of the evening when he was shot. What follows is a much abbreviated synopsis of a very lengthy statement. Theodossiou said that he believed that he was to be ""executed"" and that he was going to die. He said that, on transfer to hospital, he made ""one desperate phone call"" to his family, telling them what had happened, and asking them to go away and hide. He said that he asked the doctors to ""please save my leg"", and that shortly after he was taken to an operating theatre where a team of five specialist doctors operated on him for seven and a half hours. On regaining consciousness the next day he was in severe pain and had lost a lot of blood. He was shocked to see the condition of his leg. During his time in hospital he lost more than 15 kilograms of body weight and was very weak and fragile. He said that he remained in hospital for a month.

23He said that he had had a career as a professional folkloric dancer, which he believed would come to an end and that he would never be able to dance nearly as well as previously. He also said that he had had a newly commenced business fitting aluminium doors and windows, which demands heavy lifting and strong balance, and that that business was lost to him.

24He said that after his discharge from hospital he went into hiding for many months and did not return home because he was warned that it was too dangerous for him.

25He said that he continues to suffer physically and mentally; he had had a very hard time learning to walk again, to shower and to attend to his personal hygiene. He suffered a lot of pain, numbness and discomfort in his right leg, and also had pain in the left leg.

26He continued to be very frightened. His social life has been significantly detrimentally affected. He is very security-conscious.

27Both applicants were arrested on 29 May 2008, and have remained in custody since that date.

The applicants' personal circumstances

28Although the two applicants are brothers, and were brought up together, and were close, the evidence concerning their personal circumstances has some surprising divergences. Some evidence of their personal circumstances was given by their mother. In respect of each applicant, his Honour had available to him a Pre-Sentence Report prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service, and a psychological report prepared by Dr Katie Seidler (a separate report in respect of each applicant). In respect of each applicant there were a number of testimonials and references. In respect of Paul Akkawi there was additional medical evidence, in particular a report of a psycho-pharmacologist and, one of a psychiatrist, Dr Glenys Dore. Neither applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings.

29I will begin with the evidence concerning Mark Akkawi.



Mark Akkawi

30Mark Akkawi is the younger of the two brothers. He was born in October 1986, and was, as mentioned above, 21 years of age at the time of the offences. He has some criminal history, consisting of motor vehicle offences (one of driving recklessly or furiously or at a speed or in a manner dangerous) and one of conspiracy to steal. In respect of this last offence he was, at the time of the present offences, subject to a bail order made under s 11 of the Sentencing Procedure Act (which section permits a lengthier than usual period of adjournment for the purpose of assessment, or demonstration, of rehabilitation).

31On 28 March 2008, after the present offences, but before his arrest, he was dealt with for this offence by way of a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for 3 years. No other information about this offence was provided.

32Otherwise, evidence of his personal circumstances was given as mentioned above.

33The Probation and Parole officer who signed the Pre-Sentence Report (on 16 October 2009) reported that Mark Akkawi had complied with the conditions of his bail on the conspiracy offence, and had been referred for gambling counselling, with which he had also complied.

34Prior to his arrest, Mark Akkawi was living with his parents and Paul Akkawi. He was attending university, where he was undertaking a Bachelor of Business (Economics and Finance) degree. He gave an account of a family life that was happy and positive. His mother, who also provided information to the Probation and Parole officer, described him as ""well-balanced"" and ""family oriented"", but ""highly strung"" and prone to anxiety.

35He has had no reported problems with alcohol or other drugs, but has had a problem with gambling. He had been referred for counselling. At the time of the preparation of the report, he acknowledged that he continued to gamble occasionally but claimed that he did not do so at a level that caused financial stress. He had had to call on his mother to pay some gambling debts.

36The Probation and Parole officer considered him to be a young man of considerable talent, with potential to make a positive contribution to society. At that time, Mark Akkawi had been in custody for 18 months. An updated report, dated 15 April 2010, when he had been in custody almost two years, confirmed that he had been charged with no internal offences. As a result of internal transfers, he found it difficult to become settled and engage in services provided by the Department of Corrective Services. He had completed an anger management program.

37The psychological report was prepared by Dr Katie Seidler, who assessed Mark Akkawi on 10 November 2009. She took a history of his early life similar to that of the Probation and Parole officer, of a stable and supportive family environment, with no abuse, neglect, financial stringency or social disadvantage.

38Mark Akkawi described a particularly close relationship with his mother, but also was very positive about the dynamics with his father. (The significance of this will become apparent when I come to the personal circumstances of Paul Akkawi.) Although Mark Akkawi reported that he began using alcohol at the age of 15, and sometimes engaged in binge drinking, this was seen by Dr Seidler as ""fairly conventional late adolescent and early adult"" recreational behaviour. However, Dr Seidler also recorded that he had begun gambling at about 15 years of age and soon became addicted. She considered that his gambling remained an issue to be addressed.

39In addition, Dr Seidler took a history of anxiety dating back to Mark Akkawi's late adolescent or early adult years, anxiety which worsened in the context of the stress associated with problem gambling. He also described mild and transitory symptoms of depressed mood, but this was not seen by Dr Seidler as being at a clinical level. 

40Dr Seidler noted that Mark Akkawi had expressed regret for his behaviour, but she considered this to be ""generally self-focussed"" and that he continued to harbour anger and resentment towards Tzortzis for stealing Paul Akkawi's money. He told Dr Seidler that his offending was motivated by the desire to support his brother.

41Notwithstanding her expressed reservations, Dr Seidler considered Mark Akkawi to be ""a young man with positive future potential ..."".

42Because of the history of anxiety, Dr Seidler considered that Mark Akkawi would benefit from psychological intervention designed to boost him in developing skills better to understand and manage that condition. She retained concern about his gambling. 

43The testimonials were universally positive and expressed surprise at the involvement of Mark Akkawi in these offences.

Paul Akkawi

44Paul Akkawi was born in November 1984 and was 23 years of age at the time of the offences. He also had some criminal history, including three convictions for driving whilst his licence was suspended, one of trespass, one of receiving motor vehicle parts, and one of offensive language.

45The authors of all of the reports in his case recorded a noticeably different family history, or, perhaps more accurately, a noticeably different perception in Paul Akkawi as to the circumstances of his childhood and adolescence from that of his brother. To the author of the Pre-Sentence Report, Paul Akkawi described ""a significant lack of parental guidance as a child"". He said that his father travelled a lot for work, and had significant gambling issues. As a result of the gambling, in 1994 ""the family went bankrupt"", and his mother was forced to return to work to provide for the family. This was not mentioned in the histories taken in respect of Mark Akkawi. Paul Akkawi's mother confirmed the absence of the applicant's father from the home during Paul Akkawi's formative years. She described Paul Akkawi as a nervous and ""unsettled"" child. She reported behavioural problems from a very young age. Although Paul Akkawi reported that his father could be very loving, he also reported that he used physical forms of discipline (something confirmed by his mother), sometimes to a level Paul Akkawi saw as excessive and abusive. When he was 18, Paul Akkawi was sent to Lebanon to live with relatives for a year. 

46Paul Akkawi was described as intelligent, sufficiently so to be included in programmes for gifted children. However, he was also disruptive and aggressive, eventually culminating in expulsion from at least one school. In 2007, when he was 22, he completed a bridging programme through which he earned admission to a Media and Communications Course at the University of NSW. He was in the first semester of that course when he was arrested in relation to the present offences.

47The Probation and Parole officer recorded concerns about Paul Akkawi's behaviour from an early age, with anxiety attacks, and a suggestion of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. However, out of resistance by Paul Akkawi and his mother to medication, this issue was not pursued. (Further detail will appear in the context of the psychiatric evidence.)

48Paul Akkawi developed a gambling addiction at about age 16. He did not gamble during his year in Lebanon, but resumed on his return to Australia.

49In 2007 Paul Akkawi suffered multiple losses with the deaths, in quick succession, of three grandparents, and his mother's move to Dubai.

50Dr Seidler took a similar history. She found Paul Akkawi to be ""a thoughtful, eloquent and reflective person, who has some insight"". He described to her a ""somewhat different"", [from that described by his brother] upbringing repeating his account of his father's absences, his gambling, and the financial losses of 1994. He reported a very close relationship with his mother.

51Paul Akkawi believed that, as a result of his gambling losses, his father suffered from depression for several years, as a result of which he (Paul Akkawi) was forced to take on additional family responsibility.

52He began using alcohol at about 15 years of age; this escalated and he was a heavy consumer of alcohol for a period thereafter.

53He also reported to Dr Seidler a long list of mental health concerns, including:

""constant and debilitating anxiety that has been both distressing and causing functional impairment in a number of domains"".

Dr Seidler reported more recent concerns that Paul Akkawi may suffer from bi-polar disorder, with paranoid ideation. She considered that his reported symptoms were most consistent with a mood disorder, but also clearly prominent were features of anxiety and paranoid personality profile.

54Although she administered psychometric tests, she found the results invalid, suggesting an exaggerated and implausible response, which could be attributed either to malingering, or to a disordered and dysfunctional state where he was giving a ""cry for help"". In the light of his clinical presentation, Dr Seidler favoured the latter explanation.

55As a result of Dr Seidler's comprehensive report, Paul Akkawi was referred to the psychiatrist, Dr Dore. Dr Dore recorded a similar history again, including the gambling, and very heavy alcohol consumption at the age of 18.

56After a telephone consultation with Paul Akkawi's mother, as well as a lengthy interview with Paul Akkawi, Dr Dore provisionally diagnosed bi-polar disorder, with paranoid personality traits. These conditions appear to have existed since childhood.

57In an important finding, Dr Dore said:

""It appears likely he was mentally ill at the time the crimes were committed, with an unstable mood disorder and abnormally high levels of anxiety and agitation. It is my impression that his judgment was impaired by mental illness, and that he acted in a manner that was uncharacteristic for him.""

The Remarks on Sentence

58Colefax DCJ recounted the relevant facts and circumstances of the offences in a manner that has not attracted criticism.

59He noted that there was no Victim Impact Statement provided in relation to Father Apostolopoulous, and therefore no evidence that he had suffered any emotional distress additional to that that would ordinarily be expected following such a serious crime. He noted, in some detail, the lengthy Victim Impact Statement provided by Mr Theodossiou, as well as the medical reports. It is not necessary to restate what was therein contained.

60He found, in relation to Mark Akkawi, that three circumstances aggravated the offence. The first was that each offence was committed in the victim's home; the second was the use of the firearm in each offence (excluding the separate offence constituted by the discharge, by Paul Akkawi, of the firearm); and the third that the offences were committed whilst on conditional liberty.

61The first and second of these applied equally to Paul Akkawi, the third did not.

62Colefax DCJ expressly rejected a submission made on behalf of Mark Akkawi that he ought to be treated more leniently than his brother because his role was ""subsidiary"" to that of Paul Akkawi. He considered that Mark Akkawi played ""a prominent role"" in the kidnapping of each victim. He found that, apart from the aggravating factor that Mark Akkawi was on conditional liberty, each applicant was equally culpable.

63Later, specifically considering the issue of parity, he said:

""Parity is a significant issue in this case. Although Paul Akkawi is the older brother and appears to have been the moving force in obtaining the money which was given to Mr Tzortzis and negotiating the purpose of the transaction, I have already found that his brother Mark was not playing a subsidiary role in the circumstances of the kidnapping. Moreover, he was on conditional liberty at the time of the offences.""

64His Honour considered a submission that, excluding the shooting of Mr Theodossiou, the second offence was more serious than the first; he concluded that, if it were so, it was not by a greatly significant margin. In each case, the victim felt that his life was at risk; the applicants intended to terrorise the victims for the purpose of extracting information from them. While Father Apostolopoulous was threatened with physical mutilation (the threat to cut off his finger) and shown a gun, (suggesting that a more serious offence might be committed against him), that offence occurred in daylight hours; the offence against Mr Theodossiou took place after dark. Father Apostolopoulous was returned to the rectory; Mr Theodossiou was left abandoned and bleeding (and, I would add, seriously injured) in a dark and lonely place.

65Notwithstanding the view expressed by the judge, the sentences imposed reflect a not insignificant differential, perhaps attributable principally to the fact that the offence against Mr Theodossiou was a second offence.

66In relation to the question of accumulation of sentences, his Honour said:

""Although each of the offences was a separate act of criminality involving at least, in the cases of the kidnappings, two separate victims, the concept of totality requires there should be partial accumulation of the sentences."" (AB 30)

67His Honour turned to the personal circumstances of each applicant, dealing first with Paul Akkawi. His relatively brief observations focussed upon Paul Akkawi's serious problem with alcohol and gambling and what was subsequently disclosed concerning his psychiatric condition. He said:

""It is clear on the material that Paul Akkawi's gambling has been directly attributed to his offending behaviour and his gambling is a product of his psychiatric disorder. Now that the condition has been diagnosed, there are good prospects of successful treatment and for consequential rehabilitation, which in my view would be enhanced by a longer period on parole.

It was submitted by senior counsel for the offender that the shooting was apparently spontaneous and probably a consequence of the then undiagnosed mental illness of Paul Akkawi, to which I have just referred. That may be accepted. But a gun was taken to the park and indeed had been in the possession of two members of the original group of three for all of the afternoon. It was used in circumstances described by senior counsel for the offender as, 'a significant crime' involving, 'the shooting of a man, an unarmed man, a terrified man who had been kidnapped, shooting him in the leg once'. Accordingly, while this offender, because of his psychiatric illness, might not be an appropriate vehicle for the unqualified application of the principles of general deterrence, nevertheless, considerations of specific deterrence assume greater importance."" (AB 28-29)

68He then considered the personal circumstances of Mark Akkawi, noting, first, his age (21 years at offence, almost 24 years at sentencing), his significant gambling problem and ""short, but relevant, criminal history"". He noted that his offence was committed at a time when he was on conditional liberty.

69He accepted a concession made on behalf of the Crown that each applicant had demonstrated relevant and genuine remorse, not limited to the pleas of guilty. 

70He determined to reduce each sentence by 15% by reason of the pleas of guilty, and made the finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, to which I have already referred.

71He proceeded to impose the sentences set out above.

The grounds of the application

72Three grounds of appeal were proposed in respect of Mark Akkawi. They were pleaded as follows:

""1. The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentence imposed on his co-accused.

2. The sentence is manifestly excessive.

3. The sentencing judge erred in failing to structure the sentences imposed so as to give proper effect to his finding of special circumstances.""

73In respect of Paul Akkawi, two grounds of appeal were proposed, as follows:

""1. His Honour erred when setting the aggregate non-parole period by failing to give proper effect to a finding of special circumstances.

2. His Honour erred by finding that specific deterrence assumed greater effect as a result of the applicant's psychiatric illness.""

74I will deal firstly with the application made by Mark Akkawi.




Mark Akkawi
Ground 1: Parity

75Under the first ground, the applicant takes issue with the rejection by Colefax DCJ of the submission that his role was subsidiary to that of Paul Akkawi. Two particular matters were advanced in support of that challenge. They were that the purpose of the detention was tied to the activities and interests of Paul Akkawi and therefore should not bear upon the culpability of Mark Akkawi to the same degree; and that his Honour failed to take into account the relative ages of the two applicants.

76In support of the first proposition, reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in Williams v R; Saunders v R [2006] NSWCCA 33, per Hall J (with whom Basten JA and Howie J agreed). At [53], Hall J said that a finding made by the sentencing judge in that case concerning the reason or purpose for that offence was relevant both to objective seriousness and relative culpability of the two co-offenders. As is plain even from that brief synopsis, that was a finding made in respect of the particular circumstances of that case. Put briefly, Williams had been recruited to assist Saunders, who had already detained the victim, after the victim had broken into Saunders' premises and, as a result, a marijuana crop being grown by Saunders had been discovered by police. I do not read anything in the passages of the judgment of Hall J to which reference was made that operates as any statement of principle that could be translated to the present case.

77The same applies to a decision of my own relied upon by the Crown to supposed contrary effect. That is the decision in Thomson v R; Moody v R [2010] NSWCCA 124. First, with respect to this point, my judgment was a minority decision; second, the remarks were made in the context of a joint criminal enterprise in which roles had been allocated to various participants. There I expressed the view that it was not readily apparent that the role of one offender could be distinguished from that of another merely on the basis of what he or she did. I emphasised that each case would depend on its own facts. The Crown's submission was that, in circumstances where the offences were not pre-planned, and were, in effect, spontaneous, the allocation of roles, to which I referred to in Johnson and Moody, is not material. The submission is valid.

78Accordingly, I find little assistance in the authorities to which the court was referred in the determination of this issue.

79However, it seems to me that there is some substance in the complaint made on behalf of Mark Akkawi, and there is some merit in the proposition that because the two kidnapping offences were committed in order to extricate Paul Akkawi from the predicament into which he found himself, first by gambling his mother's money, and second by giving what remained of it to Tzortzis, his culpability ought to be seen as greater. Moreover, the evidence establishes that Paul Akkawi was the older, and dominant, brother.

80In my opinion, the relative positions of the two applicants called for some, if not great, differentiation.

81There is therefore some, although limited, substance in this ground of the application.

Ground 2: Manifest excess

82The complaint made under this heading is directed both to the individual sentences imposed, and to the degree of accumulation (two years), resulting, so it was argued, in a manifestly excessive aggregate sentence.

83Reliance was placed upon statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of NSW to support the submission. The statistics show that the range of sentences imposed for s 86(2)(a) offences is 18 months to 7 years. After a plea of guilty, the highest head sentence, of 6 years, was imposed in 15% of cases. (For the purpose of considering this ground, the applicant's head sentence in respect of the first count ought to be treated as 6 years.) Having regard to the circumstances of the first offence, I would not be disposed to find that that sentence was outside the range legitimately available.

84The statistics would suggest that the sentence imposed in respect of the second count (6 years, 9 months and 16 days) is outside and well above the upper range of head sentences previously imposed. Only 4% of offenders, after pleading guilty, had been sentenced to such a term.

85The limitations on the use that can be made of sentencing statistics are well known. Most recently, the High Court has endorsed the proposition that they stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence (to which I would add, on appeal, an imposed sentence): Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [54].

86Taken alone the statistics would suggest that such a sentence is above the range of those that have, as a matter of history, been imposed. But it must be remembered that this offence was committed immediately after the first offence, it began at the victim's home, was committed after dark, and in circumstances where the applicants had recruited a considerable body of supported. And the victim was abandoned, seriously injured, in a dark place. I am unable to find that the second sentence was outside the range legitimately available.

87I do, however, consider that, while some accumulation was required, the degree was in itself excessive, and resulted in an aggregate sentence that does not withstand the scrutiny of being measured against the yardstick of historical sentences. I would reduce the accumulation to one year.

Ground 3: Special Circumstances

88It is apparent from the extracts from the Remarks on Sentence above that a significant reason for the finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act was the benefit to be obtained by both applicants of a longer than normal period on parole. In each individual sentence, the non-parole period was therefore reduced to a little over 60% of the head sentence. That is a significant reduction on the statutory proportion of 75%.

89However, as often happens where sentences are accumulated, a good deal of the benefit was lost as a result of the accumulation. The proportion of the overall non-parole period to the overall head sentence is just under 70%: a quite minor reduction.

90I would accept that this did not reflect the sentencing judge's intention.

91For this reason only the sentences imposed on Mark Akkawi must be reviewed, and set aside. It will be necessary to re-sentence.

Paul Akkawi

Ground 1: Special Circumstances

92In this case, the departure from the judge's stated intention is even more marked. The overall non-parole period is reduced from 75% of the head sentence by only 8 days - 74.89%, on the Crown's calculations.

93Although the Crown argued that no error has been demonstrated, and that the sentencing judge had reserved judgment prior to imposing sentence and had given careful thought to the structure of the sentences and the principle of totality, he could not argue against the proposition that he had expressly stated his intention of providing for a longer period on parole.

94I am satisfied that this ground is made out.



Ground 2: Psychiatric Illness

95The complaint under this ground is directed to that passage in the Remarks on Sentence in which his Honour, while relegating considerations of general deterrence to a position of lesser importance, held that ""considerations of specific deterrence assume greater importance.""

96In my opinion, this ground is made out. It is of some importance, as, amongst other things, his Honour said this applicant, having been diagnosed correctly, is susceptible to treatment that will alleviate his problems. This finding impacts significantly upon the need for specific deterrence.

97The authorities in relation to the effect of psychiatric illness on sentencing are well known: see, for example, the analysis and review of authorities in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228; R v Israil [2002] NSW CCA 255. In particular, where the psychiatric illness is causally related to the offending behaviour, allowance may be made in recognition of that fact. It is here that the finding of Dr Dore, extracted above ([57]), is of importance. Further, as observed by the sentencing judge, psychiatric illness may justify giving reduced weight to questions of general deterrence.

98In my opinion, insufficient weight was given to Paul Akkawi's psychiatric illness, particularly in respect of its relevance to questions of specific deterrence. Given the judge's acceptance that treatment of Paul Akkawi's condition would render him unlikely to offend again, it was an error to emphasise specific deterrence.

99It follows that, in each case, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and re-sentence the applicant.

100I propose that the applicants be re-sentenced as follows:


Mark Akkawi:

Count 1: imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months, commencing on 29 May 2008 and expiring on 28 November 2013, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months, expiring on 28 August 2011;

Count 2: (taking into account the Form 1 offences) imprisonment for 6 years, commencing on 29 May 2009 and expiring on 28 May 2015, with a non-parole period of 4 years, expiring on 28 May 2013.

That is an aggregate sentence for 7 years, commencing on 29 May 2008 and expiring on 28 May 2015, with a non-parole period of 5 years, expiring on 28 May 2013.

Paul Akkawi:

Count 1: imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months, commencing on 29 May 2008 and expiring on 28 November 2013, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months, expiring on 28 August 2011.

Count 2: imprisonment for 6 years, commencing on 29 May 2009 and expiring on 28 May 2015, with a non-parole period of 4 years, expiring on 28 May 2013;

Count 3: (taking into account the Form 1 offences) imprisonment for 6 years, commencing on 29 August 2011 and expiring on 28 August 2017, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, expiring on 28 May 2014.

The aggregate is a sentence of imprisonment for 9 years and 3 months commencing on 29 May 2008 and expiring on 28 August 2017, with a non-parole period of 6 years, expiring on 28 May 2014.

Although I have found above that Mark Akkawi was less morally culpable than his brother, that finding is balanced by Paul Akkawi's mental illness. Accordingly, the sentences I propose in respect of the aggravated kidnapping offences are identical.

I have structured the sentences so as to achieve of the objective of implementing the finding of special circumstances in order to provide lengthier periods on parole.

101I add one observation concerning the sentences imposed at first instance. In my opinion, the form of sentencing here undertaken (at first instance) is not to be encouraged. By this I refer to the imposition of sentences composed of years, months and days.

102I assume that this was done in order to apply the reduction in sentence of 15% referrable to the pleas of guilty. However, it is conducive to error, both at first instance and on appeal. In my opinion, justice is better achieved by the conventional means of sentencing in round figures. There is nothing in R v Thomson; R v Houlton that requires a mathematical approach of the precision here demonstrated.

103BLANCH J: I agree with Simpson J.

104ROTHMAN J: I agree with Simpson J

		16 April 2013",2012-02-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708617,Jaime Felipe PAREDES v R [2012] NSWCCA 4,"Judgment 

1MEAGHER JA: I agree with Rothman J for the reasons he gives that leave to appeal should be granted and that the appeal against sentence be dismissed. 

2HOEBEN J: I agree with Rothman J. 

3ROTHMAN J: Jaime Felipe Paredes was charged with knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely, methylamphetamine, approximately, but less than, 1 kg and not less than a commercial quantity. The date of the offence was between 26 February 2008 and 28 March 2008. Mr Paredes pleaded guilty (on the first day of trial) and was sentenced by Freeman DCJ on 18 March 2011. 

4Mr Paredes was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing on 27 March 2008, with a balance of term of a further three years to expire on 26 September 2015. Mr Paredes seeks to appeal on the sole ground of lack of parity with co-offenders. 

Facts 

5As already stated, Mr Paredes pleaded guilty on the first day of trial. Notwithstanding the plea of guilty (or because of it) there was, thereafter, a factual contest in relation to that which was to form the basis for sentencing. 

6An appeal based upon lack of parity assumes, at least for the purpose of that argument, that no other error, identifiable or manifest, is disclosed by the remarks on sentence or the outcome of the exercise of discretion by the sentencing judge. Of necessity, that requires an acceptance of the findings of fact by the sentencing judge, except, perhaps, on the question of the relative culpability of the co-offenders. The applicant, through his counsel, expressly conceded the correctness of the facts set out in the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence. 

7The sentence proceedings in relation to each of the relevant co-offenders were conducted at the same time. His Honour sentenced each of the co-offenders (except Gustavo Araya, who was sentenced approximately 1 month later) also at the same time. 

8Because of the nature of the hearing on sentence, his Honour spent a substantial part of his remarks on sentence dealing with the disputed facts. Those findings of fact occupy 100 paragraphs of his Honour's remarks. Notwithstanding their apparent length, the findings of fact are a concise summary of the evidence adduced before his Honour and his Honour's conclusions in relation to that evidence. 

9The parties before this Court accept the following summary, which is taken, largely, from the submissions on behalf of Mr Paredes. 

10Mr Paredes, together with two co-offenders, Mr Barillaro and Mr Donevski, pleaded guilty to certain drug offences. The pleas were very late. In broad terms, an informer, ""Mr X"", introduced an undercover officer to the co-offender Mr Donevski. Mr X encouraged Mr Donevski to become involved in the supply to the undercover officer. 

11In due course, Mr Donevski supplied one half of an ounce of methylamphetamine in return for a payment of $4,000. This occurred on 12 March 2008. Mr Donevski agreed to supply approximately 1 kg of methylamphetamine on 27 March 2008. The half an ounce was considered a sample. 

12No money or drugs were exchanged on 27 March 2008. In substance, the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine was committed by agreeing to supply or attempting to arrange the supply of the methylamphetamine. It was not delivered. 

13Mr Donevski and a fourth offender, Mr Araya, were arrested at the scene on 27 March 2008 and Mr Paredes was arrested later that night. The co-offender Mr Barillaro was arrested on 3 April 2008. 

14Having been introduced to the undercover agent by Mr X, Mr Donevski agreed to supply the drug and obtained a sample from Mr Barillaro. Mr Donevski, having agreed to supply the undercover officer, then sought to obtain the drugs to complete the transaction. He did this through Mr Barillaro. Mr Barillaro provided the sample of half an ounce after shopping around to seek the most favourable price. Mr Donevski had agreed to supply the undercover officer with the kilogram (approximately) for a price of $280,000. 

15Mr Paredes, who was in financial difficulties, was involved in the search for a supplier in order that Mr Donevski's proposed supply could proceed. The sentencing judge heard evidence of telephone calls between all three of Mr Donevski, Mr Barillaro and Mr Paredes. In the course of those telephone calls, Mr Paredes informed the undercover officer of the difficulties he was having with the end supplier. The sentencing judge reached the conclusion that Mr Paredes was ""intimately involved"" in the supply from ""a time before the provision of the sample"". 

16The Crown, in its submissions, draws attention, in particular, to paragraphs [79]-[106] of his Honour's remarks. I will repeat some of that passage: 

""[79] Paredes accepts by his plea that he was a participant in the supply but his evidence is directed to establishing that such participation came very late, was peripheral and in effective and was brought about only because of fears he felt for the safety of his friend Donevski and, indeed, for his own and his family's well-being. He said that he was not to gain any monetary benefit for himself. 

[80] The evidentiary burden of establishing these propositions, on the balance of probability, rests on the offender. 

[81] In giving evidence, Paredes asserted that he knew nothing about the supply with which he is charged until mid day on 26 March 2008, that is the day before the delivery of 1 kg of methylamphetamine was scheduled to take place. Specifically, he denied any knowledge of the actual supply of a half ounce of methylamphetamine as a sample which had taken place on 12 March 2008. 

[82] I do not accept that he was unaware of the supply on 12 March 2008.... 
... 
[102] Paredes is not a witness I was prepared to accept. I do accept that Paredes was in financial difficulties, for example, attempting to sell his laptop computer.... 
... 
[106] The conclusion I have reached is that Paredes was intimately involved in the supply from a time before the provision of the sample"". 


Principles on Parity 

17The principles applicable to the application of parity in sentencing are well known. They were extensively summarised by Campbell JA in Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 (with whom Howie J and I agreed) and the judgment of Campbell JA was cited with approval by the High Court in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49. 

18In Green & Quinn, supra, the High Court reaffirmed, in the context of the Crown appeal, the importance of the principle and its underlying philosophical basis in the doctrine of equal justice. The majority in the High Court (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) said: 

""[28] ""Equal justice"" embodies the norm expressed in the term ""equality before the law"". It is an aspect of the rule of law. It was characterised by Kelsen as ""the principle of legality, of lawfulness, which is immanent in every legal order."" It has been called ""the starting point of all other liberties."" It applies to the interpretation of statutes and thereby to the exercise of statutory powers. It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen : 

""Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect."" (emphasis in original) 

Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is ""a reflection of the notion of equal justice"" and ""is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice"". It finds expression in the ""parity principle"" which requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. As with the norm of ""equal justice"", which is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances. 

[29] General concepts of ""systematic fairness"" and ""reasonable consistency"" in sentencing, as an aspect of the administration of federal criminal justice, were discussed in Hili v The Queen . They apply to persons charged with similar offences arising out of unrelated events. The consistency they require is ""consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles, not some numerical or mathematical equivalence."" That kind of general consistency is maintained by the decisions of intermediate courts of appeal. The consistency required by the parity principle is focussed on the particular case. It applies to the punishment of ""co-offenders"", albeit the limits of that term have not been defined with precision. 
 
[30] In Lowe v The Queen and in Postiglione v the Queen , this Court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise. Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged. The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v The Queen , there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged."" 
[references omitted] 
 
19As is clear from an application of the principles relating to parity in sentencing, like offenders should be treated alike and a difference in sentence should reflect rationally the difference between offenders, either in objective or subjective circumstances. Ultimately, the principle is engaged on appeal when there is, objectively, a justifiable sense of grievance because of the disparity in sentence suffered by an appellant (or applicant for appeal) compared to the sentence imposed on the co-offenders. 

20It is the foregoing test that Mr Paredes must satisfy in order to succeed in his appeal. 

Consideration 

21Best practice dictates that the same sentencing judge should, where possible, sentence co-offenders ( Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R (2011) 205 A Crim R 274 at [33] - [43], [46]; see also R v Nguyen; R v Pham (2010) 205 A Crim R 106 at [13], [24]; Gurney v R; Willetts v R [2011] NSWCCA 48 at [81]; Rae v R [2011] NSWCCA 211 at [50] - [55]; Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227 at [77] - [78]). In that way all of the considerations relevant to each of the co-offenders are known and are able to be taken into account in determining any appropriate relativity. Further, in those circumstances, differences in findings of fact can be minimised or accommodated. Sometimes, inevitably, because of the difference in burden of proof, there will, even before the same sentencing judge, be a different factual matrix for each offender. That is not the situation here. 

22Freeman DCJ came to a conclusion, expressed at [135] of his remarks on sentence, that the sentences for each of the three offenders should be ""roughly the same, except for an allowance for Donevski's slightly reduced capacity and, of course, a mathematical adjustment to counter the fact that Barillaro has served only seven months and has been on strict bail conditions for two years and five months"". 

23The sentences imposed on Mr Donevski and Mr Barillaro, respectively, were a non-parole period of four years with an additional term of three years and a non-parole period of three years and three months with an additional term of three years. None of the offenders had any charges on a Form 1 except Mr Donevski whose Form 1 offence was described as having only a minor effect on the sentence. 

24The roles played by each were similar. Mr Donevski was said to have a greater physical involvement than the others but lacked apparent authority (Remarks at [112]), whereas Mr Barillaro was described as the ""classic middle man"" (Remarks at [20]) and, as already stated, Mr Paredes was intimately involved in the supply from the time before provision of the sample. 

25Mr Donevski suffered from a mental illness, which lessened the weight to be given to general deterrence but he was not a user of drugs. On the other hand, Mr Paredes suffered psychological problems arising from a broken home (Remarks at [129]) and was an abuser of alcohol and cannabis who had been the subject of psychiatric treatment over a number of years (Remarks at [132]). Mr Barillaro suffered depression for which he was ""self-medicating"" with cannabis. Each had prior criminal history, which obviously differed, but Mr Paredes seemed to have the slightly more serious prior criminal history. 

26Each of the offenders was married with dependents. Mr Barillaro has six children and will, as a consequence of these offences, lose his house. Mr Donevski has a son and ailing mother. 

27The sentencing judge conceded that Mr Paredes had good prospects of rehabilitation but qualified his contrition because of his attempt to minimise his involvement in the scheme (Remarks at [133]). 

28Leaving aside the adjustment for Mr Barillaro's period of incarceration of seven months (and making some allowance for the restrictive bail conditions under which he operated for the remainder of the period) the sentence imposed upon him is not significantly different from that imposed upon Mr Paredes (being a difference of six months to accommodate the restricted liberty caused by bail conditions for almost two and a half years). 

29The Court notes that Mr Donevski was sentenced to a six-month shorter non-parole period, which was to take account of the mental illness factors affecting the commission of the offence, to which his Honour referred. Mr Paredes completes his sentence earlier than each co-offender. 

30Sentencing is an exercise of discretion and can be interfered with only on one of the well-known bases to which the High Court referred in House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 . That a judge of this Court may, if sentencing at first instance, have imposed a different sentence does not justify, of itself, interference with the sentence imposed. In my view, there is no justifiable sense of grievance, objectively determined. His Honour, in sentencing, noted the differences between the offenders and fixed sentences accordingly. 

31The ground of appeal should fail and I propose that the Court make the following orders: 
(i)   Leave to appeal granted;
(ii)  Appeal dismissed.

2708618,Telesto Investments Ltd & ors v UBS AG [2012] NSWSC 44,"Judgment 

1HER HONOUR: Before me for hearing on 21 November 2011 was an application by the defendant (UBS AG), by notice of motion filed on 24 October 2011, for a permanent stay of proceedings commenced in this Court on 2 November 2010 by the respondents to the motion (to whom I will refer collectively as the Telesto parties). These proceedings have not yet progressed to the stage where a Commercial List Response has been filed, there having been a temporary stay in place pending the outcome of the present application. 

2The stay of proceedings is sought pursuant to s 67 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) or the Court's inherent or implied power to control its own processes and procedure, having regard to the existence of separate proceedings in Singapore between the same parties in which an anti-suit injunction was granted against the Telesto parties restraining ( inter alia ) the continuation of proceedings such as the present proceedings and in which at the same time an application by the Telesto parties for a stay of the Singapore proceedings was dismissed. 

3UBS AG seeks the stay on four grounds, which it concedes are to a certain extent overlapping: 

(i) as a matter of comity (on the basis that the continued prosecution of these proceedings is in defiance of the subsisting anti-suit injunction granted in Singapore); 

(ii) on the basis of an issue estoppel following the dismissal by the High Court of Singapore of the application by the Telesto parties for a stay of the Singapore proceedings (which issue estoppel is said to preclude the Telesto parties from contending in the present proceedings that Singapore is not the appropriate forum for this dispute or that it is not vexatious or oppressive for them to continue to prosecute the present proceedings); 

(iii) if (contrary to UBS AG's contention) there is not an issue estoppel in the strict sense, then on the basis that it is an abuse of process for the Telesto parties to seek to re-litigate in this Court the forum non conveniens issues which have already been determined in Singapore; and 

(iv) that (if it is open to the Telesto parties to re-litigate the forum non conveniens issues) the continuation of these proceedings would be vexatious and oppressive having regard to the controversy as a whole. 

Summary 

4For the reasons set out below, I am of the view that: 

(i) the principles of comity do not require the grant of a permanent stay of the proceedings in this Court, although the principles of comity warrant due recognition being given (in determining whether a stay should be granted) to the exercise of judicial power in Singapore in granting the subsisting anti-suit injunction; 

(ii) while I consider that there is an issue estoppel which precludes the Telesto parties from contending in the present proceedings that it is not vexatious or oppressive for them to continue to prosecute the present proceedings, in the sense in which those terms were used in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited [1990] HCA 55, I do not consider that this is determinative of the issue as to whether a stay should be granted; 

(iii) it would be an abuse of process for the Telesto parties to seek to re-litigate in this Court the forum non conveniens issues which have already been determined in Singapore, subject to the qualification that where matters have subsequently come to light which may affect the conclusions that would be reached in relation to that issue then there is no such abuse of process; further, where there is at this stage only the prospect that the same issues will be required to be determined in the substantive proceedings in each jurisdiction I am not satisfied that there is an abuse of process in the maintenance of the present proceedings (in contrast with the position that would apply if the present proceedings were seeking in substance to re-litigate issues already decided in the Singapore proceedings); and 

(iv) having considered the factors to be taken into account on a forum non conveniens application in this jurisdiction, if the Singapore proceedings will involve the determination of the issues raised in these proceedings in relation to the alleged misleading and deceptive conduct or misrepresentation in relation to the acquisition of investments for the Telesto account (and related issues) then the continuation of these proceedings would be vexatious and oppressive having regard to the controversy as a whole; however, I am not satisfied that there will necessarily be such an overlap any longer in circumstances where the Singapore proceedings are now confined to the claims for declaratory relief and indemnity costs (and whether there is such an overlap will largely be dependent on the course that the Telesto parties now take in relation to their defence of the Singapore proceedings). 

5In those circumstances, in the exercise of my discretion I consider it would be appropriate to grant a temporary stay of the present proceedings pending the outcome of the claim by UBS AG in the Singapore proceedings for declaratory relief and indemnity costs. 

6If the claim for declaratory relief is determined in favour of UBS AG then that may (as UBS AG contends) dispose of all the issues in the present proceedings by virtue of a res judicata issue estoppel or an Anshun estoppel (though it is not appropriate for me at this stage to express any view on this). If the claim for declaratory relief is unsuccessful, then whether the maintenance of the present proceedings is vexatious or oppressive at that point will depend in my view on the scope of the matters litigated in the Singapore proceedings in its defence (and the overlap between those and the matters sought to be litigated in the present proceedings), subject to any argument that UBS AG might then raise as to the consequence of what has or has not been pleaded or put in issue by way of defence in those proceedings (and the prospect of an Anshun estoppel claim there springs to mind). 

7I will, however, hear submissions as to the event upon which the termination of the temporary stay should be conditioned as it may be that the stay need not remain in place beyond some different point in the conduct of the Singapore proceedings. 

Background Facts 

8The background to the present dispute is canvassed in the reasons for judgment handed down by Chong J in the High Court of Singapore ([2011] SGHC 170) on 14 July 2011 dismissing the Telesto parties' appeals against the grant of the anti-suit injunction and the dismissal of their stay application. Senior Counsel for UBS AG, Mr Stoljar SC, appearing with Mr Livingston of Counsel, notes that the factual findings made by his Honour have not been challenged by the Telesto parties (an appeal from his Honour's judgment having been dismissed for want of appearance by the Telesto parties). 

9The first plaintiff (Telesto), described by Chong J at para [5] of his reasons as an underlying company of the Dog Star Trust (a purpose trust registered in Jersey in the Channel Islands), is incorporated in Jersey. 

10Mr Tyne (the second plaintiff in the present proceedings and a defendant in the Singapore proceedings) is a director (said at [6] of his Honour's reasons to be the controlling mind) of Pole Star Funds Management Pty Ltd, an Australian company through which Mr Tyne controlled the investments of Telesto. (Pole Star was described by Chong J in the Singapore proceedings as being, at all material times, in charge of Telesto's discretionary investment and the sole beneficial owner of the assets in Telesto's account with UBS AG). 

11An ASIC search in respect of Pole Star records Mr Tyne's address as director of the company as an address in the United Kingdom, that also being the address disclosed to UBS AG as Mr Tyne's address in the Guarantee. At least having regard to what seems to have transpired when attempts were made to serve Court documents in the Singapore proceedings on Mr Tyne at a Queensland address in late 2010, it appears that Mr Tyne is not infrequently overseas. However, Senior Counsel for the Telesto parties, Mr Stitt QC, has noted that Mr Tyne is currently resident in Australia. 

12Mr Tyne was described by Chong J (at [8]) as the common denominator of Telesto, Pole Star and the entity which is the third plaintiff in the present proceedings (to which I will refer, consistently with the terminology adopted by Chong J, as ""Argot""). Argot is a company incorporated in Australia and the corporate trustee of the Argot Unit Trust. At [8] of his Honour's reasons, Chong J notes that Mr Tyne was at all material times the director of Argot and the sole beneficial owner of the assets held in Argot's (separate) account with the Singapore branch of UBS AG (opened in 2010). 

13UBS AG is a financial institution which carries on business in Singapore (and elsewhere) as a banker. Telesto opened an investment account with the Singapore branch of UBS AG on 3 December 2007. 

14From December 2007, Telesto entered into various facility arrangements with UBS AG, pursuant to which UBS AG made funds available to Telesto for the purpose of the purchase of various investments through Telesto's account with UBS AG (those facilities being a short term overdraft facility with a limit, as increased, of USD60 million; an Exchange Traded Derivative Trading Facility with a limit of USD100,000 and an OTC Foreign Exchange and Precious Metal Derivatives Trading Facility with a similar limit as the Exchange Traded Derivatives Facility). The respective facilities were put in place by the acceptance by Telesto of an initial Credit Services Notification Letter (CSNL) dated 12 December 2007 and subsequent CSNLs dated 13 February 2008, 1 June 2008 and 1 August 2008, respectively. Those facilities were to operate in accordance with UBS AG's Account Terms and Conditions (the respective CSNLs, together with the Account Terms and Conditions, being referred to as the Account Agreement). 

15Pursuant to the Account Terms and Conditions, Telesto's account and the facilities are ""governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the country in which the relevant Account is booked"" (that being, in the present case, Singapore) and Telesto, as the account holder, has submitted irrevocably and unconditionally to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that country (clause 19.1). 

16The funds made available to Telesto under the UBS AG facilities were used to purchase various investments on or to Telesto's account, those investments relevantly including bonds issued by a number of financial institutions in Kazakhstan. Chong J noted that the investments were purchased under the Account Agreement with UBS AG and were secured by way of a Charge Over Asset, that charge described at [14] of his Honour's judgment as also securing all other assets in the account. 

17The UBS AG Terms and Conditions, under which the Telesto account operated, permit statements or confirmations issued in relation to investment transactions carried out under the Account Agreement to be retained in a Retained Mail account if (as was the case with Telesto's account) this had been the subject of an instruction under the relevant Account Mandate. The information contained in such a Retained Mail account is accessible electronically by the account holder. The Terms and Conditions also contain provisions under which there is a deemed approval and acceptance by the account holder of investment transaction statements and confirmations in the absence of notification within a specified time of any errors or inaccuracies in the account. These provisions were relied upon by UBS AG in the Singapore proceedings for the submission that Telesto was deemed to have agreed to the investments in question. 

18In the present proceedings it was noted that it had been open to Telesto (during the period in which UBS AG later sold the collateral and extinguished the debt owing under the facilities, which was prior to delivery of Chong J's judgment in 2011) to have ascertained the status of the investments in the account by electronically accessing the retained mail account or 'e-banking portal'. The evidence indicates that Telesto did not do so (and that it had not accessed the e-banking portal since June 2010), although there is no suggestion that UBS AG was aware at the relevant time that Telesto had not electronically accessed its retained mail account during the period in which the collateral was sold by UBS AG in reduction of the debt owing to it. 

19In September 2008, the value of the collateral provided by Telesto in respect of the borrowings under its facilities with UBS AG decreased, leading to a margin shortfall in its account and, over the period from September 2008 to late 2009, there were discussions between Mr Tyne and UBS AG (at least some of which took place in Singapore) as to the basis on which UBS AG might be prepared not to exercise its right under the terms of the facilities to sell the collateral or to make further margin calls in relation to amounts owing under the facilities. 

20On 26 September 2008, Mr Tyne executed a guarantee and indemnity in favour of UBS AG, under which he guaranteed all the obligations and liabilities of Telesto owing to UBS AG under the respective facilities. The guarantee was expressly said to be governed by ""and construed in all respects in accordance with"" the laws of Singapore. Mr Tyne has, under the Guarantee, submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts and such other jurisdictions as UBS AG might deem fit (clauses 27.1 and 27.2). 

21On 29 October 2008, UBS AG issued a Notice of Margin Call to Telesto, noting that the collateral provided by Telesto was no longer sufficient to meet the required margin in respect of Telesto's obligations and that, as at 28 October 2008, the shortfall was USD28,159,607. The Notice required Telesto immediately to deposit additional collateral (or, if applicable, to terminate or deal with transactions booked in its account) so as to restore the required margin. 

22The October 2008 margin call was not met and on 22 December 2008 UBS AG notified Mr Tyne that a Default Event had occurred and that the full amount of the ""Total Liabilities"" (as defined in the Account Agreement) was immediately due and payable. However, that letter went on to advise that ""In recognition of your full cooperation to date"", and subject to certain stated provisos, UBS AG would ""suspend enforcement of its rights under the Account Agreement for the time being"". The letter contained an express reservation of UBS AG's rights and, further, stated that nothing therein was to prejudice any right of UBS AG. 

23A proposed ""Standstill Agreement"" dated 23 April 2009 was forwarded to Telesto in April 2009 but that document was not signed by Telesto and there is no suggestion that a binding agreement on the terms contained in that document ever came into existence. Nevertheless, it appears that during this period no steps were taken by UBS AG either to enforce its rights in relation to the collateral or to make any further margin call. 

24The arrangements by which a standstill or suspension of enforcement by UBS AG of its rights in relation to the facilities was ultimately put in place were not finalised until December 2009 (after the default in May 2009 of some of the Kazakhstan investments which comprised part of the collateral and after further (unsatisfied) demands had been made, again in May 2009, on both Telesto and Mr Tyne). 

25By letter dated 14 December 2009, countersigned by Telesto by way of acceptance of those terms on 31 December 2009, (the Standstill Agreement) UBS AG set out the terms on which it agreed (without prejudice to its rights under the Account Agreement) not to liquidate the collateral or to make further margin calls or call for further collateral until 31 March 2011 or the occurrence of an earlier event of default. In consideration for that agreement of UBS AG, Telesto agreed, inter alia , to procure a letter of undertaking from Argot (as trustee of the Argot Unit Trust) in favour of UBS AG. (Also as part of the arrangements contemplated by the Standstill Agreement, Telesto and Argot assigned to UBS AG the proceeds of certain litigation brought against a third party in Victoria.) 

26On 28 January 2010, Argot executed the Letter of Undertaking. The Letter of Undertaking expressly stated that it was to be "" exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore"" and that the "" exclusive place of jurisdiction for any disputes arising out of and in connection [therewith]"" was to be Singapore (my emphasis). Under the Letter of Undertaking, Argot undertook to open an account with UBS AG and to charge all and any assets held within that account as a continuing security in favour of UBS AG to secure Telesto's liabilities to it. Argot also agreed to apply the proceeds of the Victorian litigation (the subject of the assignment referred to in [21] above) directly to the Argot account towards repayment of Telesto's liabilities to UBS AG. (The Argot account was opened on or about 14 May 2010. Chong J noted in his judgment that the Argot account is governed by Singapore law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts.) 

27The Standstill Agreement (which contained no express choice of jurisdiction or choice of law clause) made provision for its termination on the occurrence of certain events of default, those including the failure of Telesto or Argot to comply with any of the conditions of the Letter of Undertaking; the failure of Telesto to comply with any of the conditions under the Standstill Agreement; and the occurrence (in the reasonable opinion of UBS AG) of a material adverse change in Telesto's financial condition or operating environment or of any event or circumstances causing UBS AG to believe that Telesto may not be able to comply with or perform any one or more of its obligations. 

28UBS AG has alleged (and Mr Stoljar submits, by reference to [32]-[34] of his Honour's judgment, that Chong J has found) that three events of default occurred under the Standstill Agreement in the period between 31 December 2009 and October 2010, including the making by Telesto's solicitors in Australia of claims against UBS AG in relation to what have been referred to as the ""Kazakh Bonds"", by reason of which UBS AG formed the opinion that Telesto might not, or might be unable to, perform or comply with any one or more of its obligations. It is contended that the effect of the occurrence of the Events of Default was that the Standstill Agreement was terminated and the amounts owed by Telesto under the facilities (and guaranteed by Mr Tyne) then became due. 

29It appears (having regard to the email communications referred to in the Telesto parties' submissions on the present application) that during that period there were communications between the parties on a without prejudice basis in relation to the account. The admissibility of those without prejudice communications must be doubtful but in any event there is other correspondence which indicates that by 8 October 2010 UBS AG was on notice of an intention or stated intention (on the part of at least Telesto) to commence proceedings in Australia in respect of matters in dispute between the parties in relation to the account. 

30The letter dated 8 October 2010 (relied upon by UBS AG as giving rise to an event of default under the Standstill Agreement) from Eakin McCaffery Cox (the solicitors acting for Telesto in Australia) was one in which UBS AG was advised that, the lawyers having been engaged ""potentially [to] commence legal proceedings against UBS AG in Australia"", they were instructed to commence proceedings against UBS AG on 16 October 2010 or as soon as practicable. The letter raised various allegations against UBS AG: the undertaking by UBS AG of a series of trades purportedly on behalf of Telesto without authority; the misrepresentation or omission by UBS AG of material facts in its promotion of debt securities issued by financial institutions in Kazakhstan; false and misleading conduct by UBS AG in relation to the provision of a financial service under Australian law; and the inducement by UBS AG of a financial institution in Kazakhstan to default upon debt securities issued by it in breach of its contract with third parties. (There was no express allegation of any breach of fiduciary duty by UBS AG as is now also made against it, though nothing turns on this.) The letter also adverted to the possibility of ""collective legal action"" by ""purchasers of Kazakh bank debt"" and sought details of any agent of UBS AG upon whom service could be effected in Australia on and from 16 October 2010. 

31On 11 October 2010, UBS AG issued a certificate of indebtedness (which, under the terms of the Account Agreement, was said to be conclusive) certifying the total liabilities due and owing from Telesto to UBS AG in respect of Telesto's account to be USD12,617,499.56 as at 14 October 2010. 

32On 15 October 2010 (ie, the day before the date on which Telesto's Australian lawyers had foreshadowed that service of court documents in Australia would or might occur), a number of steps were taken by UBS AG. It issued to Telesto a notice of termination of the Standstill Agreement, advising that Events of Default set out in the Standstill Agreement had occurred and that pursuant to the terms of that agreement it ""has terminated, ceased to be binding on the Bank and is of no further effect"". (Mr Stitt suggests that this was done in order to give rise to a liquidated sum able to be claimed by UBS AG and emphasises that, according to its terms, once terminated the Standstill Agreement was thereafter of no further effect.) In that notice of termination, UBS AG demanded payment of the Total Liabilities due as at 14 October 2010 in the amount that had on 11 October 2010 been certified as owing. UBS AG also issued to Mr Tyne, as guarantor, a demand for payment of the said total liabilities. Further, it commenced proceedings against both Telesto and Mr Tyne in the High Court of Singapore. (Argot was not joined as a party to those proceedings.) 

33In its Statement of Claim filed in the Singapore proceedings, UBS AG not only sought recovery of the Total Liabilities then owing under the facilities and indemnity costs, it also sought declaratory relief (namely, a declaration that Telesto and Mr Tyne ""are estopped from asserting, and/or have compromised, any claims or defences they may have arising out of, or in relation to, the Investments and/or the Total Liabilities, including, but not limited to, the acquisition or management of the Investments and/or the Total Liabilities"". The capitalised terms in the declaration so sought were as defined in the Statement of Claim: ""Investments"" being a reference to the investments, including bonds, purchased for the account by utilization of the facilities; ""Total Liabilities"" referring to the definition contained in clause 1 of the General Account Terms and Conditions.) By reference to the fact that declaratory relief was sought from the outset, Mr Stoljar submits, and I accept, that it is incorrect for the Telesto parties now to characterise the Singapore proceedings as primarily a monetary claim. 

34The declaration claimed in prayer 1 of the Statement of Claim does not in its terms source the estoppel/compromise in the terms of the Standstill Agreement itself. In the body of the pleading, the estoppel (and/or compromise) is pleaded as arising "" by reason of the Standstill Agreement, alternatively, the Implied Agreement"" ([25]) (my emphasis). The reference to an Implied Agreement is a reference to the implied agreement alleged in [24] of the Statement of Claim, namely an implied agreement by the defendants (Telesto and Mr Tyne) to waive and/or not to raise any claims or defences they may have arising out of, or in relation to, the Investments and/or the Total Liabilities, including, but not limited to, the acquisition or management of the Investments and/or the Total Liabilities. The implied agreement is pleaded as having arisen ""[b]y, and in consideration of"" the entry by UBS AG into the Standstill Agreement and the conferral on (and receipt by) the defendants of the benefits under the Standstill Agreement. Hence, the fact that the Standstill Agreement expressly provides that it is of no further effect once terminated would not of itself appear to preclude reliance by UBS AG on an estoppel or compromise arising from the fact of entry into the said agreement or the conferral and receipt of benefits thereunder. 

35By letter dated 18 October 2010, Eakin McCaffery Cox responded, on behalf of both Telesto and Mr Tyne, to the 15 October 2010 letters in which the demands on termination of the Standstill Agreement were made, advising that they would now commence proceedings against UBS AG and would effect service in Singapore. 

36Also on 18 October 2010 (but it is not clear whether this was before or after receipt of the above communication), a request was made on behalf of UBS AG of the solicitors then acting for Telesto and Mr Tyne in Singapore for instructions as to whether those Singapore solicitors were authorised to accept service on behalf of the Telesto defendants of the UBS AG writ in the Singapore proceedings. (The making of such a request thus put the Singapore solicitors on notice of the commencement of proceedings in Singapore at a time before any proceedings in Australia had been commenced.) 

37Instructions to accept service not apparently being forthcoming, an application was then made by UBS AG in Singapore for leave to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction and an order for service out of the jurisdiction of the originating process in the Singapore proceedings was made on 19 October 2010. 

38The writ in the Singapore proceedings was served on Telesto in Jersey on 5 November 2010 (and a Memorandum of Appearance was subsequently filed on Telesto's behalf in the Singapore proceedings on 24 November 2010). As far as service on Mr Tyne was concerned, a copy of the writ was sent by first-class registered post to the UK address nominated in the 2008 Guarantee executed by him. (The Guarantee makes express provision for service by such means and deems this to be good and effective service - clause 27.3.) However, the envelope containing the writ was returned unopened (bearing a postal sticker dated 23 October 2010 and recording delivery as having been ""refused""), at which point enquiries were again made of the Singapore solicitors as to acceptance of service on Mr Tyne's behalf of the writ (and again those instructions were not forthcoming). Orders were then made in Singapore to permit service of the writ on Mr Tyne by leaving a copy at a Queensland address or care of his Sydney solicitors. Service was duly effected on Mr Tyne in Sydney, by way of service on his solicitor, on 14 December 2010. (At [43] of his Honour's judgment, Chong J comments that the delay in service of the Singapore writ was probably due to the fact that Telesto's previous solicitors in Singapore did not agree to accept service on Telesto's behalf and hence it was necessary for UBS AG to apply for service of the writ out of the jurisdiction.) 

39Meanwhile ( after commencement of the Singapore proceedings but before service of the writ on either Telesto or Mr Tyne) the present proceedings were commenced by the Telesto parties (including Argot which, as noted earlier, had agreed that Singapore was the exclusive jurisdiction to which the Argot account was subject). A Summons and a Commercial List Statement were filed in this Court on 2 November 2010 (both having since been amended) and service of those documents was effected on UBS AG in Singapore on 3 November 2010 (two days prior to service of the writ in the Singapore proceedings on Telesto in Jersey). 

40In the New South Wales proceedings, the Telesto parties have sought declaratory relief (namely, a declaration that the investment transactions ""purportedly"" entered into between 14 January and 11 February 2008, referred to as the Kazakh Bonds, were entered into by UBS AG without Telesto's authority) as well as orders for the avoidance ( ab initio or from a later date) of the relevant transaction documents (including the facilities, the guarantee, the Standstill Agreement and the Letter of Undertaking signed by Argot) or, alternatively, orders to restrain UBS AG from taking any action to enforce any right or entitlement arising under any such instrument. By way of consequential relief, damages; statutory damages or compensation pursuant to various Acts; and equitable compensation are sought. 

41Having regard to the above chronology of events, it is apparent that, as at the time UBS AG commenced its proceedings in Singapore, it was on notice that at least one of the Telesto parties (Telesto) had expressed an intention, through its lawyers, to commence proceedings against UBS AG in Australia in relation to matters going to the validity or enforceability of the transactions the subject of the monetary claim by UBS AG in its writ in the Singapore proceedings (although UBS AG was not by then aware of the precise way in which the claim was to be pleaded against it, simply of the allegations that had been contained in the 8 October correspondence) - a fact relied upon by Mr Stitt in support of his contention (disputed by UBS AG) that UBS AG has had an agenda to frustrate the New South Wales proceedings. 

42However, it is also the case that, as at the time the Telesto parties commenced the present proceedings in this State, their solicitors in Singapore were on notice (and so, Mr Stoljar submits, through them also were the Telesto parties), through the requests made in relation to the service of process in that jurisdiction, that proceedings had already been commenced by UBS AG in Singapore against Telesto and Mr Tyne. (Again, however, neither Telesto nor Mr Tyne was at that stage on notice of the precise claims being made against them in the Singapore proceedings, not yet having received the writ in those proceedings.) 

43Pausing there, I do not consider that any adverse inference (of an intention to frustrate proceedings in this Court that had been foreshadowed but were not yet on foot) should be drawn from the commencement by UBS AG of the proceedings in Singapore simply because UBS AG was then on notice of an asserted intention of Telesto to commence proceedings in New South Wales (any more than an inference should be drawn that the Telesto parties, being on notice through their Singapore solicitors of a request to accept service of process, that might suggest that proceedings of some kind had been commenced against one or more of them in Singapore, were seeking to frustrate the Singapore proceedings). What seems to me to have occurred is that both parties were in the throes of commencing proceedings at or about the same time and were seeking to do so, as most if not all plaintiffs do, in the forum of their own choosing. 

44In the New South Wales proceedings, the Telesto parties contend that the Kazakhstan investments were not properly authorised; that UBS AG has breached a duty of care owed to each of the Telesto parties and/or has engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in breach of various statutory prohibitions thereon (in relation to advice given in respect of the investments and an alleged failure to disclose certain matters in relation to the investments); and that UBS AG has breached fiduciary duties owed to them (most of those matters having been the subject of allegations contained in the 8 October correspondence). 

45In respect of the lack of authority issue, it is alleged that UBS AG had been advised by Mr Tyne in mid 2008 that Pole Star (the investment manager of Telesto's investment portfolio) had limited authority and that express authority was required for investment in securities other than ""investment grade"" debt securities. 

46As to the claim in tort or for misleading and deceptive conduct, this relates to the alleged giving of oral recommendations and advice to Mr Tyne, in various telephone conversations in late 2007, in relation to the ""Kazakh Bonds"" and the alleged failure of UBS AG to disclose certain matters in relation thereto. The said recommendations or advice are attributed, inter alia , to what was said in one or more telephone conversations between Mr Tyne, who was apparently in Australia at the time, and an officer or employee then but no longer employed by UBS AG and then resident in Singapore (Mr Betsalel), about whom I will say more later. 

47As to the alleged breach of fiduciary duties said to have been owed to Telesto in relation to the account, it is alleged that UBS AG acted as advisers to one of the Kazakhstan financial institutions (the institution that had defaulted on payment of coupons owed to bond holders, including Telesto, in May 2009) and that the decision by that Kazakhstan institution to default on coupon payments was on advice given by, or with the concurrence of, UBS AG. 

48On 11 November 2010, steps were taken by UBS AG to resolve the question of the forum in which the parties' disputes should be determined. It commenced proceedings in Singapore joining each of the Telesto parties (including Argot who, as noted above, was not a party to the Singapore proceedings commenced the previous month), seeking an anti-suit injunction against them and on 9 December 2010, an application was made by UBS AG (by notice of motion in this Court) for a temporary stay of the New South Wales proceedings pending determination of its application for an anti-suit injunction in Singapore. Consent orders were made (without prejudice to the position of the parties in the anti-suit application) for such a stay. (From March 2011, successive adjournments of these proceedings have been ordered by this Court, with the result that no Commercial List Response has yet been required to be filed by UBS AG in the proceedings in this Court.) 

49On 21 December 2010, Telesto applied in Singapore for a stay of the Singapore proceedings on the basis of forum non conveniens (thus itself invoking the jurisdiction of that court to determine the issue as to where the disputes should be heard). Mr Tyne in turn filed a similar stay application in the Singapore proceedings on 10 January 2011. 

50The respective anti-suit and stay applications came before Assistant Registrar Tan in the High Court of the Republic of Singapore on 11 February 2011. At that time the total liabilities claimed from Telesto by UBS AG were in excess of USD12m. That was also the case on 21 February 2011, when the Assistant Registrar made orders in chambers dismissing the applications by Telesto and Mr Tyne for a stay of the Singapore proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens and granting an anti-suit injunction against Telesto, Mr Tyne and Argot from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute the Australian proceedings. 

51The orders made in February 2011, relevantly, were in terms that: 

1. The Defendants [ie the Telesto parties] are to forthwith withdraw and discontinue, and are hereby restrained from prosecuting, or continuing to prosecute [the New South Wales proceedings]. 

2. The Defendants be and are hereby restrained from commencing or continuing any further or other proceedings of any nature in Australia or anywhere else in the world against the Plaintiffs arising from, relating to, and in connection with [any of the matters specified in paras (a) - (n), which relevantly include the UBS AG account; the various transaction documents; the Standstill Agreement; any alleged breach of fiduciary duties by the plaintiffs on account of the engagement of UBS Limited in relation to the crisis in Kazakhstan banks; and ""any and all claims or defences the Defendants may have arising out of, or in relation to, the Investments and/or total liabilities ... including, but not limited to, the acquisition or management of the Investments and/or the Total Liabilities""] ... 
otherwise than in the High Court of the Republic of Singapore. 

52The orders made by the Assistant Registrar also noted the agreement of the parties that, notwithstanding orders [1] and [2], in the event that an appeal were to be filed against the Assistant Registrar's decision, no steps were to be taken in the New South Wales proceedings (which were to be suspended pending disposal of the said appeal). 

53On 28 February 2011, the Telesto parties lodged notices of appeal from the orders made by Assistant Registrar Tan. 

54During March 2011, UBS AG informed Telesto in writing of its intention to take steps to realise the collateral in Telesto's account and to apply the proceeds to reduce the liabilities owing in respect of the account (see letters dated 8 March 2011 and 24 March 2011 exhibited to the affidavit affirmed 7 November 2011 of UBS AG's solicitor, Ms Mills). 

55On 16 May 2011, the appeals from the decision of Assistant Registrar Tan were heard by Chong J in the High Court of Singapore. By this time, the Total Liabilities owing by Telesto had been reduced, by way of realisation of part of the collateral held by UBS AG, to a sum of around or in excess of USD5 million. His Honour reserved judgment. The appeals were subsequently dismissed on 14 July 2011 (by which time the Total Liabilities owing under the facilities, recovery of which had been sought in the Singapore proceedings, had been wholly discharged). 

56Mr Stitt places weight on the fact that Chong J was not notified by UBS AG, prior to delivery of his reasons for judgment, of the extinguishment of the debt claimed in the proceedings (submitting that UBS AG was obliged to act with equity and good conscience when seeking the anti-suit injunction and should have notified Chong J before judgment that the debt no longer existed; and that had this been made known to his Honour this might have had a determinative effect on the decision whether to grant relief at all and as to costs) as again suggestive of an agenda on the part of UBS AG to frustrate proceedings in this Court. UBS AG does not accept that it had an obligation so to inform his Honour and does not accept that there is any reason to have expected that this was a fact that would have been relevant to his Honour's decision (having regard to the basis on which his Honour determined the application). 

57I consider in due course what weight, if any, should be placed on the non-disclosure of this matter to Chong J. Suffice it at this stage to note that the submission that UBS AG did not act with good conscience with respect to the proceedings in Singapore and the obligations owed to the Court in this regard sits somewhat uncomfortably with the fact that the Telesto parties are themselves in apparent breach of orders made against them in Singapore. It does not seem to be disputed that the anti-suit injunction granted in February 2011 (and which as a consequence of Chong J's dismissal of the appeal has not been discharged) remains in place. Nor was it suggested that the injunction was not binding on each of the Telesto parties; rather, it is contended for the Telesto parties that the subsistence of the anti-suit injunction is not determinative of the application now before me. Mr Stoljar notes that in the context of the present application the Telesto parties have taken positive steps in the proceedings (contrary to the terms of the anti-suit injunction) in that they have served a Notice to Produce and have also taken steps to resist the present application for a stay. Needless to say, there has been no compliance with the order that the Telesto parties withdraw or discontinue the New South Wales proceedings. 

58On 25 July 2011, the Telesto parties filed an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Chong J but there was no appearance for them at the hearing of that application, which was dismissed on 16 September 2011. The present notice of motion was filed by UBS AG on 24 October 2011. 

59UBS AG has confirmed that it will continue to prosecute the Singapore proceedings in order to seek judgment on its claim for declaratory relief and indemnity costs. I was informed that the Singapore proceedings were listed for a pre-trial conference only a few days after the hearing of the present application before me but I am not aware what directions, if any, were made on that occasion for the preparation of the matter for trial. As at the time of the application before me, I understand that no defence had yet been filed by Telesto or Mr Tyne in the Singapore proceedings. (This is relevant when considering the likely ambit of the proceedings in Singapore now that the debt owing to UBS AG has been extinguished.) 

60After having reserved my decision on the present application, I was appraised by the solicitors acting for the respective parties of various matters: first, that Mr Betsalel (the ex-employee of UBS AG whose compellability or otherwise to give evidence in New South Wales was a matter that Chong J had considered relevant, though not determinative, when determining the stay application) had relocated from Singapore to Hong Kong, though the Telesto parties' solicitors subsequently advised that Mr Betsalel had since altered his instructions to state that he may not now be moving to Hong Kong; and, secondly, that Argot was deregistered on 8 January 2012 (though the Telesto parties' solicitors have advised that Mr Tyne is taking action to have the company restored to the register and have referred to their client's instructions to the effect that the deregistration occurred in error or by inadvertence). 

61As to Mr Betsalel's position, Eakin McCaffery Cox have advised (and this is consistent with the submissions made by Mr Stitt during the hearing) that Mr Betsalel has confirmed he is prepared to give evidence for the Telesto parties and to travel to Australia for cross-examination (a matter the subject of evidence and/or submissions before Chong J); the solicitors for UBS AG, Mallesons Stephen Jaques, have reiterated the submissions made by Mr Stoljar at the hearing of this application as to the views expressed by Chong J in that regard and have indicated that they are not aware of Mr Betsalel's present address (and hence that they have not been able to contact him). 

Judgment of Chong J 

62Before turning to the issues for determination, I summarise below the relevant findings made in the reasons for judgment handed down by Chong J in the High Court of Singapore on 14 July 2011 when dismissing the respective appeals by the Telesto parties. (While UBS AG contends that an issue estoppel arises in respect of many of the findings of fact made by his Honour, I note that in each instance that will depend on whether the factual finding was necessary in the reasoning that led to determination of the relevant issue. That said, on a number of the factual issues there does not seem to have been any serious dispute before his Honour or at least no reference to such in his Honour's reasons for judgment.) 

63His Honour observed that both appeals related to the issue as to which of the two jurisdictions (Singapore and Australia) was ""the more appropriate forum to hear and decide the dispute between the parties arising from a customer-banker relationship"" ([1]). His Honour also noted the concession made by Counsel appearing for the Telesto parties in Singapore (an important concession in Mr Stoljar's submission) that their claim in Australia could essentially be mounted as a defence to the claim by UBS AG in the Singapore proceedings ([2]), his Honour later describing the respective positions of the parties on the ultimate issue in dispute as being two sides of the same coin ([57]) (ie, whether UBS AG is entitled to repayment of the Total Liabilities under the contractual documents or whether the defendants were entitled to rescission or damages in respect of the investment in the Kazakh Bonds). 

64Insofar as it was submitted by Mr Stitt on the present application that the New South Wales proceedings are not, as Chong J considered they were (and, relevantly, as Counsel for the Telesto parties in Singapore seems to have conceded), ""essentially in the nature of defences to avoid liability to the claims bought by UBS AG in the Singapore proceedings"" or ""two sides of the same coin"" or ""in truth the defences against the claim by UBS AG"", Mr Stitt stating that the claim for damages under the Trade Practices Act greatly exceeds the amount that was claimed by UBS AG in the Singapore proceedings and persists despite the Telesto debt having been extinguished, Mr Stoljar submits that the concession made in the Singapore proceedings was correct and was properly made but that in any event the Telesto parties should not now be permitted to depart from it. This in my view reinforces the concern expressed by UBS AG as to the re-litigation of issues already determined in those proceedings. The concession made by the Telesto parties' own Counsel in Singapore, which was noted by his Honour and seems to have been relied upon as support for the conclusions that Chong J reached on his own analysis of the pleadings (see [2], [57] and [85]) is one from which the Telesto parties should not now be permitted to resile (at least not without any explanation for the apparent withdrawal from that concession). 

65At [37], his Honour noted that to that date neither Telesto nor Mr Tyne had made payment of the sum demanded of them. (This indicates that his Honour was of the belief that the full amount of the Total Liabilities remained outstanding at that stage. It is not disputed in the present proceedings that the debt in respect of the Total Liabilities was fully extinguished in late June 2011, his Honour's judgment being handed down about two weeks later.) 

66His Honour noted that at the hearing of the appeals he had directed Counsel for the Telesto defendants to proceed first with the appeal in relation to the stay applications on the basis that if it were to be decided that a stay of the Singapore proceedings should be granted (on the ground that Singapore was not the more appropriate forum to try the matter) then logically the appeal against the decision to grant the anti-suit injunction would be allowed but that the converse was not the case (since the fact that Singapore was the natural or more appropriate forum to hear the dispute did not per se mean that the anti-suit injunction must necessarily be ordered - that also depending on whether other requirements were established by UBS AG to justify the grant of an anti-suit injunction, such as whether the Australian proceedings were vexatious and/or oppressive) ([49]). 

67In considering the appeal from the decision on the stay application on the basis of forum non conveniens , Chong J applied (and noted that the parties were ad idem as to the applicability of these principles) the principles laid down in Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd [1987] AC 460. His Honour noted that the first stage of the Spiliada test required that the Telesto defendants establish that Australia was clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum to try the dispute (that not being the issue to be determined on a forum non conveniens application in this Court). 

68In considering the various connecting factors for the purpose of the application of this test, his Honour accepted UBS AG's submission that the Standstill Agreement was governed by Singapore law, noting that it was not a ""standalone contract"" but was executed to supplement and/or modify the rights and obligations of the parties under the Account Agreement ([64]). (His Honour also noted the concession by the Telesto defendants' Counsel during the hearing that Singapore was clearly the natural forum for the determination of the claims by UBS AG under the various contractual documents ([66]). 

69In considering the Telesto defendants' submission that Australia was the more appropriate forum to try the matter having regard to the allegations as to misrepresentations by UBS AG said to have been received and acted upon by Mr Tyne in Australia (which his Honour said was ""admittedly the only connection which the dispute has with Australia"" [71]), his Honour found that the place of the tort of misrepresentation was Singapore and not Australia ([80]). At [79], Chong J had observed that ""It is pertinent to point out that the tort in the present case did not occur without a contractual context: but for the banking relationship between UBS AG and Telesto which stemmed from the various banking instruments between the two parties, Mr Betsalel and/or Mr Farrell would not have spoken to Mr Tyne about the Kazakh Bonds to begin with"". 

70His Honour nevertheless went on to observe that even if the tort had occurred in Australia in his view that was not in his view in and of itself sufficient to displace Singapore as the natural forum to determine the entire dispute. (Thus it cannot be said that the finding by his Honour as to the lex loci delicti for the tort of misrepresentation was fundamental to his Honour's conclusion on the stay application so as to give rise to an issue estoppel.) 

71Mr Stoljar submits that the finding by Chong J that the place of reliance on Mr Betsalel's alleged misrepresentation was Singapore (and hence that the lex loci delicti for the tort for misrepresentation was Singapore and not Australia) ([80]) was correct, the alleged misrepresentations having been acted upon by communication of instructions to officers of the bank in Singapore. For the reasons I set out later, I do not accept that submission. 

72Chong J concluded that at [87] that ""The attempt to displace Singapore as the natural forum for UBS AG's claim [by asserting what his Honour described as ""essentially a tortious defence in the guise of a claim in Australia""] ... is disingenuous"" and that the stay application was nothing more than an instance of forum shopping by the Telesto defendants. 

73At [88], his Honour held that Singapore was not only the natural forum of the dispute but was clearly and distinctly the more appropriate forum for the determination of the dispute between the parties. On that basis his Honour dismissed the appeal against the decision not to grant a stay of the Singapore proceedings. Accordingly, his Honour's consideration of the second stage of the Spiliada test, namely as to whether the ends of justice required the stay of the proceedings, was in that sense obiter . Nevertheless, the conclusion reached by his Honour in relation to the second stage of the Spiliada test (in particular, as to the claim by the Telesto defendants that if the stay were not granted they would be deprived of the juridical advantage of pursuing the statutory claims for misleading and deceptive conduct available to them in this jurisdiction) formed part of the reasoning in relation to his decision on the anti-suit injunction and thus was not obiter in that context. 

74In the Singapore proceedings, the Telesto defendants relied upon an expert opinion from Senior Counsel in New South Wales (Mr J T Gleeson SC) as to the relevant Australian legislation and the juridical advantages available to the Telesto defendants thereunder (those being, broadly, the reversal of the evidentiary onus where the representation in question is as to a future matter; the absence of any requirement for the plaintiff to prove or plead intent, negligence or carelessness in the conduct alleged to be misleading or deceptive; the ""remedial smorgasbord"" provided by the legislation; issues as to causation, remoteness/foreseeability, and the lack of any constraint imposed by limitations on the right to rescind for misrepresentation at common law). 

75Chong J noted that Mr Gleeson did not conclude that the differences he had identified would make a material bearing on the outcome of the dispute given the specific facts of the case ([97]). His Honour, having reviewed the opinion of Mr Gleeson and having compared it with the position under the law of Singapore in relation to the same issues, concluded that there were no significant or material differences which would make it unfair or unjust for the case to be heard in Australia and hence that, had stage one of the Spiliada test had been satisfied (which it was not), UBS AG would not have satisfied the burden of proof under stage two of the Spiliada test ([96]). (The corollary of this, relevant for the purposes of the appeal in relation to the grant of the anti-suit injunction, was that his Honour considered that the Telesto defendants would not be deprived of any substantial juridical advantages if not able to pursue their claims in the New South Wales proceedings.) His Honour concluded that although there may be some differences between the relevant laws of the two countries they did not translate into any material difference on the specific facts of the present dispute ([101]). 

76As to the differences (and potential advantages for a claimant) between the Australian statutes proscribing misleading conduct and the laws of Singapore, Mr Stoljar submits that the finding by Chong J (at [92]-[95]) (that these did not translate into any material differences on the specific facts of the present dispute and did not displace the natural forum (Singapore)) was based upon a close analysis of the specific allegations of misrepresentation made in the New South Wales proceedings ([96]-[101]). He further submits that the conclusion that the alleged representations were not with respect to ""future matters"" (but, rather, were as to present facts pertaining to the status or suitability of the Kazakh Bonds [99]) is binding on the Telesto parties. Insofar as that was a finding on a question of law that was a fundamental or necessary part of the reasoning on the determination of the anti-suit injunction, I accept that an issue estoppel would arise on that issue (even if that might not have been the conclusion that would be drawn in this jurisdiction - and I make no comment as to whether that would be the case). 

77Having dismissed the appeal in relation to the stay application, his Honour turned then (from [106]) to consider the appeal in respect of the anti-suit injunction, noting that an anti-suit injunction is not invariably granted whenever a stay is refused; that such jurisdiction must be exercised with caution; and that such an injunction should only be granted and justified in the clearest of circumstances that the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive [109]. 

78Chong J then considered the five factors set out in [108] of his judgment, relevantly applying in this regard his findings that Singapore was the natural forum of the dispute and that there were no differences of sufficient materiality between Australian and Singapore law on the common issues in dispute (the latter in answer to the submission for the Telesto defendants that injustice would be caused to them if the anti-suit injunction were maintained because they would be deprived of substantial juridical advantages under Australian law). 

79His Honour found that the institution of the proceedings in this Court was not in breach of any contractual obligation other than Argot's Letter of Undertaking. In regard to Argot his Honour accepted that there was no issue of parallel proceedings so far as Argot was concerned, as it was not a party to the Singapore proceedings, and he accepted that, while its claim in isolation could be construed as a breach of the exclusive jurisdiction provision, that breach would assume significance only if the commencement of the proceedings by Telesto and Mr Tyne ""is somehow wrongful and/or vexatious"", since it hinged on the outcome of the declaratory relief sought by those parties in the Australian proceedings - thus his Honour considered that the fate of Argot's claim in the Australian proceedings would abide the outcome of the analysis vis a vis the other Telesto defendants' claims ([113]). 

80His Honour explicitly approached the matter on the basis that, in order to justify the continuation of the anti-suit injunction, it was necessary for UBS AG to prove vexatious and/or oppressive conduct independent of the non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses [127], noting that the vexatious or oppressive ground is a separate and independent basis for an anti-suit injunction ([128]). His Honour there applied the following passage at [12-073] in Dicey, Morris & Collins on Conflict of Laws vol 1: 

[12.073] In the result, an injunction may be granted if England is the natural forum for the resolution of the dispute and the proceedings in the foreign court are vexatious or oppressive. English courts have refrained from giving a comprehensive or limiting definition of these expressions; indeed, they have deliberately refrained from marking the outer extent of their power to act to restrain conduct which may give rise to injustice or, if the need for caution is given its due weight, serious injustice. It has been held that vexation or oppression may be indicated by the following: subjecting the other party to oppressive procedures in the foreign court, especially a party with no substantial connection with that jurisdiction; bad faith in the institution of the proceedings, or the institution of proceedings which are found to fail, extreme inconvenience caused by the foreign proceedings; multiplicity of actions, especially where the foreign action might spawn further consequential litigation which might not be reconcilable with the foreign decision; bringing proceedings which interfere with or undermine the control of the English court of its own process; bringing proceedings which could and should have formed part of an English action brought earlier; bringing proceedings for no good reason in a court which will disregard an express choice of English law . (my emphasis) 

81Chong J considered matters such as whether the institution and maintenance of the New South Wales proceedings amounted to subversion of the choice of law clauses in the respective transaction documents; the timing of the commencement of the proceedings in Australia (in the context of which his Honour said he would be slow to impute to Telesto any ulterior motive of 'getting ahead' before the Singapore proceedings, given that the Australian proceedings had been foreshadowed by Telesto in advance), his Honour according little weight to the order in which the claims were brought in the competing jurisdictions (as this would encourage a 'rush to fire the first shot'); and the possibility of there being conflicting judgments in the context of the non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the parties' agreements. 

82His Honour then proceeded on the basis that if UBS AG were able to show that the Telesto defendants would not suffer injustice if the foreign proceedings were restrained then an anti-suit injunction should be granted since the Singapore court was the natural forum of the dispute ([150]). Summing up his views in that regard, his Honour concluded that the commencement of the Australian proceedings was not in breach of contract (apart from the position of Argot); that there was no presumption that the multiplicity of proceedings was vexatious; that the possibility of conflicting decisions, while undesirable, was not in and of itself vexatious or oppressive; that the claims and issues in both proceedings were essentially similar though not identical; and that, although there might be some differences between the respective laws on the common issues, those differences were overstated and not of sufficient materiality to displace the natural forum, Singapore ([151]). 

83His Honour noted that there had been heavy reliance by the Telesto defendants on the perceived juridical advantages of suit in Australia as leading to the conclusion that the defendants would suffer injustice if the anti-suit injunction were not discharged. At [153], Chong J (having earlier noted that the court will not grant an injunction if by so doing it will deprive the respondent of advantages in the foreign forum of which it would be unjust to deprive him) said this of the rationale for the proposition that in order to justify the grant of an anti-suit injunction the applicant must show that the forum court is the natural forum and that justice does not require that the action should nevertheless be allowed to proceed in the foreign court: 

... if there is no advantage which the defendant would be deprived of if the foreign proceedings are restrained, then there is no reasonable explanation for not defending or pursuing the claim in the natural forum. Consequently, the court is entitled to conclude or infer that the defendants in instituting such foreign proceedings are indeed acting vexatiously or oppressively . (my emphasis) 

84His Honour's finding of vexatious and oppressive conduct was predicated on the finding that there were no differences of sufficient materiality between the respective countries' laws on the issues in dispute, and hence that it must follow that there would be no injustice to the defendants if the Australian proceedings were restrained and that the loss of the alleged juridical advantages did not render it ""unjust"" for the dispute to be heard and determined in the jurisdiction which he found to be the natural forum. His Honour said: 

In the premises, it must follow there would be no legitimate reason for the defendants to pursue the Australian Proceedings. In any event, even if the differences can amount to some juridical advantages (which I have determined to be overstated), the court can still grant the anti-suit injunction particularly in this case since the advantages are only available in the Australian Proceedings which is not the natural forum of the dispute.... There is no reason for a different outcome [from that in Bhojwani and Evergreen International to which his Honour had referred], on the specific facts of the case especially given my finding that Australia is not the natural forum of the dispute. (my emphasis) 

85The question of the compellability of Mr Betsalel, while a matter to which his Honour had regard and which he commenting was something that could not be overemphasised, was one that was not determinative of the issue, his Honour pointing out that he would have arrived at the same conclusion even if the compellability of the witness had not arisen as an issue. 

86The basis for his Honour's express finding (at [156]) that the Telesto defendants were acting vexatiously and/or oppressively in instituting and continuing with the proceedings in this Court (so as to warrant the maintenance of the anti-suit injunction), therefore, was that Singapore (a jurisdiction to which the Telesto defendants were amenable) was the natural forum for the dispute and that there was no material advantage to the prosecution of the proceedings in this Court of which it would be unjust to deprive the Telesto defendants (from which his Honour inferred that the institution and continuation of the proceedings in this court by the Telesto defendants was vexatious and oppressive). 

87Fundamental to his Honour's reasoning was the conclusion that there were no substantial or material differences in the relevant laws applicable in the respective jurisdictions which would make it unjust for the Telesto defendants to be deprived of the opportunity to pursue their claims in this jurisdiction. 

88Thus, insofar as Mr Stitt contends that the New South Wales proceedings entail claims under the Trade Practices Act that Telesto could not prosecute in Singapore and submits that the uncontested expert evidence when the matter was before Chong J was that a Singaporean court would be unlikely to apply the Trade Practices Act and that there was no equivalent to the Trade Practices Act in Singapore, this seems inconsistent with the basis on which Chong J reached the above conclusion. In particular, to the extent that Chong J concluded (by reference to his analysis of the pleadings and his knowledge of the law in Singapore), having expressly taken into account Mr Gleeson's opinion, that, if Telesto and Mr Tyne were able to adduce evidence in the Singapore proceedings to prove the facts pleaded in paragraphs [40] and [41] of the Amended Commercial List Statement in the present proceedings, then they should be able to establish a prima facie case of misrepresentation under Singapore law, which his Honour seems to have treated as having an equivalent operation in this case, then it seems to me that this gives rise to an issue estoppel and it would not be open to the Telesto parties now to re-open that issue. (Chong J noted that under Singapore law, on a claim of misrepresentation the legal and evidential burden would be on UBS AG to prove that it did not act dishonestly, recklessly, carelessly or negligently in making the alleged misrepresentations, in order for UBS AG to succeed in proving its case on the balance of probabilities) (see his Honour's judgment at [99]-[101], [155]). 

Issues for determination 

89With the above factual background in mind, I turn to the particular issues for determination. The test applicable in this Court on an application for a permanent stay of proceedings in favour of other proceedings, as recognised in CSR v Cigna [1997] HCA 33, (1996-7) 189 CLR 345, is that which was stated in Voth , applied in Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571 and Regie National des Usines Renault SA v Zhang [2002] HCA 10, and more recently affirmed in Puttick v Tenon Ltd [2008] HCA 54; (2008) 234 CLR 265; namely, that a stay is to be granted only if the Australian court is a clearly inappropriate forum (that being the test propounded by Deane J in Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay (1988) 165 CLR 197 at 242, 248, 251-255, and not the test stated in Spiliada as was applicable on the determination of the stay application in Singapore). The question for the Court focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of the forum (rather than the comparative exercise required by Spiliada ). 

(i) Comity 

90The first basis on which UBS AG relies in support of the stay application is by invocation of the principle of comity, having regard to the anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. It is submitted that the jurisdiction to grant that injunction was there enlivened by the tendency of the present proceedings to interfere with the due process of the Singapore court and that considerations of comity require that (at least in the absence of exceptional circumstances) this Court should be slow to permit or require a party to engage in any act or omission which contravenes such an injunction. 

91As noted above, Chong J, in considering the appeal against the grant of the anti-suit injunction, articulated the caution that must be exercised on such an application and the need for the clearest of circumstances to be shown by the applicant for such an injunction; his Honour clearly having in mind the principles of comity applicable in that context. Mr Stoljar submits that the corollary to the recognition that real consideration must be given to the principles of comity in the exercise of discretion to grant an anti-suit injunction is that those same principles of comity require this Court (in the absence of exceptional circumstances) to accord recognition to the anti-suit injunction so granted. 

92In CSR v Cigna , the High Court considered what is meant by comity in this regard, the majority referring to the explanation given by the Supreme Court of the United States in Hilton v Guyot (1895) 159 US 113 at 163-164: 

""Comity"", in the legal sense, is neither a matter of absolute obligation, on the one hand, nor of mere courtesy and good will, upon the other. But it is the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws. 

and going on to observe that it is for this reason that the cases emphasise that the power to grant injunctions in restraint of foreign proceedings should be exercised with caution (whether the injunction is sought in the exercise of the inherent or equitable jurisdiction of the court). 

93Mr Stitt maintains that a permanent stay of New South Wales proceedings because of a foreign anti-suit injunction would amount to the enforcement of a foreign injunction that would not otherwise be enforceable (noting that at common law a foreign judgment was never enforceable unless for a debt or definite sum of money: Sadler v Robins (1808) 170 ER 948 and citing the observation in Mortensen, Private International Law in Australia (2006), p137 to the effect that there is no reported instance of a court of equity enforcing a foreign order of specific performance or injunction or its equivalent). 

94Mr Stoljar accepts that an anti-suit injunction operates in personam . However, he draws a distinction between the recognition by this Court of the grant by a foreign court of an anti-suit injunction and its enforceability . Mr Stoljar submits that it cannot be the case that the enforceability in Australia of a foreign anti-suit injunction is a prerequisite to the courts of this country recognising and giving due weight to the judicial act constituted by the making of such an injunction. 

95The question as to what recognition is to be accorded to the grant of an anti-suit injunction by a foreign court (or, perhaps more precisely, how any such recognition is to be manifested in proceedings brought or continued in the local court in defiance of such an injunction) has not often arisen for consideration (perhaps, as Mr Stoljar suggested, because parties bound by such an injunction might ordinarily be expected to act in compliance therewith). However, the issue arose for consideration in Victoria in litigation arising out of disputes involving Lloyd's 'names', on the various decisions in which emphasis was placed by both UBS AG and the Telesto parties (from a different perspective of course). 

96In 1997, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia commenced proceedings against Mr White (a Lloyd's name) in the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking an indemnity in respect of several letters of credit issued by the bank to the Society of Lloyd's in connection with Mr White's membership of Lloyd's. Mr White then brought a third party claim against Lloyd's, seeking an indemnity in respect of the amounts claimed by the bank and damages for alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the Fair Trading Act 1985 (Vic) . 

97An application by Lloyd's for summary dismissal, or alternatively for a permanent stay of the third party claim, was dismissed by Byrne J (in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v White [1999] 2 VR 681, to which judgment I will refer as White [No 1] ). Byrne J held that Lloyd's had been validly served in the local jurisdiction and, relevantly as it later transpired, found that ""good reason"" or ""strong cause"" had been shown not to hold Mr White to the exclusive jurisdiction clause contained in his contract with Lloyd's. His Honour accepted that the exclusive jurisdiction clause (in a contract the proper law of which was English law) cast the onus on Mr White to show strong cause why the discretion should not be exercised to stay the proceedings but considered that Mr White had discharged that onus in circumstances where it was undesirable that an exclusive jurisdiction clause could potentially circumvent the statutory protection against misleading or deceptive conduct such as that provided in s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. His Honour observed at 705 that ""it is a hard thing to turn away a litigant who has properly invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, particularly where the consequence of this must be that the litigant is precluded from enforcing rights which he enjoys as a person engaging in commerce in Victoria by virtue of legislation in force in this jurisdiction"". 

98Byrne J said (at 704): 

Counter veiling considerations include the non-availability in the selected forum of the relief sought in this Court based on misleading and deceptive conduct and on breaches of the company's legislation. It is undesirable that parties should, by entering into an exclusive jurisdiction agreement, be able to circumvent a legislative scheme established by parliament to protect investors purchasing interests or prescribed interests. Put more positively, the statutes creating these standards of commercial behaviour for persons doing business in this jurisdiction do not exempt foreign corporations. Moreover, the policy behind them would not be served if exemption might be achieved by inserting stipulations as to foreign law or forums. Furthermore, in this proceeding, the very validity of the exclusive jurisdiction agreement is in issue on the basis of Lloyd's alleged improper conduct. If Mr White's challenge to it is successful, the agreement as a ground for a stay disappears. 

99After his Honour's refusal of the summary dismissal/stay application, and unsuccessful applications by Lloyd's for leave to appeal to the Victorian Court of Appeal and for special leave to appeal therefrom to the High Court, Lloyd's sought and was granted in England an anti-suit injunction against Mr White enjoining him from pursuing in the courts of any country other than England any claim against Lloyd's arising out of or in relation to his membership of Lloyd's and/or underwriting of insurance business at Lloyd's. The anti-suit injunction was granted in the context of the separate proceedings that were then on foot in the Commercial Court, Queens Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in England (the Jaffray proceedings) in which Mr White was one of a number of defendants sued by Lloyd's and on whose behalf a counterclaim had been issued raising similar allegations to those made in Mr White's third party claim in the Victorian proceedings. 

100After the anti-suit injunction had been granted in England, Warren J (as her Honour then was) in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v White [No 3] [2000] VSC 259 considered an application by Lloyd's for a temporary stay of Mr White's third party claim pending the outcome of judgment in the Jaffray proceedings. 

101Her Honour noted that the application for a stay was made pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court ([29]) and that the relevant principles had been considered by Lockhart J in Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd v The Boots Company (Aust) Pty Ltd (1992) 34 FCR 287 at 290-1. Her Honour applied the criteria considered in that case (which had been referred to with approval in both Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571 at 590 and CSR v Cigna at 390 n98). 

102At [44], Warren J considered a submission by Lloyd's to the effect that (while Lloyd's acknowledged that the Victorian court was not bound to give effect to the anti-suit injunction granted in England) the fact that a foreign court had granted an anti-suit injunction restraining Mr White from further prosecuting his claim in the local forum should weigh in the exercise of discretion in favour of the grant of a stay and that the court should grant such a stay for reasons based on notions of comity. Her Honour referred to the principles of comity considered in CSR v Cigna and the explanation of comity given in the passage extracted above from Hilton v Guyot and concluded (at [49]) that it was appropriate ""on the basis of duty, convenience and in recognition of citizens' rights under the law"" that recognition be given to the judicial act of the court in the Jaffray proceedings in granting the anti-suit injunction. Her Honour granted the temporary stay sought by Lloyd's. 

103Mr Stoljar submits that like considerations apply in the present case and favour the grant of a stay of the proceedings in this Court (notwithstanding that the stay sought here is of a permanent rather than temporary nature). 

104However, after judgment (in favour of Lloyd's) had been handed down in the Jaffray proceedings and a permanent anti-suit injunction was granted against the defendants (including Mr White) in those proceedings, Warren J considered and dismissed an application by Lloyd's for a permanent stay of the Victorian proceedings ( Commonwealth Bank of Australia v White [No 4] [2001] VSC 511). Mr Stoljar submits that the present case is distinguishable from White [No 4] : first, because no court in Australia has already determined that this is not a clearly inappropriate forum for the present dispute and, secondly, because the court in Singapore has dismissed the forum non conveniens application for a stay there brought by Telesto and has held that Singapore is the more appropriate forum. Mr Stoljar thus submits that the ultimate refusal of a permanent stay, notwithstanding the existence of a permanent anti-suit injunction by the foreign court, is explicable by the procedural history of the White litigation. 

105At [11] in White [No 4] , Warren J noted that the first basis for the permanent stay application then before her was the commitment of Mr White in his contractual arrangements with Lloyd's to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, in light of which it was submitted by Lloyd's that substantial grounds were required for a permanent stay of proceedings to be declined. The difficulty for Lloyd's with that submission was that Byrne J, on the initial permanent stay application, had found that good reason had been shown not to hold Mr White to the exclusive jurisdiction clause. 

106Her Honour noted that in White [No 3] , for the purposes of the interim stay application, she had considered it appropriate that the fact that a foreign court had granted an anti-suit injunction restraining White from further prosecuting his claim in this forum was a factor to be weighed in the exercise of the discretion in granting the interim stay and did not resile therefrom but went on to say: 

... However, in the same judgment (at para50) I observed that Lloyd's in the application for the interim stay urged that the fact that White agreed to an exclusive jurisdiction clause and the fact that the law of the foreign jurisdiction, namely England, constituted the proper law of the contract between White and Lloyd's together were factors to weigh in favour of granting the stay. I observed that there were separate issues that would be canvassed in the Jaffray proceeding as distinct from the claims made by White in the present proceeding and I cited the ""obvious examples"" of the breaches of the Trade Practices Act and the Fair Trading Act. Hence, in White (No 3) (at para50) in reliance upon Byrne J in White (No 1) I considered that there were separate issues, namely, the Trade Practices Act and Fair Trading Act claims, that could not be determined under English law. I observed, further, that if this was the only factor relied upon in support of the interim stay application I would decline to make the orders sought. Ultimately, I considered that there were other compelling factors such that it was unnecessary for me to determine whether to exercise my discretion on the basis urged by Lloyd's. 

107Her Honour observed that ""in the ordinary course most if not all of the submissions made on behalf of Lloyd's [as to why the approach of Byrne J to the import of the exclusive jurisdiction clause should not be followed in preference to the contrary approach of McDonald J in Williams v Society of Lloyd's (1994) 1 VR 274, where there was an exclusive jurisdiction clause and a permanent stay of proceedings had been granted] would bear much attraction"". However, where the question of a permanent stay had earlier been determined by Byrne J in a ruling that had stood undisturbed following the refusal of leave to appeal by the Victorian Court of Appeal and the refusal of special leave to appeal by the High Court, her Honour considered that in all the circumstances Mr White was entitled to the benefit of the policy of finality of judicial determinations ""and against a person being vexed twice in the courts for the same matter"" (citing the description of that policy by Hayne JA, as his Honour then was, in Christie v Baker (1996) 2 VR 582 at 603). 

108Thus, in the exercise of her discretion, Warren J considered that it was inappropriate and undesirable to grant the stay sought by Lloyd's and she refused the application for a permanent stay. It was after her Honour had come to that conclusion that she went on to consider, as a further factor weighing in the exercise of discretion, the issue of comity. At [39], her Honour commented that the essential basis of the decision to grant the anti-suit injunction by Cresswell J in England was the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the agreement between Mr White and Lloyd's (a clause to which Byrne J had found that Lloyd's had not shown good reason for Mr White to be held). Given the apparent contradiction between the two decisions, her Honour said that ""If compelled it seems appropriate that this Court should prefer its own decision to that of a foreign court in the circumstances"". (Hence, the significance attributed by Mr Stoljar to the fact that in the present case there has been no previous determination by this Court that is inconsistent with the basis on which the court in Singapore granted the anti-suit injunction.) 

109For completeness, I note that a further factor to which her Honour referred was the lack of commensurate provisions in the English jurisdiction to the statutory trade practices law provisions applicable in Victoria, which her Honour considered led to the reasonable assumption that the important Australian public policy considerations underpinning Byrne J's judgment had not been taken into account or given the extent of the weight and significance that would have attached thereto in this jurisdiction. Her Honour noted the authorities (on which Mr Stitt relies in the present proceedings) that dictate that in such circumstances comity does not require a court to stay its own proceeding on the ground that a foreign court has enjoined one of the plaintiffs from continuing such proceedings ( Laker Airways Limited v Pan American World Airways (1983) 559 F Supp 1124, 1134; Laker Airways Limited v Sabena (1984) 731 F 2d 909, 933-934, 937-938; Air Bus Industries GIE v Patel (1999) 1 AC 119, 136; Laker Airways Limited v Pan American (1983) 577 F Supp 348). The Victorian Court of Appeal later dismissed an application for leave to appeal from her Honour's decision ([2004] VSCA 101). 

110I accept that no issue arises in the present proceedings as to any contradiction between a decision of this court and that of the court in Singapore and hence the factor that was compelling against the grant of a permanent stay in White [No 4] does not apply in the present case. (That does not, of course, mean that the principles of comity necessarily require that a stay be granted in the present case.) 

111What I consider that the principles of comity require is that due recognition be given to the judicial act of the High Court of Singapore in granting (and upholding on appeal) an anti-suit injunction enjoining the Telesto parties from continuing to prosecute these proceedings and in dismissing the Telesto parties' application for a stay of the proceedings in Singapore. By ""due"" recognition, I mean that the orders made in Singapore may be recognised as a factor to be taken into account (though not a determinative factor) to the extent that this may be relevant in determining whether New South Wales is a clearly inappropriate forum and/or that the Telesto parties are or would be acting vexatiously or oppressively in continuing the prosecution of these proceedings or in the exercise of discretion whether to grant a stay (permanent or otherwise) of the present proceedings. 

112According recognition to the fact that an anti-suit injunction has been granted (at the same time as the Telesto parties' stay application was dismissed) is consistent with the approach adopted by Warren J in White [No 3] , from which her Honour did not resile in White [No 4] (the later judgment turning on the divergence between the respective local and foreign judgments as to the import of the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the context then under consideration), though I note the observation of Tadgell J in Rocklea Spinning Mills Pty Limited v Consolidated Trading Corporation [1995] VSC 15; [1995] 2 VR 181 at 183 that the dismissal of a stay application in the foreign court would have no bearing on the question whether the local court was a clearly inappropriate forum. (In Rocklea , his Honour went on at 184 to accept that the pendency of the foreign proceedings could be relevant in the sense that the availability of relief in a foreign forum would ""always be a relevant factor in deciding whether or not the local forum is a clearly inappropriate one"", there citing Voth .) 

113I do not accept that the fact that an anti-suit injunction has been granted would of itself warrant a stay of the present proceedings, since I consider that such a proposition would, as Mr Stitt submits, be tantamount to the enforcement in this jurisdiction of a foreign injunction. However, as I understand the submissions made by Mr Stoljar, it is not suggested that comity requires that there be a stay of the proceedings in this Court simply because an anti-suit injunction has been granted by the High Court of Singapore; rather, that this is a factor that weighs in favour of exercising the discretion to grant a stay (having regard to the consequence that, absent a stay, not only will the Telesto parties be in defiance of the anti-suit injunction but also UBS AG, an entity which carries on business in Singapore, will be placed in the position that it is in one sense participating in such a breach) and having regard to the real risk of conflicting judgments, as well as the waste of time and resources on account of the duplication of issues litigated simultaneously in different jurisdictions, if proceedings in this Court were to continue in contravention of the anti-suit injunction. 

114Understood in that context, there seems to me to be no inherent conflict in the positions adopted by the respective parties in this case as to the import of the anti-suit injunction, it being accepted by Mr Stitt that the existence of the anti-suit injunction is a factor that can be taken into account in exercising the discretion whether to grant a stay (the relevant test in that regard being that set out in Voth ); it simply not being of itself determinative of the issue. Such an approach seems to me to accord with the principles of comity as explained in Hilton v Guyot , namely that the recognition allowed to the judicial acts of another nation is one that also has due regard to the rights of those who are under the protection of the laws of the nation giving such recognition. 

115Thus, while I do not consider that comity alone requires the grant of a permanent stay of the present proceedings I am of the view that (both in the application of the test in Voth and in the exercise of discretion whether to grant a stay of these proceedings), the fact that continued prosecution of these proceedings by the Telesto parties would be in defiance of an anti-suit injunction (granted following a contested hearing and upheld on appeal following a further contested hearing at which both parties were represented by Counsel) and would have the necessary consequence that (at least if all the issues foreshadowed in the Telesto parties' defence of the Singapore proceedings are pursued) there will be an inevitable overlap between the issues to be determined in both the foreign and local proceedings is something that goes to the question whether (having regard to the controversy as a whole) it is vexatious or oppressive for the Telesto parties to maintain these proceedings (and hence goes to the question whether this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum). 

(ii) Issue Estoppel 

116The second ground relied upon for the stay is that the Telesto parties are bound by an issue estoppel arising from the decision of Chong J on the question of forum non conveniens . 

117The issue estoppel argument was put in two ways - first, that there has been a finding in contested proceedings between the same parties that the continued prosecution of these proceedings is vexatious and oppressive (it is said that, this issue having been determined, it follows that the Voth test is satisfied and that this is a clearly inappropriate forum for the determination of the dispute) and, second, that the issue of forum non conveniens has been determined (albeit by the application of a different test than would be applicable if such an issue were here to be determined) with the finding that the Singapore court was the natural and most appropriate forum for the dispute (from which finding it is said that the inevitable conclusion is that the local forum is clearly inappropriate for the purposes of the Voth test). 

118In Blair & Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Curran (Adam's will) (1939) 62 CLR 464, at 531-2, Dixon J said that: 

A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once for all of the issue, so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or their privies. The estoppel covers only those matters which the prior judgment ... necessarily established as the legal foundation or a justification of its conclusion ... (my emphasis) 

119Diplock LJ in Thoday v Thoday [1964] P 181, 197-198, [1964] 1 All ER 341, [1964] 2 WLR 371, contrasting issue estoppel with the other species of estoppel per rem judicatam (which his Lordship called 'cause of action estoppel'), said this of issue estoppel: 

... The second species, which I will call 'issue estoppel', is an extension of the same rule of public policy [that expressed in the Latin maxim 'Nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa']. There are many causes of action which can only be established by proving that two or more different conditions are fulfilled. Such causes of action involve as many separate issues between the parties as there are conditions to be fulfilled by the Plaintiff in order to establish his cause of action; and there may be cases where the fulfilment of an identical condition is a requirement common to two or more different causes of action. If in litigation upon one such cause of action any of such separate issues as to whether a particular condition has been fulfilled is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, either upon evidence or upon admission by a party to the litigation, neither party can, in subsequent litigation between one another upon any cause of action which depends upon the fulfilment of the identical condition, assert that the condition was fulfilled if the court has in the first litigation determined that it was not, or deny that it was fulfilled if the court in the first litigation determined that it was. 

120More recently, Handley AJA in Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd v J Aron Corporation [2007] NSWCA 195; (2007) 70 NSWLR 411 at [198] said: 

The Court which has to consider such questions [of res judicata or issue estoppel] must examine the reasons for judgment of the Court which made the decision relied on. This is particularly important where the earlier proceedings were dismissed. In such a case the res judicata estoppel is limited to the actual ground or grounds given by the Court in its reasons for making the order dismissing the proceedings. The dismissal will not create an estoppel on other grounds which could have, but did not, lead to that dismissal. ... 

noting that in Blair v Curran , Dixon J had gone on to say that: 

Where the conclusion is against the existence of a right or claim which in point of law depends upon a number of ingredients or ultimate facts the absence of any one of which would be enough to defeat the claim, the estoppel covers only the actual ground upon which the existence of the right was negatived. 

121In Champerslife Pty Ltd v Manojlovski & Anor [2010] NSWCA 33 the Court of Appeal noted that the test for an issue estoppel is objective, saying (at [106]) that ""For issue estoppel it is whether the precise question of fact or law sought to be litigated in the later proceedings was decided in the earlier as a fundamental basis for the decision"" (my emphasis). 

122Diplock LJ in Thoday cautioned that: 

... 'issue estoppel' must not be confused with 'fact estoppel', which, although a species of 'estoppel in pais', is not a species of estoppel per rem judicatam. The determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the existence or nonexistence of a fact, the existence of which is not of itself a condition the fulfilment of which is necessary to the cause of action which is being litigated before that court, but which is only relevant to proving the fulfilment of such a condition, does not estop at any rate per rem judicatam either party in subsequent litigation from asserting the existence or non-existence of the same fact contrary to the determination of the first court."" (my emphasis) 

123In Fidelitas Shipping Co Ltd v V/O Exportchleb [1966] 1 QB 630 at 641 Diplock LJ said: 

The final resolution of a dispute between parties as to their respective legal rights or duties may involve the determination of a number of different 'issues,' that is to say, a number of decisions as to the legal consequences of particular facts, each of which decisions constitutes a necessary step in determining what are the legal rights and duties of the parties resulting from the totality of the facts . To determine an 'issue' in this sense ... it is necessary for the person adjudicating upon the issue first to find out what are the facts, and there may be a dispute between the parties as to this. But while an issue may thus involve a dispute about facts, a mere dispute about facts divorced from their legal consequences is not an 'issue'. 

124Writing on "" Res Judicata: General Principles and Recent Developments "" Handley JA has noted that ""Issue estoppel, as its name implies, only applies to issues. There is no estoppel as to evidentiary facts or legal questions which are no more than steps in reasoning to the determination of an issue"" and that where several grounds for succeeding on a cause of action are upheld, there is no estoppel on the separate findings because none is fundamental. In Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, The Doctrine of Res Judicata , 3 rd edn, to distinguish the fundamental from the collateral the test is said to be ""whether the determination was so fundamental to the decision that the latter cannot stand without it"". 

125Mr Stoljar relies on Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner & Keeler Ltd (No 2) [1967] AC 853 at 918; 935 and Armacel Pty Ltd v Smurfit Stone Container Corp (2008) 248 ALR 573 at [56]-[82] as authority for the propositions, first, that issue estoppel can be based on a foreign judgment and, second, that it can be based on an interlocutory decision (where, as here, the decision finally determines the relevant issue between the parties). 

126In Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34; (2004) 220 CLR 363 at [21], as noted at [56] in Armacel , the High Court adopted the formulation in Carl Zeiss (at 935) of the following three requirements in order for an issue estoppel to be established: that the same question has been decided; that the decision was final; and that the decision was in proceedings between the same parties or their privies. As to the first, Jacobson J in Armacel noted that there was a need to identify ""with precision"" the issue which was necessarily decided in the earlier proceedings in order to see whether it was identical with an issue sought to be raised in the later proceedings, accepting that the question may be one of fact or law (and referring to Blair v Curran at 532 in this regard). As to the second, Jacobson J noted that it may be satisfied even if the earlier judgment is interlocutory (citing Castillon v P&O Ports Ltd [2007] QCA 364 at [49]ff), the requirement being that the decision be both ""final and conclusive"" and ""on the merits"" (citing The Sennar (No 2) [1985] 1 WLR 490 (HL) at 499). 

127(I note that in Armacel , Jacobson J sounded the need for caution in the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel ""especially where the estoppel is said to arise from a judgment of a foreign court, and in an interlocutory context"" (at [63]).) 

128Mr Stoljar submits (and I accept) that the decision of Chong J comprises a judicial determination (following a contest on the merits) in proceedings involving the identical parties to those now before this Court and that, as between the parties, his Honour's decision finally determines the relevant issue(s). The critical question, however, is as to what that particular issue is (or what those issues, if more than one, are). 

129Mr Stoljar (in the course of submissions) identified the relevant issue as being whether Singapore is the appropriate forum for the hearing of this dispute. While I accept that in a broad sense the same issue arises for determination in the present proceedings, the test for an issue estoppel requires the relevant issue(s) to be determined with precision. 

130The fact that a different test may be applied under the law of the foreign country would not preclude an issue estoppel arising (see Armacel , where his Honour noted that if the issue has already been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, issue estoppel operates regardless of whether the local court would regard the reasoning of the foreign judgment as open to criticism). Nevertheless, here, the difference in the applicable test for determining the forum non conveniens question means that in fact a different issue has been decided in Singapore than that which would fall to be decided on a forum non conveniens application in this Court (ie, the issue as to whether Singapore was the 'more appropriate' or 'natural' forum rather than the issue which arises here being one as to whether New South Wales is a 'clearly inappropriate' forum). 

131I have thus concluded that no estoppel has arisen in relation to the issue as to whether this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum for the resolution of the disputes between the parties. What has been decided in Singapore, relevantly, is simply that Singapore is the natural or most appropriate forum. A conclusion as to that issue does not determine the issue now before me. 

132However, in the context of the appeal from the decision to grant an anti-suit injunction, Chong J also made a finding that it was vexatious or oppressive for the Telesto parties to continue the proceedings in New South Wales. The issue as to whether the Telesto parties are acting vexatiously or oppressively in maintaining proceedings in this jurisdiction is one that is raised on the current application having regard to the test in Voth (and is to be determined objectively having regard to the effect of their conduct on UBS AG). I consider that an issue estoppel is capable of arising in relation to that issue. 

133Mr Stitt, however, submits that inherent in the proposition so put by UBS AG (namely, the proposition that the issue as to whether the New South Wales proceedings amount to an abuse of process is one that has already been decided by the High Court in Singapore) is the untenable proposition that a foreign court can decide (in some fashion binding on this Court) that proceedings commenced in this Court are an abuse of the process of this Court. In reply on this point, Mr Stoljar argues that recognition that the Telesto parties are estopped (by reason of the judgment of Chong J) from re-litigating the question of forum non conveniens does not involve any proposition that the Singapore court might decide that the present proceedings were an abuse of the process of this Court; rather that it does no more than restrain the Telesto parties from running an argument already run and lost in the Singapore proceedings, namely their argument that the Singapore court is not the appropriate forum for resolution of the present dispute. 

134It seems to me that a conclusion that the Telesto parties are estopped from denying that they are behaving vexatiously and oppressively in pursuing the present proceedings (as was found against them in Singapore) does not carry with it the untenable consequence for which Mr Stitt contends nor does it involve an acceptance that a foreign court can determine whether proceedings in this Court are an abuse of this Court's process. Rather, what it amounts to is an acceptance of the proposition that the Telesto parties may be estopped from now denying the effect of their behaviour, in continuing the present proceedings, on UBS AG, that issue having already been determined in a judgment binding on them in Singapore. Such a conclusion does not represent any abdication of the power of this Court to determine whether on the facts at hand the conduct of the Telesto parties amounts to an abuse of process of this Court nor is it inherent in the finding that there is an issue estoppel as to the finding that the conduct of these proceedings is vexatious or oppressive that this Court is bound by a foreign court's finding as to what amounts to an abuse of process of this Court. 

135The consequence of the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel in this regard is simply that the Telesto parties are estopped from denying, in the present proceedings, that the maintenance of these proceedings will operate in a manner that is vexatious or oppressive in its effect on UBS AG (as so found by Chong J), just as in other cases (by way of analogy) a party might be estopped by the finding of a foreign court that the effect of its conduct in other contexts operated to the prejudice of another party. 

136However, the question whether to grant a stay remains one within the discretion of this Court and hence I do not accept that the fact that the Telesto parties are bound by the finding made by Chong J on the issue as to whether the maintenance of these proceedings is vexatious or oppressive is determinative of the application before me. It remains necessary for UBS AG to persuade this Court that in all the circumstances the test set out in Voth is satisfied. That requires me to consider and form my own conclusion (as I do below) as to whether the maintenance of the proceedings is vexatious or oppressive in the relevant sense (albeit that the Telesto parties may be estopped from denying or raising a positive case against it). 

(iii) Abuse of process 

137The third basis on which UBS AG seeks a permanent stay of the present proceedings is that they amount to an abuse of process. UBS AG invokes the power of the court to stay proceedings which amount to an abuse of process so as to safeguard the administration of justice, to protect the integrity of the court's process or to prevent serious and unjustified prejudice or harassment ( Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 286; Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19 at 74-75; Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) (2006) 226 CLR 256 at [9]-[16]). 

138It is submitted by Mr Stoljar that even if an issue estoppel does not strictly arise, any re-canvassing by the Telesto parties of the determinations of Chong J would constitute an abuse of process since that would involve the re-litigation, in substance, of an issue already determined. Lord Halsbury LC in Reichel v Magrath (1989) 14 App Cas 665 at 668 said: 

... it would be a scandal to the administration of justice if, the same question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant were to be permitted by changing the form of the proceedings to set up the same case again .. there must be an inherent jurisdiction in every Court of justice to prevent such an abuse of its process 

139Reliance was also placed by Mr Stoljar on what was said in Tiufino v Warland (2000) 50 NSWLR 104 at [50] by Handley JA (with whom Powell JA and Mason P agreed): 

It has long been established that proceedings which seek to re-litigate some question which technically is not covered by an issue estoppel may be stayed or dismissed as an abuse of process: see Reichel v Magrath (1989) 14 App Cas 665. (See also Wall v Radford [1991] 2 All ER 741). 

140So, for example, in Rippon v Chilcotin Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 142, Handley JA referred to the finding in Reichel that a defence not barred by res judicata estoppel may nevertheless be struck out as an abuse of process and there concluded that although the defendants had not been party to the earlier proceedings, the later proceedings threatened the integrity of the administration of justice and raised the prospect of conflicting judgments; and were therefore an abuse of process. 

141In Habib v 2UE Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231, McColl JA (with whom Giles and Campbell JJA agreed), there speaking in the context of an argument based on a claimed Anshun estoppel, noted at [83] that ""new proceedings may threaten the integrity of the administration of justice if they raise the prospect of conflicting judgments"". 

142In Armacel , Jacobson J, having come to the view that there was an issue estoppel barring Armacel from contending that the clause in question was an exclusive jurisdiction clause (even though his Honour would have reached a different conclusion on the question of construction of that clause), referred to The Sennar (where the question sought to be re-litigated was as to the construction and effect of an exclusive jurisdiction clause) as authority for the proposition that it is not possible to avoid the consequence of an issue estoppel by simply re-characterising the issue as one which is sought to be litigated in accordance with the law of a different jurisdiction. (In The Sennar , Kerr LJ at 150 had indicated that to accept the converse of that proposition would be to permit uncontrolled forum shopping and, in effect, to subvert the policy behind the doctrine of issue estoppel.) 

143Mr Stoljar notes that, amongst the matters to which regard may be had in this context are, the importance of the issue to the earlier determination; the opportunity available (and taken) fully to litigate the issue; the terms and finality of the finding; the identity between the relevant issues in the two applications; the extent of the unfairness to the other party if the issue were re-litigated; and the impact of the re-litigation upon the principle of finality of judicial determination and public confidence in the administration of justice (referring to Habib at [91]-[92] and State Bank of NSW Ltd v Stenhouse Ltd (1997) Aust Torts Rep 81-423 at 64,089). 

144Considering those matters, it seems to me that the issue as to the vexation or oppression caused or likely to be caused to UBS AG by the conduct of the litigation in New South Wales (in light of the subsisting Singapore proceedings) was of fundamental importance to the determination by Chong J of the appeal in relation to the anti-suit injunction (though not to the earlier determination of the appeal in relation to the forum non conveniens application, since that was determined at the first stage of the Spiliada test); there is no suggestion that the Telesto parties did not have a full opportunity available to them to canvass matters before the courts in Singapore and to litigate the issue now before this Court; and, as Mr Stoljar emphasises, the anti-suit injunction was final and perpetual in nature. 

145It is submitted by Mr Stoljar that it is oppressive for the Telesto parties to use the present proceedings to circumvent orders made against them after a contested hearing in Singapore (especially where they have elected not to pursue an appeal from the judgment of Chong J) and that the public interest in the finality of litigation (and the avoidance of vexation by re-litigation of previously determined questions) requires that the present proceedings be permanently stayed as an abuse of process. 

146As to the extent of the unfairness to UBS AG if the New South Wales proceedings are not now stayed, UBS AG points to the substantial expense (in excess of SGD400,000) it has incurred in the litigation in Singapore in which it successfully applied for (and defended on appeal) the anti-suit injunction. It is submitted by Mr Stoljar that, having obtained that injunction following several contested hearings involving substantial evidence, that expenditure would be wasted (and in that sense UBS AG would be exposed to vexation and oppression), were it now required to litigate through to a contested final hearing substantially the same dispute in two countries. It is also submitted (as adverted to earlier) that vexation and oppression would occur if UBS AG were required to participate or acquiesce in a course of conduct involving defiance of an anti-suit injunction granted on its application in a country in which it carries on business. 

147In relation to the contention that it would be vexatious and oppressive for it (having incurred considerable expense in obtaining the results it has obtained in the Singapore proceedings) now still to be required to litigate the same issues at or around the same time in two different countries (in effect an argument that the expenditure incurred to date has been wasted and that there will be duplication of legal costs in litigating in two jurisdictions at the same time), this is predicated on the assumption (not unreasonable in light of the position adopted by Counsel appearing for the Telesto parties in Singapore) that the matters the subject of the claims made by the Telesto parties as plaintiffs in the New South Wales proceedings will be raised by way of defence in the Singapore proceedings. However, that assumption is one that may or may not prove to be well-founded having regard to the now reduced ambit of the substantive claims being prosecuted by UBS AG in the Singapore proceedings and it is in this context that the discharge of the Total Liabilities claimed in relation to Telesto's account seems to me to be significant. 

148The observation of Tadgell J in Rocklea (at 183) is not inapposite: 

The pendency of the New Jersey proceeding could not alone render the Victorian court a clearly inappropriate forum for determination of the dispute ... the mere pendency of a proceeding upon a dispute in another jurisdiction does not render litigation upon the dispute inappropriate here ... 

If the dispute were litigated in New Jersey there might be good reason to restrain its re-litigation in Victoria, assuming a re-litigation of the issues to be otherwise competent. The prospect of litigation of the dispute in New Jersey is alone, however, no reason to deny a prospect of its litigation here . (my emphasis) 

149His Honour went on to note that there had been no evidence before the trial judge to suggest that the litigation of the issues in the foreign forum would (or should) occur before litigation of the issues in Victoria and that it therefore did not follow that if litigation were to occur in Victoria (ie if the stay were not granted) then it would be a ""re-litigation"" of the issues. 

150As I have already noted, my understanding is that (unless this was the subject of orders made at the pre-trial conference that had been scheduled for November last year in Singapore and there has been compliance with those orders), no defence has yet been filed in the Singapore proceedings by the Telesto parties. Granted, they have, through their Counsel in the course of the Singapore proceedings, indicated an intention to raise in their defence matters mirrored in their claim in the New South Wales proceedings. Since then, however, the debt owing to UBS AG has been discharged and the monetary claim will therefore no longer fall to be determined in the Singapore proceedings. The remaining claims are for declaratory relief and for indemnity costs. By reference to the pleadings in the Singapore court it is not clear to me that the claim for indemnity costs is necessarily a contractual claim (so as to be likely to give rise to or be met by the same kind of defence as the defence that had been foreshadowed to the monetary claim), although I accept that the pleadings do contain references to provisions in the transaction documents that entitle UBS AG to a full indemnity in relation to certain charges and expenses. 

151It may, therefore, be that there is now a different forensic decision as to the defence to be conducted to the remaining claims in the Singapore proceedings and one that will not involve claims so closely mirroring the claims in the present proceedings. (I make no comment as to the likelihood of this or the consequences that might flow from such a decision having regard to authorities such as Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45; 147 CLR 589 at 602-3; Champerslife Pty Ltd v Manojlovski at [4]; Ling v The Commonwealth (1996) 68 FCR 180 at 184; and Zavodnyik v Alex Constructions Pty Ltd (2005) 67 NSWLR 457 at [39]-[40]. I simply note that I do not consider that I should assume what the content of the defence to the Singapore proceedings might ultimately be.) 

152Mr Stoljar submits that if UBS AG succeeds in obtaining the declaratory relief sought in the Singapore proceedings this will have the effect of bringing the entirety of the dispute between the parties to an end (since such a declaration would be fatal to all the claims sought to be prosecuted by Telesto and Mr Tyne in the New South Wales proceedings) and that any subsequent attempt by Telesto or Mr Tyne to re-litigate those issues would not be permissible, on the grounds of res judicata , issue estoppel or abuse of process. That may well be the case. However, that may also be open to debate in due course by the Telesto parties. Moreover, if UBS AG does not succeed in obtaining such a declaration then the question whether the present proceedings (if not stayed) would involve any re-litigation of issues determined in the Singapore proceedings would seemingly depend on which proceedings were heard first and, relevantly, on whether the defence raised in the Singapore proceedings challenged the validity or enforceability of the initial transactions or transaction documents themselves (as opposed to a defence going only to the estoppel/compromise said to have been effected by reason of the later Standstill Agreement and alleged Implied Agreement). 

153Therefore, I am not satisfied that there will necessarily be an abuse of process by reference to the re-litigation of the substantive issues in the Singapore proceedings if a stay is not granted though I accept the force of the argument that the costs incurred to date in the interlocutory applications in Singapore will effectively be wasted if the Telesto parties were to be permitted to continue the present proceedings (and that is a matter that may inform a decision to grant a temporary stay). In those circumstances, I turn to consider the fourth basis on which the stay is sought. 

(iv) Forum non conveniens 

154The final basis on which the stay is sought (pressed in the event that the question of forum is now able to be re-litigated) is that of forum non conveniens. 

155Mr Stoljar notes that the power to stay proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens is an aspect of the inherent or implied power which every court has to prevent its own processes being used to bring about injustice ( CSR v Cigna ) and that the rationale for the exercise of the power is the avoidance of injustice between the parties in the particular case ( Voth ). 

156It is accepted that the test to be applied is whether, having regard to the controversy as a whole, the proceedings are vexatious or oppressive in the sense in which that expression was used in Voth ( CSR v Cigna at 401; as applied in Armacel at 96). In Voth , in considering the ""clearly inappropriate forum"" test, the majority noted (at 558) that: 

...the question that [this] test presents ... focuses on the advantages and disadvantages arising from a continuation of the proceedings in the selected forum rather than the need to make a comparative judgment between the two forums. That is not to deny that considerations relating to the suitability of the alternative forum are relevant to the examination of the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the selected forum. The important point is that, in those cases in which the ascertainment of the natural forum is a complex and finely balanced question, the court may more readily conclude that it is not a clearly inappropriate forum. 

157In CSR v Cigna , the majority said at 400-401: 

...where different issues are involved in the local and foreign proceedings, albeit that the different proceedings arise out of the same sub-stratum of fact, the question is not whether the Australian court is a clearly inappropriate forum for the litigation of the issues involved in the Australian proceedings. Rather, the question must be whether, having regard to the controversy as a whole, the Australian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive in the Voth sense of those terms, namely, that they are ""productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment"" or ""seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging"" . (my emphasis) 

158In Oceanic, at 247, it was said that the words vexatious and oppressive are ""not used as directly descriptive of the conduct of the plaintiff but as descriptive of the objective effect which continuance of the action would have on the defendant "" (my emphasis). 

159Mr Stitt places weight on what Deane J in Oceanic referred to as the ""prima facie right"" of a litigant who has regularly invoked the jurisdiction of the selected forum to insist upon the exercise of that jurisdiction. At 243, Deane J said: 

the traditional process of determining such an application for the dismissal or stay of an action is not a mere balancing of convenience or inconvenience or the resolution of competing claims of different jurisdictions neither of which could be said to be clearly inappropriate (cf per Gibbs J, Cope Allman (Australia) Ltd v Celermajer (1968) 11 FLR488, at p 492). The starting point of the determination of such an application in accordance with traditional principle must be the prima facie right of a plaintiff to insist upon the exercise of competent jurisdiction which he has regularly invoked That prima facie right of a plaintiff is not to be lightly displaced or denied. 

and at ( 244) 

Not only is the jurisdiction one which should be exercised ""with great care"" or ""extreme caution"""" It has, as has been indicated, traditionally been seen as a jurisdiction which is only available to be exercised on inappropriate forum grounds where the court whose jurisdiction has been invoked by the plaintiff is so inappropriate for their determination that a continuance of the proceedings in it would be productive of the injustice of oppression and vexation of the defendant 

concluding (at 248): 

The power should only be exercised in a clear case and the onus lies upon the defendant to satisfy the local court in which the particular proceedings have been instituted that it is so inappropriate a forum for their determination that their continuation would be oppressive and vexatious to him. Ordinarily, a defendant will be unable to discharge that onus unless he can identify some appropriate foreign tribunal to whose jurisdiction the defendant is amenable and which would entertain the particular proceedings at the suit of the plaintiff. Otherwise, that onus will ordinarily be discharged by a defendant who applies promptly for a stay or dismissal if he persuades the local court that, having regard to the circumstances of the particular case and the availability of the foreign tribunal, it is a clearly inappropriate forum for the determination of the dispute between the parties. 

160Deane J noted that the general or traditional approach emerging from Maritime Insurance Co Ltd v Geelong Harbour Trust Commissioners (1908) 6 CLR 194, was that: 

...the power of a court whose jurisdiction has been regularly invoked to dismiss or stay proceedings on the ground that they should have been brought in some tribunal in another country is limited to the case where the court is persuaded that it is such an unsuitable or inappropriate forum for their determination that their continuance would work a serious injustice in that it would be oppressive and vexatious to the defendant. On that traditional approach, the clear inappropriateness f the local forum may justify dismissal or a stay. The mere fact that some foreign tribunal would represent a ""more appropriate"" forum would not. 

161Considering the question whether the Spiliada doctrine should be accepted, his Honour said at 252: 

In so far as legal principle is concerned, the balance seems to me to come down against the adoption of the United Kingdom doctrine. It is a basic tenet of our jurisprudence that, where jurisdiction exists, access to the courts is a right. It is not a privilege which can be withdrawn otherwise than in clearly defined circumstances...A broader forum non conveniens discretion to dismiss proceedings within jurisdiction if it appears that some foreign tribunal is or clearly is a more appropriate forum cannot, in my view, be readily accommodated in any of the established principled qualifications of that basic tenet. In particular, it cannot readily be fitted into the ""vexatious or oppressive"" qualification even on the less rigid approach to that qualification which should, in my view, be accepted. 

162Similarly, Lockhart J in Sterling Pharmaceuticals noted that a party who has properly invoked the jurisdiction of an Australian court is prima facie entitled to have his case heard and determined by that Court. 

163In the present case, I accept that the Telesto parties have regularly invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, having foreshadowed an intention to do so and (at least in the case of Telesto and Mr Tyne) not having done so in breach of their contractual arrangements with UBS AG. I do not consider that the fact that the Telesto parties were or might be taken to have been on notice through their Singapore solicitors of the request to accept service of the writ in the Singapore proceedings makes the commencement of the New South Wales proceedings necessarily an abuse of process (although I accept that it is has been said to be prima facie vexatious and oppressive for a party to commence a second or subsequent action if an action is already pending with respect to the matter in issue - Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571 at 590). At the time of the commencement of the respective proceedings, the position would seem to be that both parties were attempting to ensure that their claims would be heard in the forum of their choice. 

164Nevertheless, the majority in the High Court in Henry v Henry considered that to give undue emphasis to this prima facie right as a relevant factor could be misleading (at 588). (Brennan CJ went further and considered it erroneous in principle to have regard to this as a factor to be weighed in the balance in this context.) At 589, the majority said: 

There may be cases in which the notion of a prima facie right has some role in determining whether or not a stay should be granted. For example, it may well be significant in what is otherwise a finely balanced contest. But there are also cases in which that notion can do little more than indicate that the onus lies on the party seeking a stay to establish that the chosen forum is clearly inappropriate. Indeed there may be cases where the forum is so clearly inappropriate that the notion of prima facie right can have no real bearing on the matter, as, for example, if the cause of action arose in a country in which the parties reside or carry on business and their controversy can conveniently be litigated in that country. (my emphasis) 

165As to the observation highlighted in the passage extracted above, Mr Stoljar notes that UBS AG carries on business in Singapore; at the relevant time Mr Tyne's residential address was noted in the business records as being in the United Kingdom; Telesto is incorporated in Jersey; the account was opened in Singapore; the alleged reliance on advice received by Mr Tyne in Australia was the acquisition of investments held in the account in Singapore; and there is no suggestion that the controversy cannot be litigated in Singapore. 

166I note that there was a submission by Mr Stitt, but not one supported by evidence from the Telesto parties and hence not one as to which I can make any finding, that conduct of the litigation in Singapore would be more difficult for the Telesto parties, on the basis that the litigation funding in place was for proceedings in this country. In particular, Mr Stitt submitted that the conduct giving rise to the cause of action under the Trade Practices Act had substantially impoverished Telesto and Mr Tyne; that the suit in New South Wales could be prosecuted ""only because of the potential for litigation funding""; and that Telesto will be at an ""impossible disadvantage"" in the foreign proceedings. The fact that Telesto can only participate on an equal footing in New South Wales is said to be a factor militating against the stay of those proceedings reference being made in that context to Henry at [40]. Apart from evidence on affidavit from Mr Sutherland, the solicitor for the Telesto parties in Australia, as to the cost of the Singapore proceedings to date (around SGD159,000), there is not any material as to the financial resources of the Telesto parties or as to any litigation funding or the basis on which it might be available, from which I could form that view that there is such a financial disadvantage as to warrant that being a factor in the decision whether to stay the proceedings. 

167While I would not go so far as to say that in this case the notion of the prima facie right to the exercise of a jurisdiction that has been properly invoked can have no real bearing at all on the matter, it seems to me that it is but one of the factors to take into account when considering whether UBS AG has established that this is a clearly inappropriate forum for the dispute. 

168Similarly, in Henry v Henry, reference was made to the statement in Voth to the effect that while the substantive law of the forum is a very significant factor in the exercise of the court's discretion the court should not focus thereon to the exclusion of all other factors. (The relevance of the substantive law of the forum in this case arises because of the perceived juridical advantages available to the Telesto parties in prosecuting claims for misleading and deceptive conduct under the ASIC Act or the Trade Practices Act , a matter to which I will return shortly). 

169In Henry v Henry , the majority (Dawson, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) at 591 said: 

It is prima facie vexatious and oppressive, in the strict sense of those terms, to commence a second or subsequent action in the courts of this country if an action is already pending with respect to the matter in issue [their Honours there referring to Moore v Inglis (1976) 50 ALJR 589]. And although there are cases in which it has been held that it is not prima facie vexatious, in the strict sense of the word, to bring proceedings in different countries, the problems which arise if the identical issue or the same controversy is to be litigated in different countries which have jurisdiction with respect to the matter are such, in our view, that, prima facie, the continuation of one or the other should be seen as vexatious or oppressive within the Voth sense of those words. (my emphasis) 

170Their Honours went on to say that it did not necessarily follow that because one or other of the proceedings is prima facie vexatious or oppressive the local proceedings should be stayed but that: 

... it does follow that the fact that there are or, even, that there may be simultaneous proceedings in different countries with respect to the same controversy is highly relevant to the question whether the local proceedings are oppressive in the sense of ""seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging"", or, vexatious, in the sense of ""productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment"". And it also follows that courts should strive, to the extent that Voth permits, to avoid that situation . (my emphasis) 

171In United Pacific Finance Pty Ltd v Tarrant [2009] NSWSC 630, Austin J at [33] noted that ""the commencement of proceedings which create duplicity of proceedings is an abuse of process"" (citing Moore v Inglis , at 514 and 516 per Mason J; Commonwealth v Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 192, at [56]-[63] per McColl JA; and referring also to Slough Estates Ltd v Slough Borough Council [1968] Ch 299, at 314-5 per Ungoed-Thomas J. His Honour also cited Thames Launches Ltd v Trinity House Corporation of Deptford Strond [1961] Ch 197 where Buckley LJ said ( at 209) : 

[Counsel for the defendant] says that the principle is that a man should not pursue a remedy in respect of the same matter in more than one court. In my judgment, the principle is rather wider than that. It is that no man should be allowed to institute proceedings in any court if the circumstances are such that to do so would really be vexatious. In my judgment it is vexatious if somebody institutes proceedings to obtain relief in respect of a particular subject-matter where exactly the same issue is raised by his opponent in proceedings already instituted in another court to which he is not the plaintiff but the defendant . (my emphasis) 

172Here, at the time of commencement of the proceedings in New South Wales, the Telesto parties (albeit it might be said by reason of the refusal presumably on their instructions of their Singapore solicitors to accept service of the writ in that jurisdiction) were not on notice of precisely what issues were being raised in the Singapore proceedings (although they must surely have anticipated that they would at least include a claim for the Total Liabilities that had been the subject of the demand). Hence I accept that the institution of the proceedings themselves may not have been vexatious is the sense considered above. However, there would seem to me to be no logical basis for distinguishing in this regard between the commencement of proceedings and the continuation of proceedings in which there is a duplicity of issues (at least where the continuation is of proceedings which have not yet reached an advance stage, as is the case here, and after the relevant party becomes aware of the existence of the other proceedings, and hence the duplicity of issues). Consideration of that issue should also take into account that a determination (binding on the Telesto parties) has already been made by another court in relation to the question of forum - hence the significance of the first three grounds raised by UBS AG on the present application. 

173It is recognised that there may be circumstances in which the prima facie position that it is an abuse of process for any party to institute two proceedings for the one claim may be the subject of an explanation satisfactory to the Court (see Mala Pty Ltd v Johnston (1995) 13 ACLC 100 at 102; Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd v Wilson Market Research Pty Ltd (1996) 39 NSWLR 311 at 317; Guardian Group Australia Pty Ltd v Alice Lui [2005] NSWSC 1299 at [58]). Similarly, there may be a sufficient explanation as to why two proceedings raising the same issues should be continued at the same time. However, apart from Mr Stitt's submission that responsibility for the concurrency of the proceedings lay at the door of UBS AG, on the basis that it was responding to the foreshadowed intention of the Telesto parties to commence proceedings in Australia, which it was submitted was sufficient to address the concern as to a concurrency of proceedings (reference being made in that regard to News Corporation v Lenfest Communications Inc [1996] NSWSC 474), the present application seems to have been approached by the Telesto parties on the basis that the claim made by UBS AG for declaratory relief could equally be put as a defence to the present proceedings and there was no reason why the matter should not be heard in this jurisdiction alone. (Such a submission seem tacitly to accept that it would not be in the public interest in the administration of justice for there to be permitted the risk of inconsistent decisions on the same issues, as will be the case if both the Singapore proceedings and the present proceedings are to be continued, at least if the Telesto parties in the defence of the former proceedings raise the same issues as are raised in their claims in the present proceedings.) 

174In that regard, UBS AG had made demands for the moneys payable from as early as 2008 and had reserved its rights. It might have been expected that if it had proceeded to enforce that demand it would do so in the jurisdiction contemplated in the Account Terms and Conditions. Any suggestion that UBS AG in so doing was being responsive to the threat of litigation by the Telesto parties might equally be met by the inference that the Telesto parties, aware of the likelihood that any claim against them would be made in Singapore, were seeking to pre-empt that choice of forum (in effect that being the finding of Chong J on the issue of forum-shopping). In any event, that does not address my concern at the oppressiveness of both proceedings remaining on foot, with the risk of conflicting judgments, if the same or similar issues will arise for determination in each. 

175Mr Stitt also submits that there is suspicion as to the conduct of UBS AG arising from the fact that the principal relief now remaining to be sought in the Singapore proceedings is for a negative declaration, referring to what was said in The Daeyang Honey [1993] FCA 584 by Gummow J, where his Honour in the Federal Court refused to stay proceedings in that court notwithstanding that it was contended that a successful prosecution of the claim for declaratory relief would finally dispose of the matter (and notwithstanding that the foreign proceedings were commenced first in time). 

176Similarly, Mr Stitt points to the fact that in CSR v Cigna , where the relief sought was a negative declaration, the court found that the dominant purpose in the institution of the New South Wales proceedings was to prevent the appellants from pursuing remedies available in the US proceedings but not in the New South Wales proceedings. In Tarrant, Austin J referred to the observation in Kolden Holdings Ltd v Rodette Commerce Ltd [2008] 3 All ER 612 at [7] by Lawrence Collins LJ about such claims: 

About 20 years ago Kerr LJ said that claims for negative declarations, in particular, ""must be viewed with great caution in all situations involving possible conflicts of jurisdictions, since they obviously lend themselves to improper attempts at forum shopping"": see Saipem SpA v Dredging VO2 BV and Geosite Surveys Ltd, Volvox Hollandia [1988] 2 Lloyd's Rep 361 at 371. Although that is not always the case (see Messier-Dowty Ltd v Sabena SA (No 2) [2000] 1 All ER (Comm) 833 at 842; [2000] 1 WLR 2040 at 2049 (para 36)), it is hard to resist the conclusion that the present case is one of the use of a claim for negative declarations to wrest jurisdiction from the natural forum. 

177However, in Armacel , speaking as to the situation where what is sought in the foreign jurisdiction is negative declaratory relief, Jacobson J said (at [97]): 

..for the reasons referred to by Lord Woolf in Messier Dowty at [34]-[42], I do not consider that I should approach the question with an adverse pre-disposition to the claim for negative declaratory relief: Challenger Group Holdings Ltd v Concept Equity Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 374 at [42]-[43]. This issue in the US District Court is not hypothetical. Our courts should be slow to criticise the approach of the foreign court to the question of negative declaratory relief. It must be a matter of discretion in all the circumstances. (my emphasis) 

178I do not accept that I should draw an adverse inference as to the purpose of UBS AG in seeking a negative declaration in the Singapore proceedings, even though those proceedings were commenced at a time when UBS AG was aware that Telesto was threatening to commence litigation in Australia. The very factors that led Chong J to conclude that Singapore was the natural and most appropriate forum for the dispute in my view also count against a conclusion that the purpose of commencing the proceedings in that forum was to deprive Telesto of remedies that might be available to it in New South Wales (particularly given that the proceedings as instituted also claimed other relief and were not restricted to a claim for a negative declaration). Further, the negative declaration is clearly not hypothetical, since its determination will or may affect the relief sought by the Telesto parties in these (even if no longer in the Singapore proceedings). 

179That said, the fact that no claim for monetary relief (other than costs) will be pressed at the final hearing does seem to me to be of some significance in the way I have explained above (since if the issues to be determined at the hearing in Singapore, absent any matters that the Telesto parties may raise by way of cross-claim, are confined to the events leading up to entry into the Standstill Agreement and Argot's Letter of Undertaking, then the dispute as to the authorisation to enter into the transactions and issues as to the alleged misleading and deceptive conduct and breach of fiduciary duty will seemingly not arise at all in the Singapore proceedings). 

180If it be the case that, because no claim for recovery of the Total Liabilities under the facilities will now be pressed, there is a real prospect that the Telesto parties may no longer seek to raise as defences in the Singapore proceedings the claims sought to be raised in their capacity as plaintiffs in the present proceedings, then the concerns as to duplication of issues and the risk of conflicting decisions will not necessarily arise (or at least will not have the same force as had there been a direct overlap in the issues to be determined in each jurisdiction). 

181The claim by UBS AG for declaratory relief turns, as I understand it, on the circumstances in which the Standstill Agreement was negotiated and entered into between the parties. It does not turn on the matters which are alleged to constitute misleading and deceptive or negligent conduct in the entry into the facilities in the first place or in the subsequent conduct of UBS AG (or, for that matter, breach of fiduciary duty) in relation to those facilities. Therefore, while I accept that declaratory relief sought in Singapore may be dispositive of the entirety of the claims by the Telesto parties, that seems to me to involve a temporal issue as to whether the determination of that issue in advance would be the most expeditious way to conduct the proceedings (in whichever jurisdiction) rather than this being a case where the same issues will necessarily be litigated in two proceedings (as would potentially the case if the estoppel/compromise issue were to be determined in favour of the Telesto parties and it was open to them to pursue in both these and the Singapore proceedings the issues going to the initial transactions). 

182Although reliance was placed on the concessions made in the proceedings before Chong J by Counsel for the Telesto parties that Singapore was clearly the natural forum for the determination of UBS AG's claims under the various contractual documents against them (noted in the judgment at [66]) and that the Telesto parties' claim in Australia could essentially be mounted as a defence to UBS AG's claim in Singapore (noted in the judgment at [2]), as well as the acknowledgement that if the Singapore proceedings were not stayed then the Telesto parties would simply raise the issues in the Australian proceedings as a defence and counterclaim in the Singapore proceedings (referred to in the judgment at [85]), the difficulty I have in this regard is that it is by no means clear what issues will now be raised by the Telesto parties in Singapore by way of defence/cross-claim having regard to what has since emerged as to the present debt position of the Telesto parties. Ms Mills' affidavit of 7 November 2011 deposes to the advice received from UBS AG's Singapore solicitors that (as at that date) the pleadings had not and (and were not deemed to have been) closed in Singapore. Hence there must be a prospect that the previously stated position as to what would be the subject matter of the defences may be revised. 

183Mr Stoljar submits that even if different issues are involved in the two sets of proceedings, it would follow that, having regard to the controversy as a whole, the New South Wales proceedings are vexatious or oppressive in the Voth sense of those terms, namely, that they are ""productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment"" or ""seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging"" because of the existence of the anti-suit injunction granted, and upheld on appeal, by the High Court of Singapore. That is identified as a significant factor in favour of a conclusion that this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum or that the continuation of the litigation in this forum is oppressive. 

184The relevant factors to be taken into account when considering whether this is a clearly inappropriate forum are summarised by the learned authors of Nygh's Conflict of Laws in Australia (8 th ed) as being: 

(a) Any significant connection between the forum selected and the subject matter of the action and/or the parties, such as the domiciles of the parties, their places of business and the place where the relevant transaction occurred or the subject matter of the suit is situated, and other factors affecting convenience or expense, such as the availability of witnesses. 

(b) Any legitimate and substantial juridical advantage to the plaintiff, such as greater recovery, more favourable limitation period, better ancillary procedures, or assets within the jurisdiction against which any judgment can be enforced. 

(c) Whether the law of the forum will supply the substantive law to be applied in the resolution of the subject case or whether the matter is governed by foreign law. 

185As to the first group of factors (the connection between the forum selected and the proceedings), UBS AG relies on a succession of matters (the subject of factual findings or otherwise referred to in Chong J's judgment) as cumulatively indicating that this Court is a clearly inappropriate or oppressive forum for litigation of the present dispute. Broadly speaking, they include matters relating to the location of the respective parties (UBS AG carrying on business in Singapore through its Singapore branch; Telesto being an underlying company of a purpose trust registered in Jersey); the place of issue (and in some cases execution) of the contractual documents and/or performance of the relevant facilities and the Telesto and Argot accounts (that being Singapore, where the respective accounts were booked and serviced); the respective jurisdiction/choice of law clauses in the agreements; that the Telesto parties are amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court (and submitted to the jurisdiction of that court in bringing their stay application); the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Argot Letter of Undertaking; and that some of the negotiations for (and the place of performance of certain of the obligations under) the Standstill Agreement took place in Singapore. 

186For his part, Mr Stitt notes that none of the Telesto parties resides in Singapore, conducts business there or now has assets in the jurisdiction (apart from the residue of the Telesto account); that Mr Tyne resides in Australia (though the address given on the business documents was an address in the United Kingdom and the attempt at service of Mr Tyne in Queensland seems to have been met with the response that Mr Tyne lives overseas most of the time); and that Argot and Pole Star are Australian companies. 

187It is further submitted that Mr Tyne was (and remains) a client of UBS in Australia (but had been encouraged by his then Australian client adviser, Mr Betsalel, to place the Telesto account with UBS Singapore after Mr Betsalel had relocated from Sydney to Singapore) and that at all times the Telesto account was managed by UBS from its ""Australia desk"" in Singapore. (There is, however, no evidence before me as to the circumstances in which the Telesto account was opened in Singapore nor as to the significance or operation of the ""Australia desk"", whether in relation to Telesto's account or otherwise. Mr Stoljar points to the fact that Chong J found (at [10]) that the account was serviced from the Singapore branch of UBS. He submits, and I accept, that Mr Tyne's subjective motivation for opening the account in Singapore is irrelevant.) 

188Mr Stitt also points to the making of the alleged misrepresentations to Mr Tyne, then resident in New South Wales resident, over the telephone and to the authorities to the effect that a representation or statement effected by telephone takes place ""where the message is received - wherever it is heard on the telephone"" (per Denning LJ In Diamond v Bank of London and Montreal (1979) QB 333; and see Ramsey v Vogler [2000] NSWCA 260 at [36] to [48]). Lord Denning MR said in Diamond (at [346]): 

In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation it seems to me that the tort is committed at the place where the representation is received and acted upon; and not the place from where it was sent. Logically, it seems to me, the same applies to a negligent misrepresentation by telephone or by telex. It is committed where it is received and acted upon. 

189Stephenson LJ agreed with Lord Denning MR and said further that: 

But it is settled law that A's misrepresentation, however fraudulent and morally wrong, does not become tortious until B not merely receives it but acts upon it [ citations omitted ]. The damage may be suffered when and where B acts or begins to act upon the representation, but it may be suffered at a later time or at a different place. Although A's part of the tort is committed when and where he speaks or telexes or writes the misrepresentation, B's part is needed to complete the tort by acting upon the representation, and the tort is committed, in my judgment, when and where he does so act. 

190In this regard, Mr Stoljar's response to this is that whether or not the alleged representations by telephone were received by Mr Tyne in New South Wales, the critical question is where the acts of reliance occurred (referring to the finding of Chong J that the place of reliance was Singapore where Mr Tyne's instructions were communicated and where the transactions effected on his instructions). In Voth , however, in the course of a discussion of English authorities, their Honours said at [568]): 

In The ""Albaforth"" it was said by Ackner LJ and by Robert LJ that it had been held in Diamond that the substance of the tort of negligent misstatement is committed where the statement is received and acted upon. That is accurate so far as it reflects the facts considered in that case. But there is not and cannot be any such general rule, for a statement may be received in one place and acted upon in another. And The ""Albaforth"" provides no basis for a conclusion that it is the place where the statement is acted upon which determines the place at which the statement was made. That place may have no connexion at all with the place where the statement was initiated or the place where it was completed. And the place where it is acted upon may be entirely fortuitous. 

191Reliance was also placed by Mr Stoljar on the location of the witnesses to establish UBS AG's contractual claim (and presumably its defence to the claims raised in the New South Wales proceedings) and to the observations made by Chong J in relation to the (non) compellability of Mr Betsalel. In this regard, Mr Stitt contends that the location of witnesses in relation to the contractual claim is immaterial as the claim remaining is for declaratory relief (though there is the indemnity costs claim that may be sourced in contractual obligations and it does not seem to me that the calling of local witnesses in that regard can be excluded) and that the compellability of Mr Betsalel is irrelevant as he has agreed to attend any proceedings conducted in New South Wales. In response, Mr Stoljar submits that it is immaterial whether or not Mr Betsalel has expressed any 'agreement' or 'willingness' to testify in Australia, since there is a practical necessity for compellability where a witness is not under a party's control. Clearly, the evidence of Mr Betsalel will be necessary insofar as the Telesto parties make claims of oral representations by him. 

192As to the second set of factors referred to in Nygh , the reliance placed on the perceived juridical advantages of the present jurisdiction has already been noted (as have Chong J's findings in that regard). The perceived juridical advantages are the existence of forms of relief available under the Trade Practices Act that may not be available in Singapore and the evidentiary and onus of proof advantages for a claim under the Trade Practices Act as compared to proceedings for negligent misrepresentation (as identified by Mr Gleeson in the opinion tendered in evidence in the Singapore proceedings). Mr Stitt relies on the observation by Gummow J in DA Technology Australia Pty Limited v Discreet Logic Inc [1994] FCA 958 at [36] that there is an Australian public interest in the application of a statute of this nature by a Court selected by the Parliament and to the observations of Byrne J in White [No 1] in this regard. 

193Mr Stoljar, however, emphasises that the conclusion of Chong J, based upon his Honour's analysis of the pleadings and of the expert evidence of Mr Gleeson was that, on the specific facts of this case, there would be no material differences or advantages for the Telesto parties arising under the Trade Practices Act (referring to his Honour's judgment at [96], [101], [104], [110], and [151](d)). 

194The essential question posed by Jacobson J in Armacel was whether Armacel would be able to obtain in the proceedings in the foreign court the relief it sought in this jurisdiction under the Trade Practices Act . His Honour accepted the evidence put before him (albeit not as an independent expert) by Smurfit's legal counsel in the US proceeding that such relief would fall within the supplemental jurisdiction of the US court (and that it was very unlikely that the court there would refuse to exercise such supplemental jurisdiction even though he conceded that the Pennsylvania court was not familiar with the application of the Trade Practices Act ). Thus his Honour was not satisfied that Armacel was deprived of a legitimate forensic disadvantage in being forced to bring its claim in the United States ([111]). In the present circumstances, I consider that one cannot discount the analysis performed by Chong J and which led his Honour (having had the benefit of Mr Gleeson's opinion and his own knowledge of Singaporean law in this area) to conclude that there would be no substantial or material advantage to the Telesto parties in prosecuting their claims in this jurisdiction. 

195Further Mr Stoljar submits that, even if a stay of the proceedings in this Court would result in the loss of material juridical advantages to the Telesto parties, this alone will not necessarily justify refusal of a stay, adopting the words of Lord Goff in Spiliada (referred to in Voth at 564-565 and by Campbell JA in Garsec v Sultan of Brunei [2008] NSWCA 211; (2008) 250 ALR 682 at [48]) in submitting that, as a general rule, the court should not be deterred from granting a stay of proceedings ""simply because the plaintiff will be deprived of such an advantage, provided that the court is satisfied that substantial justice will be done in the available appropriate forum"". Mr Stoljar submits, and I accept, that the Court should be satisfied that substantial justice will be done in Singapore. 

196As to the third factor identified by Nygh, Mr Stoljar submits that UBS AG's causes of action against Telesto and Mr Tyne accrued in Singapore, by virtue of the Account and the Guarantee which gave rise to the customer-banker relationship between the parties being operated and serviced in Singapore (as found by Chong J at [58]). Mr Stitt submits that none of the Facilities, Guarantee, Letter of Undertaking or Deed of Assignment is relevant, given that those documents now secure no money or debt, and hence that the residence of UBS witnesses that might establish the contractual claims formerly made is irrelevant. In that regard, Mr Stitt submits that the New South Wales proceedings are not fundamentally concerned with any of those documents but, rather, concern the misleading conduct of UBS AG, the issue of the lack of authority and the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Mr Stoljar in response submits that the contractual documents must remain relevant since they created and governed the banking relationship in which UBS AG provided services and the alleged acts of negligence and alleged representations occurred by reason of, and in the course of execution of, that relationship. Further, it is submitted that any alleged absence of authority must be assessed by reference to the procedures followed by UBS AG in Singapore to obtain appropriate client authorisations for transactions and that all the witnesses and documents relevant to that issue are in Singapore. As to any alleged fiduciary duty said to arise from the contractual relationship between the parties, it is submitted that this will be governed by the proper law of the contract, namely Singapore. 

197In relation to the provision of services by UBS AG, it is submitted by Mr Stoljar that a claim in negligence is governed, as to matters of substance, by the law of the place in which the services were provided (in this case Singapore). In relation to the alleged misrepresentation and misleading or deceptive conduct, it is submitted that the relevant place is where the representation was relied and acted upon (and Mr Stoljar submits that Chong J was correct in his opinion that this was Singapore). On this issue, if what is submitted is that the substantive law that would be applied (in accordance with the conflict of law rules in this jurisdiction in relation to the tort of misrepresentation or negligent misstatement or for misleading and deceptive conduct would be Singapore) I am not persuaded that this would be the case. I note that the general rule is that the tort is committed in the place where the statement was directed. The learned authors of Nygh's Conflict of Laws in Australia (8 th ed) relying upon Voth, Delco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated and Ors (2000) 100 FCR 385, Aussie Home Security Pty Ltd v Sales Systems Australia Pty Ltd (2000) 172 ALR 141 and Hunter Grain Pty Ltd v Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd (1993) 117 ALR 507, state: 

...the tort is committed at the place where it was directed, whether or not it was there acted upon, provided it was a place where it could have been reasonably anticipated that it would be received by the plaintiff or brought to the attention of the plaintiff, even if in fact it is received by the plaintiff elsewhere. The place where the statement was acted upon is not by itself relevant. 

198Reference was made by Mr Stitt in this regard to what was said in John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson (2000) 203 CLR 503 at 538 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; and Usines Renault v Zhang at [66] and [75] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. 

199I have cited earlier the passage in Voth in which the place of commission of the tort involving the alleged negligent accounting advice was said to be the place where the advice was received. There, with respect to cross border communications, their Honours (deriving this principle from Diamond) said: 

If a statement is directed from one place to another place where it is known or even anticipated that it will be received by the plaintiff, there is no difficulty in saying that the statement was, in substance, made at the place to which it was directed, whether or not it is there acted upon. And the same would seem to be true if the statement is directed to a place from where it ought reasonably to be expected that it will be brought to the attention of the plaintiff, even if it is brought to the attention in some third place. 

200Voth focuses on the intention of the party communicating the statement. The majority of the High Court held that it is the place where it is reasonably expected that the receiving party will receive it that is relevant (whether or not that is actually the place of receipt). 

201Similarly, Delco and Aussie Home Security are consistent with the principle established above by Voth and extended its application to claims of misleading and deceptive conduct claimed under the Trade Practices Act . 

202In Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575, in the context of a defamation claim, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed generally at 606 that locating the place of commission of a tort is not always easy, commenting that ""In the end the question is 'where in substance did this cause of action arise'? In cases, like trespass or negligence, where some quality of the defendant's conduct is critical, it will usually be very important to look to where the defendant acted, not to where the consequences of the conduct were felt"". 

203Hunter Grain illustrates the proposition that misrepresentation or misleading conduct, for the purposes of determining the proper law, is not concerned with the jurisdiction where damage accrues. Sheppard J at 520-521 said that: 

... the actionable wrong relied upon in this case arises out of misleading or deceptive conduct said to have been engaged in by the parties sued. That conduct, so far as each of the defendants was concerned, was committed entirely in the United States. 

204An assessment of the three groups of factors leads me to the conclusion that the most significant connection is with Singapore (that being where the account was opened, the banking services were provided and the place contemplated in the transaction documents as the non-exclusive place for resolution of disputes). The alleged misrepresentations or misleading and deceptive conduct were, however, received in New South Wales and, on the authorities referred to above, acted upon by the giving of instructions in New South Wales. (Although Chong J placed weight on the business efficacy of such transactions and seems to have accepted that the place at which instructions were given by Mr Tyne was fortuitous, it remains a connecting factor on the authorities to which I have referred above.) As to the place of business of the respective parties, this was in different jurisdictions, such that this seems to be a neutral factor. As to the question of convenience, this seems to me to be weighted in favour of Singapore, particularly as Mr Betsalel is resident there or (if he moves to Hong Kong) not far away. (I note that he has apparently professed a willingness to travel to Australia to give evidence but I consider the submissions made by Mr Stoljar as to the practical difficulties if he is not compellable (let alone not contactable) to have considerable force.) 

205In light of the conclusions reached by Chong J (following his analysis of the pleadings and of Mr Gleeson's expert opinion) as to the operation of the law in Singapore, it is difficult to find that there are any substantial juridical advantages in the ability of the Telesto parties here to invoke the statutory provisions in relation to misleading and deceptive conduct, although I note that there is weight to be accorded to the public policy underpinning this legislation as a factor pointing to this jurisdiction. 

206While the substantive law to govern the claims made by the Telesto parties in relation to the tort and misleading and deceptive conduct claims seems to me to be the law of this forum, the other claims raised by the Telesto parties I accept are likely to be governed by the law of Singapore. I also note that the commencement of the proceedings in this jurisdiction by Argot is in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in its contractual arrangements. 

207As to the enforceability of any declaratory or costs judgment obtained in Singapore, Mr Stitt places weight on the fact that the primary relief now sought in Singapore (a negative declaration) could not be enforced in New South Wales and that it was said in Henry (at [39]) that the fact that the order of the foreign court would not be enforced in Australia ""will ordinarily dispose of any suggestion that the local proceedings should not continue"". Mr Stoljar's response, in effect, is that this is a neutral factor as this is not a case in which any judgment obtained by UBS AG in Singapore would depend for its practical efficacy upon enforcement against assets situated in Australia. (As UBS AG is carrying on business in Singapore, I would assume it has assets there against which the Telesto parties, if they there made and were successful in the making of claims such as those in the current proceedings, could enforce the judgment so obtained by them.) 

208As to discretionary matters, it is submitted by Mr Stitt that the inference to be drawn from the continuation of the Singapore proceedings (despite Telesto's indebtedness being extinguished) is that this is merely a platform by which UBS AG seeks to deny the New South Wales proceedings. I do not accept that such an inference can be drawn having regard to the fact that the declaratory relief was sought from the outset and there remains a claim for indemnity costs. I accept Mr Stoljar's submission that there is no basis for this Court to find that the 'dominant purpose' of UBS AG in instituting the Singapore proceedings was to prevent the Telesto parties from pursuing remedies in Australia. 

209The factors referred to above must also be considered in circumstances where the effect of not granting a stay of the proceedings would be to expose the parties to the very real prospect of a duplicity of litigation. In this regard, I place weight on the observations of Jacobson J in Armacel in not dissimilar circumstances. There, an anti-suit injunction having been sought in proceedings in New South Wales in circumstances where the same controversy had been set down for hearing in the United States, Jacobson J observed that the problems which arise if the same controversy is to be litigated in different countries which have jurisdiction with respect to the same matter are such that, prima facie, the continuation of one or other of them must be seen as vexatious or oppressive in the sense stated in Voth, referring there to Henry v Henry at 591, and went on to note that the anti-suit injunction had been sought after the US District Court had determined that it had jurisdiction and after it had provisionally listed the matter for hearing. His Honour considered that in those circumstances ""To ask me to now grant anti-suit relief would be invidious and the reverse of comity: The Angelic Grace "" and concluded that the proceeding in the Federal Court was vexatious in the Voth sense. His Honour refused to grant an anti-suit injunction restraining Smurfit from continuing the proceeding in the US District Court and granted a temporary stay of the proceedings in this jurisdiction. (I note that his Honour came to that conclusion even though it had been acknowledged by Smurfit's legal counsel in the US District Court proceedings that the decision by Smurfit to commence suit in the United States was a tactical decision as to the selection of the forum and where the proceedings could be ""expeditiously forwarded"".) 

210Here, the Telesto parties are seeking to continue proceedings that, at least having regard to what was said by their Counsel in Singapore, will raise fundamentally the same issues as those to be dealt with in Singapore in circumstances where (although the matter has not there progressed to the point where it has been listed for hearing, provisionally or otherwise), the court in Singapore has not only accepted that it has jurisdiction but has entertained two contested hearings in which, at the heart of the matters before the court, has been the forum in which the dispute should be resolved. There is a substantial connection between the disputes raised in this forum and that to be heard in the Singapore forum (indeed, for Argot, the commencement of the proceedings here is contrary to the exclusive jurisdiction clause in its Letter of Undertaking). It seems to me that in those circumstances it would be vexatious and oppressive of the Telesto parties (in the sense of the objective effect on UBS AG of their conduct) now to pursue a course of conduct that will have the inevitable result of exposing UBS AG to the risk of conflicting judgments across two jurisdictions. The significance of the stay having been granted (and upheld on appeal) in Singapore is that a refusal to stay the proceedings in this Court must have the result that the two proceedings will continue. 

211I have adverted earlier to the submission by Mr Stitt as to the relevance of the fact that before Chong J issued his decision on appeal (unbeknownst to him or to Telesto) the debt had been extinguished. It is submitted that Chong J may well have not found as he did had his Honour known the primary relief in the Singapore proceedings was merely declaratory in nature and that insofar as an anti-suit injunction invokes an equitable remedy (and the court is exercising an equitable power when making such an order) (Mr Stitt referring to British Airways Board v Laker Airways Limited [1985] 1 AC 58 (HL), 80H - 81G; Barclays Bank plc v Homan [1993] BCLC 680, 686-88 (Hoffman J); Turner v Grovit [2002] 1 WLR 107 (HL) at [22]; Ellerman Lines Limited v Read [1928] 2 KB 144 per Atkin LJ), UBS AG was obliged to act with equity and good conscience when seeking the anti-suit injunction and was thus obliged to inform Chong J before judgment was given that the debt no longer existed and had been extinguished. It is submitted that such a matter may well have had a determinative effect upon his Honour's decision whether to grant the relief at all and as to costs and that the fact that UBS AG failed to do so is ""highly suggestive of an agenda to frustrate the New South Wales proceedings"". 

212In response, Mr Stoljar submits that the submission as to a failure to act with equity and good conscience (by reason of the non-disclosure to Chong J, some 6 weeks after his Honour had reserved judgment, that the debt had been extinguished) should be rejected. Mr Stoljar points out that UBS AG twice notified Telesto, in writing, of its intention to realise the collateral shortly prior to doing so; that at all times, Telesto had the ability to gain access to the electronic statements which revealed the precise status of the account and to the 'retained mail' or e-banking portal; and that neither Telesto nor either of the other Telesto parties took any step to notify Chong J of the extinguishment of the debt nor suggested to UBS AG that it would be appropriate to do so or that this would be a matter of any significance to his Honour. 

213As I have noted earlier, although it was at all times open to the Telesto parties to check the e-banking portal, subsequent enquiries by UBS AG have revealed that it had not done so since 2010. Therefore, the most I can draw from the above is that the Telesto parties appear not to have considered that the possibility or intention of UBS AG to sell down the collateral (once UBS AG's intention to do so was made known to them) was a relevant matter to be brought to the attention of his Honour. 

214As for the position of UBS AG, it is submitted by Mr Stoljar that there was no reason for UBS AG to consider that the extinguishment of the debt was a matter of any significance in respect of the issues argued before Chong J but that in any event, this Court should not now speculate, and there is no reason to suppose, that Chong J may not have found as he did had the extinguishment of the debt been disclosed to the Court prior to delivery of his Honour's reasons for judgment. Mr Stoljar points out that his Honour's judgment does not place any significance upon the enforceability in Australia of any judgment obtained in the Singapore proceedings and submits that there is no basis for concluding that the unenforceability in Australia of a Singapore non-monetary judgment would have been material to his Honour's determination, having regard to the strength of the considerations supporting the conclusion that an anti-suit injunction should be granted. 

215In relation to this issue, not having been privy to the argument before his Honour, it is impossible for me to assess whether the matter is one that his Honour would have expected should be drawn to his attention while the judgment was reserved. Nor would it be appropriate for me to speculate on what his Honour might have done or to express any view as to what might have been the import on the reasons for judgment of any such disclosure. I accept the force of the submission by Mr Stoljar that if there is an issue in relation to this aspect of the matter it is one better dealt with by raising it with the Court in Singapore. I am not persuaded that a finding as to lack of good conscience would be appropriate, nor am I persuaded that this is something which, as a matter of discretion, should lead me to refuse any relief that I otherwise am prepared to grant. 

216In this context, Mr Stoljar notes that the Telesto parties cannot prosecute the proceedings in this Court without being in contempt of the High Court of Singapore (reference being made to Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [1995] FCA 1563 at [24] where Lindgren J acknowledged if an ""anti-anti-suit injunction"" were to be made in New York it would have the effect that an application for an anti-suit injunction in Australia could not be made without the applicant being in contempt of the court in New York). 

217The significance of the fact that there is no longer a monetary claim being pursued in Singapore, in the context of the application now before me, in my view is not as to the rights or wrongs of the fact that it was not drawn to his Honour's attention but to the question as to whether the scope of the defence by the Telesto parties to those proceedings will encompass the matters raised in the proceedings they have commenced in this jurisdiction. If it will not, then much of the force of the current application by UBS AG in my view falls away. 

Conclusion 

218I am satisfied that if the same, or in substance the same, controversy is to be litigated in two separate sets of proceedings in two different countries each of which has jurisdiction with respect to the same matter, then the continuation of the present proceedings (having regard to the strong connections between the subject matter of the claim and the jurisdiction in Singapore; the contest that has already been determined at considerable expense in relation to this issue in Singapore; and the abuse of process involved in the vexatious and oppressive conduct of exposing UBS AG to the cost of proceedings in two countries and the risk of conflicting judgments) would be vexatious or oppressive to UBS AG in the sense stated in Voth and that this Court should strive to avoid such a result. In those circumstances I would hold that this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum for the purposes of the test in Voth . 

219If, however, the controversy to be litigated in Singapore will not overlap to the extent that was considered likely when the matter was before Chong J, then I do not consider that it would be vexatious and oppressive for the Telesto parties to continue the present proceedings in which relief is sought in part under forum statutes in respect of which the courts have recognised there is a strong public policy in favour of the protection of those doing business in this jurisdiction (and even though I recognise that this would seem to involve a clear breach of the orders made against the Telesto parties in Singapore and would presumably expose them to charges for contempt according to the applicable law in Singapore). While I consider it invidious to be placed in the position where the Court might be seen to condone a breach of the anti-suit injunction (and refusal of a stay would have the effect of forcing UBS AG into the position of defending proceedings continued in breach of that order), that seems to me to be the result of the authorities that make it clear that such injunctions operate only in personam; that the courts will not enforce non-monetary orders of this kind; and that unless the present jurisdiction is a clearly inappropriate forum no stay should be granted. 

220The difficulty I have is that it is not clear to me into what category the present case will fall without knowing what matters are ultimately to be raised in the defence of the Singapore proceedings. In Sterling Pharmaceuticals , Lockhart J pointed to the substantial difference between a motion for a permanent stay or dismissal of a proceeding and a motion for a temporary stay or lengthy adjournment of the case, noting that the court remains in full control of the proceedings in the latter instances. In Armacel , Jacobson J granted a stay with liberty to apply (noting that the court must remain in control of its own interlocutory orders and citing Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Philip Morris Incorporated (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 178). His Honour there foreshadowed that if the United States court declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction to apply the Trade Practices Act then it might be appropriate to lift the stay ([118]) and that, having regard to the ordinary vicissitudes of litigation in another country, there might be other circumstances existing in the litigation in the United States that would make it appropriate to consider such an application in the future. 

221Bearing in mind the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to ensure that there is no abuse of its own processes, I have concluded that the appropriate relief is not to grant a permanent stay at this stage but, rather, to grant a temporary stay. 

222In my view it would be appropriate for the stay to be granted pending the outcome of the claim for declaratory relief in the Singapore proceedings. I did consider whether the stay should be limited to the period pending the closure of pleadings in the Singapore court (at which time it would be known what defences were to be pleaded by the Telesto parties). However, that would not take into account the possibility of amendment to the pleadings at a later stage. Moreover, it seems to me that it is not consistent with the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in dispute in the proceedings to permit a situation to arise where the parties might be embroiled in litigation here in relation to the substantive claims pleaded by the Telesto parties (assuming they were not raised as defences in the Singapore proceedings and the stay were then to be lifted) only then for it to be determined in Singapore that the estoppel/compromise claim was made out. 

223As I did not explore with Counsel during the hearing raise the duration of any temporary stay I might be prepared to grant in lieu of a permanent stay, I will defer making orders until after I have enquired whether Counsel would wish to address me on that question. I will also hear Counsel on the question of costs as necessary. 

Orders 

224For the reasons set out above I consider that the appropriate order is temporarily to stay the present proceedings pending the determination in the Singapore proceedings of the application by UBS AG for declaratory relief and to give the parties liberty to apply to restore the proceedings at that stage. However, I will not make final orders until I have heard any submissions from the parties on the proposed orders and as to costs.

2708621,HARDIE v REGINA; PHILLIPSEN v REGINA [2012] NSWCCA 6,"Judgment 

1RS HULME J: At about 4.00 am on 24 October 2009, Ms Simone Wilkie, then aged 20, was asleep in her bed. One of her two flatmates was also in the premises. The applicants and Ms Melinda Bird, after some substantial ingestion of alcohol, caught a taxi to those premises and after receiving no response to knocking on the front door entered the premises through an open window. Leading the other two, Ms Hardie went to Ms Wilkie's bedroom where she struck Ms Wilkie as hard as she could 30 to 40 times to the head, neck, torso, arms and legs. The attack was protracted. In addition to the blows, a metal deodorant can was thrown at Ms Wilkie striking her in the wrist. 

2Ms Wilkie's flatmate unsuccessfully attempted to drag Ms Hardie off but ultimately Ms Wilkie managed to push Ms Hardie away. 

3After the beating of Ms Wilkie stopped, Ms Bird put in a bag a number of items, being a laptop computer, a DVD player, a handbag, hairdryer and some electrical games and DVDs. As they were leaving the house, Ms Hardie picked up a scooter and threw it at the front door, smashing the glass panel. Ms Bird caused further damage to the panel with her fists. 

4Ms Wilkie sustained very significant injuries - concussion, extensive bruising to her face and cheek, multiple abrasions to her face, injuries to her jaw, neck and left forearm, permanent damage and reduced function to her jaw, a permanent hearing loss in her left ear in the order of 40 to 50 decibels, which now requires her to wear a hearing aid, chronic headaches, sleep disturbance and nausea. She has also suffered a serious post-traumatic stress disorder and requires treatment from both a psychologist and a psychiatrist. Her psychological difficulties have precluded her working since the assault. 

5The only evidence of motive was that there had been some sort of altercation between Ms Wilkie and her flatmates on the one hand and Ms Hardie's sister on the other and Ms Hardie had been informed that Ms Wilkie had attempted to sleep with Ms Hardie's boyfriend. 

6Arising from this incident, Ms Hardie pleaded guilty to three offences. They, the section of the Crimes Act 1900 proscribing them and the maximum penalty for each is as follows:- 

1. Entering a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence, vis, assault - s.114(1)(d) - seven years. 

2. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company - s.59(2) - seven years. 

3. Intentionally damaging property in company - s.195(1A) - six years. 

7Ms Phillipsen also pleaded guilty to three offences. Similar details are as follows:- 

1. Remaining in a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence, vis, assault - s.114(1)(d) - seven years. 

2. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and in a dwelling - s.59(2) - seven years. 

3. Stealing in a dwelling - s.148 - seven years. 

8Ms Bird also pleaded guilty and was sentenced but nothing turns on her charges or sentences and they need not be detailed. 

9Colefax SC DCJ recorded that each offender had strong subjective circumstances. Ms Hardie was almost 21 at the time and had no prior convictions. His Honour said she was, therefore, entitled to rely on good character. She has a child, born about seven weeks prior to the sentences. Since her arrest she has lived with her mother and was significantly involved in the care of her siblings, one of whom was as young as seventeen months and one of whom suffers a chronic disability. Ms Hardie left school at seventeen after obtaining her School Certificate. She subsequently obtained a Certificate in Business Administration. Prior to the offences, she suffered significantly with depression and, as might be expected, this worsened considerably after the offences. 

10Colefax DCJ recorded that Ms Hardie had not consumed alcohol since the offences, had undergone psychological counselling and at no time had consumed illicit drugs. His Honour found she had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

11Ms Phillipsen was just over 18 at the time of the offences. She had three convictions as a juvenile. His Honour recorded they could not be held against her but she could not rely on previous good character. She suffered an abusive and neglectful childhood. Prior to the offences, she had a significant problem with alcohol but since them she has totally abstained from alcohol and other drugs. His Honour recorded she had made a serious and successful effort to reform her life and found she had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

12After referring to these subjective circumstances, which he described as strong, his Honour went on to remark:- 

""Those subjective circumstances, however, cannot distract the Court from the extremely serious nature of the offences which have been committed, particularly by Ms Hardie and Ms Phillipsen. In relation to those two offenders, no sentence other than a period of full-time imprisonment is appropriate, although the length of the period of imprisonment will be modified by taking into account those subjective circumstances."" 

13After recording that each offender was entitled to a discount of 25% for her plea and finding special circumstances because of the applicants' ages, that they had not previously been imprisoned, and both had good prospects of rehabilitation which would be enhanced by a longer period on parole, his Honour, on 26 August 2011, sentenced the applicants as follows:- 

(1) In the case of Ms Hardie, wholly concurrent sentences of imprisonment for one year and eight months, including non-parole period periods of 10 months, both such periods commencing on 26 August 2011. 

(2) In the case of Ms Phillipsen, wholly concurrent sentences of imprisonment for one year and six months, including non-parole periods of nine months, both such periods commencing on 26 August 2011. 

14Each applicant has appealed upon the grounds that:- 

(1) The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take the proper steps in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the applicant in that the sentencing judge erred in failing to consider that alternatives to full-time imprisonment were available and whether any of those alternatives ought to be utilised. 

(2) The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 

Ground 1 

15In support of the first ground of appeal, reliance was placed on remarks of Howie J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, in R v Zamagias (2002) NSWCCA 17 at [24] et seq:- 

""24. There is a preliminary question to be addressed and, depending upon the answer to that question, two further steps may have to be undertaken before the ultimate sentence is imposed. 

25. The preliminary question to be asked and answered is, whether there are any alternatives to the imposition of a term of imprisonment. Section 5 of the Act prohibits a court from imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no other penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. It should be noted that at this stage in the process the only consideration is whether a sentence of imprisonment should be imposed and not whether that sentence should be suspended. Notwithstanding that s.12, which provides the power to suspend a sentence, is contained in Division 3 of Partt 2 of the Act under the general heading ""Non-Custodial Alternatives"", a suspended sentence is not an alternative to which s.5 relates: JCE (2000) 120 A Crim R 18 at 15. That is because a sentence cannot be suspended until it has been imposed: it is the execution of the sentence that is suspended not its imposition. 

26. Having determined that there is no other penalty appropriate other than a sentence of imprisonment, the court is next to determine what the term of that sentence should be: R v Foster (2001) NSWCCA 215 at 30. This has been regarded as the first step of a two-step approach in the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment, see R v Blackman and Walters (2001) NSWCCA 121 at 50 to 52; JCE at 17. The determination of the term is to be made without regard to whether the sentence will be immediately served or the manner in which it is to be served. This is because any of the alternatives available in respect of a sentence of imprisonment can only be considered once the sentence has been imposed: see s.6 (periodic detention order), s.7 (home detention order) and s.12. It follows that the term of the sentence cannot be influenced by what order might be made after the sentence has been imposed. For example, it cannot be increased because it is to be served by way of periodic detention: R v Wegener (1999) NSWCCA 405, or by home detention: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 249. Nor can the term be reduced because an otherwise appropriate alternative is unavailable: R v T ( NSWCCA, 19 June 1995) 

27. ... 

28. Once the term of the sentence has been determined, the court is then to consider whether any alternative to full-time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised. The availability of an alternative to full-time custody will generally be governed by the length of the term that has been determined subject to the restrictions or pre-conditions imposed by the legislature on a particular sentencing alternative, see for example s.77 of the Act with respect to home detention. But the appropriateness of an alternative to full-time custody will depend on a number of factors, one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment. The court in choosing an alternative to full-time custody cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative the less likely it is fulfil all the purposes of punishment. R v Jurisic at 250B."" 

16It may be accepted that Howie J's remarks accurately and logically reflect the various steps and the order of them as flow from the terms of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . However, it does not follow that a judge must expressly follow this order and refer to all of the steps in circumstances where the ultimate result is, in the judge's view, clear. Howie J made this clear at [30] of his remarks in the case just referred to. Basten JA made a similar point when, in Amado v R (2011) NSWCCA 197 at 5, his Honour observed:- 

""It was unrealistic to suppose that the Court actually reaches its conclusion by proceeding mechanically from step one to step three."" 

17Certainly, in many cases the risk of error may increase if a judge does not expressly advert to some or all of the possibilities or steps referred to in Howie J's remarks. But there are many cases where a sentence of full-time imprisonment is so obviously demanded that the procedure envisaged by Howie J can properly be foregone. 

18Not only did his Honour make the remarks that I have quoted, including the passage that no sentence other than full-time imprisonment is appropriate. The sentence imposed during the same proceedings on Ms Bird was a suspended sentence. In those circumstances it cannot be thought that his Honour's failure to expressly deal with the matter by way of the steps referred to by Justice Howie was erroneous or indicative of error. Ground 1 fails. 

Ground 2 

19The seriousness with which the law regards the offences committed by the applicants is apparent from the penalties provided. To take but the first offence, s.114(1)(d) provides that:- 

""Any person who:- 

(d) enters or remains in or upon any part of a building or any land occupied or used in connection therewith with intent to commit an indictable offence on or upon the building shall be liable to imprisonment for seven years."" 

20Thus, even without the actual commission of some other offence, the penalty for entering, or simply being there, with the relevant intent, exposes an offender to the risk of a lengthy prison term. 

21The view of the legislature has been echoed by the courts in numerous cases. People are entitled to the privacy of their homes. Equally, they are entitled to freedom from assault. 

22And while judging offences of the general nature of those committed by the applicants the courts have regarded it as appropriate to look at the motivation for the offences - see eg R v Lovell & Dominey (2006) NSWCCA 222 and Smith v R (2011) NSWCCA 209 and the cases therein cited. It is clear that general deterrence is an important factor in cases such as this. Persons must be discouraged from seeking to themselves right what they perceive to be injustices or punish those they think, rightly or wrongly, have wronged them. 

23Retribution is also a matter to which principles of sentencing require that regard be had. It is particularly important in this case where Ms Wilkie has suffered not only the pain which must have been associated with her physical injuries but the ongoing effects of post traumatic stress disorder and permanent hearing loss. 

24Before Colefax DCJ it was submitted that his Honour could not take into account this hearing loss because to do so would be to have regard to a more serious offence, ie, assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. His Honour rejected the submission, although saying that he did not regard that injury as a circumstance of aggravation. 

25The consequences to the victim, including the hearing loss, were included as part of the Statement of Agreed Facts, upon which the hearing before Colefax DCJ proceeded and, although the matter is not entirely clear, probably in the circumstances where the Statement of Agreed Facts and the charges - which would seem to have been less serious than those on which the applicants were committed for trial - were both the product of negotiations between the parties. Be that as it may, the borderline between actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm is not always clear and in these circumstances his Honour was entitled to approach the matter upon the basis that the hearing loss and other injuries, although obviously serious, were not so bad as to amount to grievous bodily harm. 

26Recognition of course had to be afforded to the ages of the applicants and to his Honour's favourable, or relatively favourable, view of their pasts and of their prospects of rehabilitation. However, the extended nature of the attack on Ms Wilkie, the fact that it occurred following an unlawful entry into her home and the extent of the injury to her, mean that a severe sentence was appropriate. Not only are the sentences not manifestly excessive, when regard is had to the maximum penalties of seven years imprisonment for most of their offences, the applicants are fortunate that their sentences were not higher. 

27I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeals. 

28BASTEN JA: I agree with Hulme J. Ground 1 seeks to invoke the requirements set out in s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) ("" Sentencing Procedure Act "") to the effect that a court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. There are concerns as to how that should be dealt with in the course of expressing reasons for sentence; I refer to the comments I made in that regard in Amado v R [2011] NSWCCA 197, at [5]-[7]. 

29There is also a question as to the precise relationship between that obligation and the power to suspend a sentence pursuant to s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act , but that issue does not arise in the present case. More significantly, if there were an error in the way his Honour had approached the expression of his satisfaction in that regard, it would merely give rise to an issue as to whether this Court should re-sentence the applicants. For the reasons given by Hulme J, I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed were in any sense other than sentences warranted at law. I therefore agree that there should be a grant of leave to appeal but the appeals of each offender should be dismissed. 

30SCHMIDT J: I agree with both Justice Hulme and Justice Basten. 

31BASTEN JA: The orders of the Court are as Justice Hulme indicated: leave to appeal is granted in respect of each applicant. Each appeal is dismissed.

		22 February 2012",2012-02-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708626,R v Smith [2012] NSWSC 38,"SENTENCE  1On 2 November 2011 Joey Aaron Smith was charged by way of indictment that, on 25 April 2009, at Busby NSW, he murdered David Wayne Boyce.  The accused pleaded not guilty.  Accordingly, a jury was empanelled and the trial proceeded.  The substantial issue raised at the trial was self-defence.  On 1 December 2011 the jury found the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.  Factual Background  2I should preface my remarks by noting that a number of the people involved in the events leading up to the tragic death of Mr Boyce were under 18 years of age at the time.  As such, s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 provides that they should not be identified.  I will therefore be referring to them and members of their families by using their initials only.   Those that are fully named were over 18 at the time.  3The following is a very brief summary of the factual background.  4The deceased, Wayne Boyce as he was generally called, was 23 years old at the time of his death.  The circumstances leading to his death had their genesis in a dispute between two young men (both of them under 18 at the time) called JT and AH.  The offender was a friend of AH's and Mr Boyce was a friend of JT's.  On the evening of Friday 24 April 2009 JT was at his home in T ... Street, Busby together with two friends, JP and JP's girlfriend RM.  JT's parents were also at home at the time.  RM was a friend of two girls called Danielle and Natalie, both of whom were, by chance, with AH that evening, as was the offender, Joey Smith.  The offender had known AH for many years, and they were close friends.  At one stage quite early in the evening, JT intervened in a telephone conversation between RM and Danielle, and demanded to talk to AH.  The two young men then had an argument over the phone.  Not long afterwards AH and his three companions drove to Busby, parking their car around the corner from the T home.  AH and the offender walked around to the home, and JT and JP came out to the front garden to meet them.  There JT and AH became involved in a verbal confrontation.  Each of them was challenging the other to throw the first punch, but neither of them did so.  The situation was defused when JT's father came out of the house and apologised to AH on behalf of his son.  He shook AH's hand, and JT shook hands with the offender.  AH, together with the offender and the two girls, then returned to their car and drove off.  5It is worthy of note here that the evidence indicates that the offender, Joey Smith, occupied something of a peace-making role during this episode.  Having seen that JP was carrying a metal pole, he took it from him and threw it away, over a fence.  6Unfortunately, the way this confrontation ended only served to fuel JT's anger.  He was concerned that AH and his friends would see it as a backing down on his, JT's, part.  He was saying:  ""Now they will think they can walk all over me.""  Thereafter more telephone calls were made between the two groups.  JT was told that AH and his companions would be returning to the T house in order that the two of them, JT and AH, could have a ""one-on-one"" fight, as they put it.  JT was concerned that AH would bring more people with him as supporters.  So he telephoned his friend Wayne Boyce, and asked him to be on the alert to come and assist when called upon.  7JT was correct in his apprehension that AH would get more people to accompany him on his second trip to the T home.  By the time AH returned, at about 3.00 on the Saturday morning, there were eleven in his group, all travelling in a very large van which parked around the corner from the T home.  These eleven comprised the four people who had been there previously, and seven others.  Amongst the new additions were two whom I will be referring to later, namely Jamie Bargachoun and Alecks Tukacovic.  By that time also there were seven people in the T home, as they had been joined by two of JT's friends, a male and a female.  8When JT first saw AH's group approach, he telephoned Mr Boyce and asked him to come immediately.  The deceased at that time was with five friends, three males and two females, in an apartment at Wentworthville.  They left straight away in the deceased's four-wheel-drive vehicle, and arrived at the T home not long afterwards.  The deceased, who was in the front passenger's seat, was the first to get out.  He jumped out as the vehicle was still coming to a stop outside the house.  By that time there were quite a number of people in the front yard, although by no means the total number of the two groups.  Most of the T group, including JT himself, stayed inside the house for much if not all of this confrontation, and several of the AH group stayed well away from the house and its precincts.  9When the Mr Boyce got out of the vehicle he was carrying a baseball bat which he had brought from the apartment in Wentworthville.  He walked, or ran, virtually straight across the front garden to a point near some trees.  There he had a confrontation with the offender which culminated in the offender inflicting a single stab wound to the deceased's left side.  Tragically, the wound penetrated the right ventricle of the deceased's heart, and he immediately fell to the ground.  Subsequent attempts to revive him, first by JT's mother, and later by paramedics, were unsuccessful.  The post mortem examination showed that he died of blood loss.  10Almost all of those who were present at or around the T house at the time gave evidence for the Crown during the offender's trial.  The two exceptions, apart from the offender himself, were AH and Jamie Bargachoun, both of whom had pleaded guilty to manslaughter as a result of Mr Boyce's killing, and were still awaiting sentence.  Accordingly, 20 eye-witnesses were called to give evidence for the Crown:  all seven who had been in the T house, eight of the eleven in the AH group, and the five people who had accompanied Wayne Boyce to the T house.  11Not surprisingly, given the speed at which the events occurred, together with the time of night and the considerable alcohol which had been consumed by many of those present, there were significant disparities between the various accounts of what happened when Mr Boyce first arrived outside the T home.  Indeed, fourteen of the twenty Crown witnesses did not see what happened immediately before the stabbing.  They were either inside the house, or outside the precincts of the house and garden, or looking in another direction.  Accordingly, only six Crown witnesses described the events immediately preceding the stabbing.  Given that self-defence was the principal issue in the trial, it was the events at that time which were of crucial importance to the jury's deliberations.  In addition to the Crown witnesses, the then accused, Joey Smith, gave evidence in his own case.  I think it is appropriate to commence with the account which he gave in his evidence, and then attempt to link it to the evidence given by the Crown witnesses.  I propose to do this very briefly.  The actual evidence went into a great deal of detail, which is unnecessary to traverse here.  12The offender said that the intention of AH and his companions, when they returned to the T house that night, was to watch AH and JT have a one-on-one fight.  After they had left the van and were walking towards the house, he had a conversation with AH, during which the latter lifted his T-shirt and revealed a knife underneath.  The offender immediately grabbed it from him, and put it in his own waistband.  His intention, he said, was to avert a situation where a dangerous weapon might be used during the anticipated fight involving AH.  In fact, no fight between AH and JT took place at all that night.  JT stayed inside the house almost the whole time.  13The offender said that when he first arrived at the edge of the garden, he saw someone standing beside a car in the driveway.  He, the offender, asked him whether JT was there.  The person replied that he was inside.  The offender asked him to go and get him.  Then, the offender said, he walked up to where Jamie Bargachoun was standing.  While he was there the four-wheel-drive arrived, and he saw someone with a baseball bat walking into the middle of the yard.  This was clearly Wayne Boyce.  RM, the girl who had been in the T home all evening, went up to Mr Boyce and said: ""Stop, they haven't done anything yet.  Relax.""  But, according to the offender, Mr Boyce took no notice of her and walked straight up to him, the offender.  They had never met before, but he said that Mr Boyce immediately took the baseball bat with both hands and swung it at him, just missing his head.  He raised it over his head to swing it again, and at that stage the offender took out the knife and swung it at his attacker.  Mr Boyce immediately fell back, and the offender realised that the knife had gone into him.  He had acted defensively, he said, and certainly did not intend to kill Mr Boyce.  14I do not propose to go through the details of what happened after the stabbing of Mr Boyce.  There were a number of further altercations between various members of the different groups.  The offender himself displayed a degree of aggression after the stabbing.  First, he swung the knife at a group of people, saying ""Go back inside the house and get the fuck away from me or I'll shank you.""  A little later, after JT had briefly emerged from the front door of the house and had struck AH in the back of the head, the offender assisted AH in smashing the front window of the T house with a pole which he had picked up from the ground.  Shortly after this the entire AH group left the T house.  They returned to the van and drove off.  Police and paramedics were called but, as indicated, were unable to revive Mr Boyce.  15Interestingly, none of the six eye-witnesses in the Crown case who saw the events leading up to the stabbing, described Mr Boyce as having swung his bat towards the offender.  Three of them said that he had swung it towards Jamie Bargachoun, and that the offender had intervened in order to protect Mr Bargachoun.  The jury was accordingly directed that the same principles applied to a killing done in defence of another person as to a killing done in self-defence.  16Moving on in time, it is apparent that after leaving the T home, the offender started to realise the enormity of what had happened.  He was described as saying, in the van:  ""I think I stabbed him ... fuck, fuck, fuck!""  He told Alecks Tukacovic, who had driven the van to the T house, but who had remained in it while the others went to the house, that he had stabbed a man in order to stop him hitting Jamie Bargachoun.  Later again, after the van had been driven to Alecks Tukacovic's house, Mr Tukacovic spoke to the offender and offered to dispose of the knife.  The offender gave it to him and Mr Tukacovic concealed it in a drain in front of his home where it was later recovered by the police.  17It is unnecessary for present purposes to describe the offender's movements later that night.  The following afternoon he was arrested at AH's home.  On the way to the police station he told police that they had the wrong person, and that he had been at home watching movies all of the previous night.  Later he admitted that this was a lie, but said that he was panicking at the time, when he realised that the victim of the stabbing had died.  18The offender was later charged with the murder of Wayne Boyce.  He offered to plead guilty to manslaughter before the Local Court committal proceedings commenced.  This offer was renewed shortly prior to trial.  Clearly he is entitled to a discount on sentence on this account, and I will be returning to discuss it later.  Meaning of Jury's Verdict  19In my view by far the most likely basis for the jury's verdict is that the offender used excessive force when seeking to defend himself.  During the sentencing proceedings Mr Steel, who appeared for the offender, submitted that the jury might have had a reasonable doubt as to whether the offender intended to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Boyce.  However, given that the offender admitted to deliberately stabbing Mr Boyce in order to defend himself, I cannot accept this to be a realistic possibility.  I therefore propose to sentence him on the basis of excessive self-defence.  20Accordingly I accept, for the purposes of sentencing, that the stabbing was done in circumstances where the offender genuinely believed that he was under attack and that it was necessary to do what he did in order to protect himself, but the force he in fact used was excessive in the circumstances.  Seriousness of the Offence  21The starting point in the offence of manslaughter is that a human life has been taken, in this case the life of a young man who did nothing more than agree with his friend JT to come and protect him and his group if necessary, and who was perhaps a little over-zealous in his attempts to do so.  As the Crown prosecutor has pointed out, the fact that a knife was used is an aggravating factor.  I have to accept, however, that the offender did not deliberately bring the knife with him intending to use it during this affray, but that he had it in the circumstances described in his evidence, namely that he had taken it from AH in order to ensure that AH could not use it in his anticipated fight with JT.  Accordingly, I cannot regard this as a significant aggravating factor.  22It is pertinent here to refer to the proceedings against AH and Jamie Bargachoun.  As already mentioned, both were charged with criminal offences as a result of the killing of Wayne Boyce.  They were initially charged with murder and other minor offences.  Both of them pleaded guilty to manslaughter, which plea was accepted by the Crown.  On 13 December 2011 they were sentenced by Justice Johnson of this Court.  Both were sentenced on the basis that they participated in an extended joint criminal enterprise in that they took part in an unlawful and dangerous act, an affray, in circumstances which objectively carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury being occasioned to a person.  23Dealing first with A H:  he was only 16 years and eight months old at the time of the offence, and was sentenced under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 . His Honour commented in his sentencing remarks that AH was responsible for setting in train the conflict which led to the groups of young men clashing outside the T house.  AH was armed with a metal pole during the confrontation, although he did not in fact use it.  His Honour considered that in his case the offence was an objectively serious one.  After applying a discount of 20% for his plea of guilty, his Honour sentenced him to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years.  In this regard, his Honour found that there were special circumstances which justified a departure from the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.  ( R v AH [2011] NSWSC 1535 )  24As for Mr Bargachoun, his Honour pointed out that he also was armed with a metal pole when he emerged from the van.  Unlike AH, Mr Bargachoun actually used his pole, striking one of the men from the T home very heavily on the shin.  There was no evidence that Mr Bargachoun engaged in any personal confrontation with Mr Boyce.  However his Honour concluded that he was a willing participant in the overall confrontation and he himself used violence in the course of the confrontation.  On that basis, his Honour considered that his crime was an objectively serious one.  After applying a discount of 20% for his plea of guilty, his Honour sentenced him to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and three months.  Again, his Honour made a finding that special circumstances existed.  ( R v Bargachoun [2011] NSWSC 1534 )  25Mr Steel accepts that the objective criminality of the present offender must be greater than that of AH or Mr Bargachoun, given that it was he who actually inflicted the stab wound which killed Mr Boyce.  26With this background I return to discuss the circumstances of the present offence.  Mr Steel submitted that the offender should be sentenced on the basis that he did not intend to kill Mr Boyce when he inflicted the fatal injury, and I accept this to be the case.  The offender acted very quickly in the heat of the moment, without any opportunity for reflection.  He swung the knife around and into the side of the deceased.  Although I find that he must have intended to really seriously injure Mr Boyce at the time, I do not think that his intention was to kill him.  As Mr Steel pointed out, the location of the wound to the side of the ribs was such that the offender may not have appreciated the potentially lethal consequences of a stab wound to this area.  Professor Duflou said that only a moderate amount of force was needed to inflict the fatal wound.  27The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years.  It has often been said that this offence covers a greater range of criminality than any other offence in the criminal calendar.  It can encompass offences which are only a little short of murder, at the higher end; down to practical jokes which have gone disastrously wrong at the bottom.  This being the case, it is very difficult to compare one case with another.  The scope for variation, both in the objective circumstances of each case and the subjective features of each offender, is virtually limitless.  There is no standard non-parole period, and the Court is not required to make a finding as to where the particular offence stands in relation to the notional middle point of objective seriousness.  In the present case, I find that it was an objectively serious offence of its kind:  more serious than that of AH or Mr Bargachoun, but still in the generally serious range.  The Offender's Subjective Circumstances  28The offender was only 18 years and three months old at the time of the offence.  He is now barely 21.  At the time of the offence he was living with his family at Hoxton Park, and was working for a company called Patti's Plant Hire, where his father had also been working for many years.  He is of part-Aboriginal descent, and has no criminal record of any kind.  Four character witnesses were called in the defence case.  One was the offender's paternal uncle, Darcy Smith, who is a shift supervisor for Juvenile Justice at Wagga Wagga.  He has known the offender all his life, and described him as ""a very respectful young person, very honest young kid, reliable and caring"".  The offender is the oldest of eight children, and has always assisted his mother in the care of his younger siblings.  Mr Smith said the offender was ""one of the most placid young persons I have seen"".  29Leonard Donaldson, who had previously worked for Patti's Plant Hire, and was a retired police officer, described the offender's family as ""a great family"".  The offender himself, he said, has always been a good, reliable worker and a ""meek and mild person"".  30Donna Carter, the foster-sister of the offender's mother, had also known the offender all his life.  She said that he was ""an honest, reliable, loyal young man"".  She had never heard of him being aggressive or violent.  31Finally, Lawrence Lockhart, the owner of Patti's Plant Hire, gave evidence in which he described the offender as ""a good kid, hardworking, obliging"".  He said that the offender got on well with everyone, and he had never known him to be violent or aggressive.  32Accordingly, the offender comes before the Court as a person of otherwise impeccable character.  This is in contrast to AH and Jamie Bargachoun, both of whom had a prior criminal history, notwithstanding their youth.  Indeed at the time of the offence, AH was on bail, having been charged less than a month earlier with an offence of aggravated break and enter while in company.  33I accept that the offender is and has always been genuinely remorseful for this offence.  He first displayed his remorse later on the night of the stabbing, when he started to realise the enormity of what had happened.  All his actions and expressions since then have been indicative of great remorse, which I accept is entirely genuine.  This was also indicated by his offers to plead guilty to manslaughter.  34In the light of all the evidence, I am satisfied that this offence was entirely out of character, and that the offender is most unlikely to re-offend.  Accordingly, neither personal deterrence nor rehabilitation has a significant role to play in the sentencing process.  35It is also appropriate to take account of the offender's youth.  He was, as already indicated, only 18 years and 3 months old when he committed this offence.  I think it highly likely that his immaturity at the time was a significant factor in his over-reacting to the perceived threat which was presented by the deceased.  This being the case, the authorities indicate that greater emphasis in the sentencing process should be given to rehabilitation rather than to deterrence or retribution.  36It is apparent  from all I have said that every aspect of the offender's subjective features is favourable, and deserving of leniency.  Other Sentencing Considerations  37As already indicated, the offender offered to plead guilty to manslaughter,  both before the committal proceedings and again shortly before the trial.  Given that the charge was murder, this plea was not accepted by the Crown.  Both AH and Jamie Bargachoun received discounts of 20% for their pleas of guilty.  Mr Steel submitted that the discount should be greater in the present case.  However I am unable to accept this proposition.  In the circumstances, I propose to apply a discount of 20%.  38The offender was on bail for most of the time between the commission of the offence and his conviction, a total of over two and a half years.  The bail conditions were very onerous, with a curfew between 8.00 pm and 6 am, a daily reporting requirement, and a prohibition on leaving his residence except in the company of one of his parents or another nominated adult relative.  This is a relevant matter to be taken into account on sentence.  39The Crown concedes that, given the offender's youth and his prior good character, he is entitled to a finding of special circumstances under s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . This is an appropriate concession, and I will therefore be varying the normal ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term.  Victim Impact Statements  40Extremely moving victim impact statements were read in Court during the sentencing proceedings by or on behalf of Wayne Boyce's mother, Valentina Boyle, his father, David Boyce, and his six siblings:  Anna, Rebecca, Tiffany, Samantha, Nicholas and Vashti.  These are testament to the great qualities of this young man who will tragically never see his two young sons grow up.  On behalf of the Court, and on my own behalf, I offer sincere condolences to his family and friends.  I take the statements into account in the manner provided by the law.  Conclusion  41Finally it is necessary to bring all these strands together and reach an appropriate verdict.  Some of the different considerations point in opposite directions.  The seriousness of the offence, and the fact that a valuable young life was lost, point in one direction, whereas the offender's personal considerations all point the other way.  Taking into account the time already spent in custody, the sentence is to date from 10 October 2011.  The following sentence is reached after applying the 20% discount referred to earlier.  42Joey Aaron Smith, you are convicted of the manslaughter of David Wayne Boyce.  You are sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of three years, commencing on 10 October 2011 and expiring on 9 October 2014, with a balance of term of three years, commencing on 10 October 2014 and expiring on 9 October 2017.  The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 9 October 2014.  **********

		08 February 2012",2012-02-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708632,Evans v R [2012] NSWCCA 59,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The applicant pleaded guilty to two offences being:
Count 1:between 10 June 2010 and 13 June 2010 at Kempsey in the State of NSW did assault Riley Erin Wheeldon and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency on her contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900.
Count 2:on 12 June 2010 at Kemspey in the State of NSW was armed with a weapon, namely a knife with intent to commit an indictable offence namely intimidation contrary to s 114(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900.
2The maximum penalty for the offence the subject of count 1 was 5 years imprisonment and for count 2 was 7 years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced as follows:
Count 1:imprisonment for 8 months to commence on 24 July 2010 and expire on 23 March 2011 with a non-parole period of 6 months to expire on 30 January 2011.
Count 2:imprisonment for 2 years 8 months commencing on 23 November 2010 and expire on 22 July 2013 with a non-parole period of 22 months to expire on 22 September 2012.
3The dates for these sentences were adjusted after the original sentence hearing. At the time that the applicant committed the offences he was on parole which was then revoked. The sentencing judge did not have accurate information as to the expiry date of the previous sentence to which the parole period was relevant when first imposing the present sentences, necessitating a later adjustment.
4The trial judge provided the following account of the relevant facts:
""The circumstances giving rise to the commission of these offences are that the complainant Radi Wheeldon is some eighteen years of age. On the afternoon and evening on 11 June 2010 the complainant was socialising and drinking at home at 15 Kidman Avenue, West Kempsey. Also at the house was Sally Steele and her partner Noah Jones, Timothy Dyksmar and his fiance Katie and Timothy Carroll, the offender and his girlfriend Bethany Robertson. 
At about 11.30pm the complainant went for a drive to pick up her ex-boyfriend Lee Lamoine. She went in the car with Timothy Carroll and Sally Steele who were in the front seats. The complainant and the offender were in the back seats, the complainant was wearing jeans, a black jacket with a hood, black T-shirt and black underpants. On the way to Mr Lamoine's place the accused kept trying to grab the complainant inappropriately, she kept pushing his hand back. At the time this was happening Ms Steele and Mr Carroll were not aware of what the accused was doing.
When they arrived at Mr Lamoine's house both the complainant and the offender knocked on the door. They were told that Mr Lamoine was asleep so they all left to go back home.
The seating arrangements on the return journey were the same, that is the offender and the complainant were sitting in the back seat. On the way back the offender kept trying to grab the complainant, again she kept pushing his hand back. The offender was sitting on the complainant's right side and grabbed her right leg just above the knee with one of his hands. The offender moved his hand all the way to her vagina area, touched her on the vagina on the outside of her clothing, he also tried to put his hands down the front of her jeans. 
The complainant kept pushing the offender's hand away about five times and told him to ""stop it"" and ""no"" each time she pushed his hand away. The offender kept saying ""Baby it's okay,"" every time that the complainant pushed his hand away. At the time that this was happening Ms Steele and Mr Carroll were not aware what the offender was doing as loud music was playing. At this time the offender was kissing the complainant on the neck saying ""It's okay,"" saying this more than once.
When they got close to home the complainant said ""Fuck this,"" and jumped out of the car and started walking down the road as she just wanted to get away. Ms Steele asked the complainant what was wrong, the complainant said ""Nothing, I'm fine, just leave me alone."" The complainant was taken back inside the house. When asked what was wrong the complainant kept saying ""Nothing."" She was crying at this stage.
Mr Timothy Dyksmar asked the complainant what happened and the complainant told him the offender had touched her ""you know where"".
Ms Steele then called for an ambulance. The police and ambulance arrived, the complainant told police he touched me. The complainant was taken to the hospital but she just wanted to go home and sleep so she left and walked home.
Ms Robertson called the offender and told him what the complainant had said. The offender denied anything happened. At some time around 2.30am the offender returned back to the house, he had been given a lift to the next street earlier by Mr Carroll when the ambulance and police arrived.
The offender at this time was really worked up saying ""I'm going to stab this bitch."" Mr Dyksmar went over to the offender and said ""Give me the knife,"" a few times. The offender refused to hand over the knife. The offender walked away and stood on the front lawn. When the complainant arrived home she saw that the offender was there with Ms Steele, Ms Robertson and Mr Dyksmar. When the complainant saw the offender she was so angry she wanted to punch him and as she was about to do this the offender grabbed her shirt around her stomach with his left hand, at the same time the complainant saw his right hand with something shiny in it holding it back and out to the side. 
The offender said to the complainant ""I'm going to stab you, you cunt."" Mr Dyksmar ran in, grabbed the complainant, pulled her away, grabbed the offender's right wrist with his left hand, pushed the offender's arm outwards away from his body. Mr Dyksmar also grabbed the offender by the back of the neck with his right hand. The offender struggled with Mr Dyksmar however he did not let go of the knife, Mr Carroll called triple-0.
The offender pushed the point of the knife against Mr Dyksmar's stomach and said, ""Let me go or I'll stab you and cut your guts out cunt."" Mr Dyksmar pushed the offender's hand and knife away from him, pushed the offender against the fence, the offender released the knife.
The offender settled down and Mr Dyksmar released him. The police arrived, a black plastic handled Wiltshire brand steak knife with a blade about twenty centimetres long was handed to police. The offender was spoken to at the scene, cautioned and arrested and taken to Kempsey Police Station. 
At the police station the offender told police, ""I know I shouldn't have done it. I was going to hurt no-one with it."" He declined to be interviewed and was charged.""
5There was no pre-sentence report before the sentencing judge. However, the applicant's criminal history was provided. It is lengthy and contains various offences of assault, stalking, contravention of domestic violence orders and includes an offence of robbery in company, detaining a person with intent to obtain advantage and the use of a carriage service to threaten to kill persons. It is a very serious record.
6After considering the applicant's criminal history the sentencing judge said, correctly, that it is not a record which would allow the court to extend any leniency whatsoever.
7There are four grounds of appeal. 
Ground 1:The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have any or proper regard to the fact that counts 1 and 2 could have been dealt with in the Local Court and failed to have any proper regard to the maximum penalty in such a case.
8The applicant submitted, correctly, that both of the offences could have been dealt with summarily in the Local Court where a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment could have been imposed. The sentencing judge did not advert to that possibility and it was not raised by either the prosecutor or counsel for the applicant. This is not surprising having regard to the applicant's extensive criminal record and the serious objective criminality, particularly in relation to the second count.
9In Lewis v R [2011] NSWCCA 206 Harrison J (Whealy J A and Latham J agreeing) cited (at [34]-[37]) various statements of principle with respect to this issue, including those by Hall J in Palmer v R [2005] NSWCCA 349; Davies J in Bonwick v R [2010] NSWCCA 177 and Price J in Dagdanasar v R [2010] NSWCCA 310.
10In the last of these cases Price J set out the relevant principles. Dagdanasar had pleaded guilty to a number of offences, including one count of knowingly driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner contrary to s 154(10)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence had a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment if dealt with in the Local Court, and one of 5 years imprisonment if dealt with on indictment. Dagdanasar was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years with an additional term of 18 months. He had a ""lengthy record that included convictions for offences of break enter and steal, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, receiving stolen property and contraventions of apprehended domestic violence orders and has a record for matters dealt with in the Children's Court including offences of stealing a motor vehicle, taking and driving a conveyance and being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner.""
11In the course of his judgment Price J said at [40]:
""It is unsurprising that the sentencing judge did not mention that the offence could have been dealt with summarily. The objective seriousness of the offence, the criminal record of the applicant and the fact that it was committed in breach of parole all called for a sentence in excess of two years. The applicant was not entitled, in my opinion, to any weight being given to the loss of chance of summary disposition.""
12Price J then referred to what Johnson J said in R v EI Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29]:
""It is a well-established sentencing principle that a court dealing on indictment with a matter which was capable of summary disposal may have regard to that fact on sentence: R v Sandford (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 195; R v Griggs (1999) 109 A Crim R 484 at 485-6; Crombie, at paragraph 16; Doan, at 123ff (paragraph 35ff); R v LPY (2002) 135 A Crim R 237 at 240. But it is not a universal rule (Sandford, at 195) nor a factor which operates universally to reduce sentence (Doan, at 124). In some circumstances, the Court may conclude that the offender's criminality was too serious to be dealt with in the Local Court and that the matter was properly before the District Court: R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at paragraph 21. The significance of the loss of a chance to be dealt with in the Local Court will vary from case to case: R v Depoma [2003] NSWCCA 382 at paragraph 13.""
13To my mind, similar observations to those made by Price J are appropriate in the present case and lead inevitably to the conclusion that this ground of appeal must fail.
Ground 2(i):The sentencing judge erred in making a determination as to where in any range of objective seriousness the offending fell in that ... this was a finding the sentencing judge was not required to make.
14It was submitted that his Honour, contrary to authority, carried out a two-stage approach to sentencing the applicant. I reject this submission. A careful reading of his Honour's remarks makes plain that he considered the objective seriousness of each of the offences using terminology appropriate to offences which carry standard non-parole periods. The present offences do not carry standard non-parole periods. However, this is of no moment. A sentencing judge must always consider the criminality involved in the offending and it was for this purpose that the sentencing judge identified the objective seriousness of each offence. However, in so doing his Honour did not engage in a two-stage process of reasoning.
Ground 2(ii):The sentencing judge erred in making a determination as to where in any range of objective seriousness the offending fell in that ... the sentencing judge erred in taking into account the fact the offence was committed whilst on conditional liberty as going to the objective seriousness of the offence.
15Under this ground the applicant submitted that his Honour erred by having regard to the fact that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty when considering the objective seriousness of the offence.
16The relevant passage from his Honour's remarks was:
""These crimes  are prevalent and serious.  Both reflect an attitude towards women and violence and the use of weapons by the offender, however I regard the indecent assault as being well below the middle of any scale constructed for such offences and the charge of being armed to intimidate a little below the middle of such scale. Both offences must result in prison sentences with the aggravating feature to which I have referred.""
17The aggravating feature to which his Honour had previously referred was the fact the offences were committed whilst the applicant was on parole. However, as I understand the passage quoted, his Honour did not include this matter in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. Rather, he included it in his consideration of the appropriate sentence.
18The applicant asserted that his Honour erred in his assessment as to the objective seriousness of the ""armed with intent"" offence. As is often noted by this Court, the characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is a matter for the sentencing judge. It is only if this Court determines that, upon application of the correct principles, error is established that it may intervene: see R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288.
19It was submitted by the applicant that this offence was not objectively serious, since it was to be seen in the context of what had happened, with the applicant being easily overcome by others and ultimately no violence being inflicted.
20It was further submitted that the indictable offence contemplated, being the intention to commit intimidation, seems to have been the least serious of the indictable offences with which an offender can be armed to commit. It was submitted that it was significant that the applicant was armed with a knife and not a firearm, and the objective seriousness of the armed with intent offence was ""a little below the middle [of the range of objective seriousness]."" I am not attracted by this submission. This was a very serious offence. The applicant was carrying a knife and, but for the fact that he was restrained, the situation could have ended up with far more significant consequences. There are many offences which the section contemplates which would be of less serious criminality than the circumstances in which the applicant offended.
21To my mind, none of the matters to which the applicant draws attention establish that his Honour was not entitled to form a view as he did that the objective seriousness of the armed with intent offences was ""a little below the middle [of the range of objective seriousness]."" Indeed, in my opinion, given the state of fear induced by the applicant's actions, his Honour was, if anything, favourable to the applicant.
Ground 3:The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the structuring of the sentences for the individual offences in that there was an inappropriate accumulation of the sentences imposed which led to a combined sentence that overstated the total criminality of the offending.
22In support of this ground the applicant submitted that his Honour did not fix the sentences in accordance with the principles provided in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. I reject that submission. The sentencing judge provided the sentence which he believed to be appropriate for each offence and then considered questions of accumulation or concurrence as well as questions of totality. Although he did not expressly refer to Pearce it was plain he carried out the sentencing task as the High Court requires. The extent to which the sentencing judge accumulated the individual sentences does not reveal error and was entirely appropriate.
Ground 4:The individual sentence imposed on count 2 was manifestly excessive and the overall sentence was manifestly excessive.
23In support of this ground the applicant referred to the sentencing statistics of the Judicial Commission and submitted that they reveal that in some 754 cases only 33 percent of offenders were given fulltime custodial sentences and 82 percent of those were jailed. The statistics reveal that when sentencing in the higher courts, a sentence of fulltime imprisonment is imposed in 61 percent of cases with a total term of 30 months or less being imposed in 67 percent of cases. Accordingly, it was submitted that the sentence which his Honour imposed in the present case in relation to count 2 was excessive.
24The appropriate use of the sentencing statistics has been commented upon by this Court in many cases. They provide useful information in respect of the range of sentences which have previously been imposed for a particular offence. However, an individual offender must be sentenced having regard to the particular circumstances of his or her offending and the personal circumstances of the offender.
25In the present case the applicant has a very significant criminal history extending back to when he was 16 years of age when he was sentenced for an offence of custody of a knife. He has numerous prior convictions for offences of violence including assault, intimidation and breach of apprehended violence orders. His record includes an offence of robbery in company.
26The present offences were committed whilst the applicant was on parole, which was an aggravating factor correctly identified by the sentencing judge. Although the trial judge observed that it was likely the applicant had psychiatric or psychological ""short comings"" the applicant did not seek to tender any professional report in relation to his psychological well being.
27To my mind, the applicant's manifest disregard for the constraints which the law imposes on his behaviour towards others justified a significant sentence in the present case. Without evidence which suggested any mitigating circumstances in the applicant's personality or other personal circumstances, the sentence which his Honour imposed was entirely appropriate.
28In my view the application is entirely without merit. I would refuse leave to appeal. 
29JOHNSON J  I am of the view that these were serious offences committed by the applicant. The applicant was on parole at the time of the commission of the offences. The offence under s 114(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 involved the placing of people in significant fear by his actions.
30In my view the grounds of appeal are unmeritorious and the appropriate order is that leave to appeal against sentence ought to be refused.
31ROTHMAN J:  I agree with the Chief Judge at Common Law.
32McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The orders of the court are as indicated.

1HIS HONOUR: Lui Ena today appears for sentence in relation to an offence committed by him on 14 March 2010 at Leichhardt. The offence to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court and again at this court last Thursday was one alleging that he on 14 March 2010 at Leichhardt did manufacture a prohibited drug to wit pseudoephedrine and expose a child to that manufacturing process or to substances being stored for use in that process. This is an offence contrary to s 24A Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985. 

2It carries a maximum penalty of eighteen years to be distinguished from an offence of manufacture prohibited drug simpliciter which carries a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment. There is additional and/or alternative penalty of 2,400 penalty units available under the Act. I propose to impose a term of imprisonment as was understood in the proceedings last week. I have not been asked to impose a fine. There is no standard nonparole period for this offence. 

3The offender was born on 1 July 1971 and thus at the time of the commission of the offence on my calculation was thirtynine years of age. Some of the material tendered on behalf of the offender provides some background to the circumstances to the commission of the offence and I have taken that into account. In the context of dealing with the factual matters that arise in this case I propose to summarise the facts on sentence that were tendered by agreement by reference also to some of the material that touches upon the offender's subjective circumstances. 

4The offender was a man who developed drug and alcohol dependency problems in the years leading up to the commission of the offence. I accept that at the time of the commission of the offence the offender was indebted to a person or persons who were supplying him with prohibited drugs upon which he was reliant or dependant and I accept that to some extent his judgment was affected by his dependency upon drugs and the need to assuage the debts that he had accrued in relation to his drug usage. 

5This matter arose for the attention of the authorities and now this Court when at about 1.30am on 14 March 2010 there was a large explosion in premises at 12 Hawthorne Street, Leichhardt. When fire officers arrived they found the upstairs section of Unit 1, 12 Hawthorne Street to be alight and there was significant damage to the structure of those premises. These premises were rented by the offender and had been rented by him for approximately five or six months before. He was planning to vacate two or three days after the explosion occurred. 

6It is of some importance to note that the premises had been occupied by the offender as his residence and I accept that he was, for reasons unconnected to the circumstances of the explosion, planning to move to other premises at which he already had personal property. I accept, as it is relevant again to an assessment of the offender's role in this matter, that the offender had leased the premises at Hawthorne Street, Leichhardt in his own name. His connection with the premises could easily have been established. 

7The force of the explosion was so great that it destroyed a double-brick wall at the front of the building and tore portions of the metal roof off their joists throwing them approximately fifty metres from the site of the explosion. A portion of the roof was found on the front of the fence to number 10 Hawthorne Street, the adjoining property, and another portion of the roof was located in the side yard of number 14 Hawthorne Street. There was extensive damage to the interior of the unit and I have available to me a series of photographs which are taken, as I understand it, as stills from a video recording showing the extent of the damage. 

8I have not been favoured with details of the cost of the damage to either the owner of the premises at 1/12 Hawthorne Street or the owner's insurer nor am I given details as to the loss to the relevant owner and/or insurer of Unit 2, 12 Hawthorne Street, Leichhardt.

9The charge to which the offender has pleaded guilty - pleads the aggravation ,which increases the otherwise appropriate maximum penalty, of exposing a child to the process of manufacture. The child exposed was a fouryearold girl called Sophia. She lived with her mother Rachel. Just by a stroke of luck when the explosion occurred the child was sleeping in her mother's bed. The mother saw a bright light and heard crashing noises. There was a large amount of dust in her bedroom. She grabbed the child to run downstairs. She heard someone bashing on the door yelling out the words, ""Get out of the house now."" I am satisfied that person was the offender although he himself was badly injured. I believe it is a significant matter to the offender's credit and supports his credibility in terms of his account of what occurred inside his own unit, that the offender notwithstanding his extensive injuries took the time before he fled to alert the people next door to a danger that they obviously already were aware of because of the extent of the explosion.

10It is worth pointing out however that the debris from the destroyed brickwork caused by the explosion was strewn across the child's bed,. The damage to 2/12 Hawthorne Street appears to be confined to the child's room; the upstairs bathroom and the stairwell and some evidence of that damage is available. It is quite clear from the evidence contained within the facts that the offender was aware of the fact that a child lived in the premises next door. The statement of facts refers to the offender being regularly seen by the occupants next door and the fact that on 13 March the day before the explosion the mother and the child were playing in the side garden and the offender was seen to come and go from the premises. It is just a complete fluke, to use a colloquialism, that the child was not injured. Thankfully for the offender and for the community and the child.

11So far as the manufacturing of the prohibited drug, adverting in part to the evidence of the offender and also the facts that have been presented to me, I am satisfied that the offender was approached by a person to make his residence available for the manufacture of at least pseudoephedrine. It has to be fairly said that the Court was not impressed by the offender's unwillingness to name the person who approached him. The matter was never addressed and I sought not to make an issue of it, but the facts of the matter are I could compel the offender to tell me the name of that person, otherwise the offender could face severe penalty for contempt of court or other sanction. 

12In any event I accept on face value that the offender declined to nominate to police and to this court the person who recruited him who was clearly the person who was the principal in this process of manufacture. The offender has told me that there were threats made against him and he was in fear of those threats. He gave evidence that in fact he left hospital prematurely because of those threats. Of course, I have got no way of knowing one way or the other whether in fact threats have been made to him, other than on the say so of the offender. I can understand that it is likely that another person who was responsible for this laboratory would be very anxious to not be named. And I can understand the offender is in a vulnerable position in many respects. However, as I said, it was still open to the offender to supply that information.

13When the relevant authorities searched the premises it was quite clear that the premises were being used as a laboratory. Having regard to the state of the offender's evidence and the very skilled crossexamination of the Crown Prosecutor and matters raised by the Crown Prosecutor with me, she having sought instructions from a chemist Peter Ballard about some aspects of the offender's evidence, I do not have reason to doubt the evidence of the offender that the process of manufacture really commenced two days before the explosion, that is on 12 March when the offender began moving material from his then residence to which he was to move at Rosebery Place, Balmain to the premises he was vacating. 

14I also accept, because I have no reason to doubt what has been asserted, that the actual cooking process which was involved with the production of pseudoephedrine was a process commenced sometime in the afternoon or evening of 13 March. I accept that the case is concerned with one process of manufacturing and there is no evidence available to me to reasonably conclude that the explosion came at the end of a series of processes of manufacturing over a number of days.

15I am not assisted with evidence as to the time it would take to extract pseudoephedrine to the extent that it may have been extracted at the time of the explosion. But from what I understood of the evidence of the offender there were a series of cooks occurring, if I could use that expression, from batches of tablets containing pseudoephedrine and other drugs. 

16When police conducted their investigations they found a large silver chrome-coloured dish with bright red orange-coloured residue on the ground on the eastern side of number 14 Hawthorne Street. A scraping of that residue was taken and it was analysed as containing 54.8 per cent pseudoephedrine. Within the townhouse occupied by the offender or used by the offender were a number of items including containers, buckets, milkshake makers or blenders, portable washing machines, bags containing paper filters, other plastic drums containing absolute alcohol commonly used in the manufacture of pseudoephedrine, a glove and other items consistent with the process of manufacturing rudely interrupted by the explosion. 

17Within the kitchen of the townhouse there were other items found consistent with the manufacture of pseudoephedrine, a white dish containing a plastic container with orange residue, a fan with green residue from which a scraping was taken and found to contain sixtyfive per cent pseudoephedrine. A frying pan cord also with green residue which scraping revealed that it contained 62.1 per cent pseudoephedrine. 

18In the upstairs bathroom were the obvious detritus of the explosion, the cooking process in the chrome pan having occurred or was occurring in the bathroom at the time of the explosion. There were various items including a fan, ducting, Perspex, battery pack, carbon filter, a frying pan that were in various states of melting or damage. In the upstairs bedroom two further twenty litre plastic containers containing a green liquid residue were found. This liquid contained pseudoephedrine. There was also found another exhaust fan, frying pan lids, some other containers, strainers and a funnel consistent with the process of pseudoephedrine manufacture.

19The laundry held a black plastic bag containing two plastic bags of red gluggy powder the total weight of which was seven kilograms. This was considered to be the waste product derived out of the extraction process for pseudoephedrine. This waste material was analysed for the purposes of calculating a weight range in relation to the pseudoephedrine that had been manufactured. It is unclear as to whether this is the only waste product that was produced from the process of manufacture but there is no evidence of any other relevant waste. 

20Mr Ballard's conclusion from his expertise as a chemist was that the pseudoephedrine base extracted from the waste product was estimated to be between seventyfive and 1,038 grams. This is a very wide range of estimation but I am not assisted as to how this came to be of such a character. Chemist Ballard further stated that these quantities of pseudoephedrine could be used to manufacture a maximum of between sixtyseven and 938 grams of methylamphetamine. He said that the actual amount manufactured will be less and would depend upon the skill of the operator, the formation of bi-products and the quality of reagents used. 

21He stated that caffeine and antihistamine such as chlorpheniramine can be found in cold and flu medications that contain pseudoephedrine. They are extracted out of those medications along with the pseudoephedrine and do not interfere with the manufacture of methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine. The presence of these other products to be found in cold and flu medications in the scrapings from the used paper filters and the blender is consistent with pseudoephedrine originating from cold and flu tablets. The offender has confirmed that, because he said in his evidence on two occasions for periods of up to an hour he was involved in grinding or breaking down physically such tablets. I note that no such tablets were found in that form in the detritus of the explosion. Mr Ballard said that these tablets can be crushed with blenders and electric drills as were found in the Hawthorne Street premises. 

22The electric frying pan was consistent with the cooking process. Mr Ballard said that the cooking process involves heating pseudoephedrine mixed to boil off the ethanol as vapour. Ethanol vapour is a highly flammable vapour and when mixed with air in the correct proportions produces an explosive mixture. An ignition source such as a spark from an electric motor or thermostat controller or an electric switch may ignite an explosion. 

23Smears of blood were found, a pair of eye goggles were located on the stairs. The police had no trouble, as I said, locating the offender. Ultimately, on 15 March 2010 the offender attended the police station at Balmain in company with his solicitor. He was severely injured. The ambulance officers described the offender as having ""severe burn injuries to his arms, lower legs, back and some burns to the head area."" The burns were equal to or greater than fifty per cent of his body. These burns were considered life threatening and displayed partial and full thickness burns. It would appear the offender was wearing goggles otherwise he would have lost his eyesight. And goggle marks were visible on his face which was burnt. 

24The offender spent over a month at Concord Hospital receiving treatment and I have medical evidence in the character of discharge summaries and clinical notes confirming his presence in the hospital. Various medications being provided to him. Operations for skin grafts and the like and the fact that he was in persistent pain with severe wounds requiring very intense medical treatment and recommendations that he continue receiving medication to treat infection and to deal with pain which he continues to receive up until the present time. He has considerable scar tissue and I accept that these injuries from which he suffers will be a constant reminder for him of these matters giving rise to the charge for probably the rest of his life and have had a very severe impact on him. His discomfort and pain continues.

25Police were able to execute a search warrant at the premises at Rosebery Place at Balmain and there they found evidence of burnt skin consistent with the offender having been in those premises. They also found two twenty litre drums of the ""Denatured Absolute Alcohol"" identical to those found at the scene of the explosion.

26The offender gave evidence that he had come and gone from the premises whilst the preparation of material and the cooking of material to produce pseudoephedrine was taking place. I have also indicated that he actively participated in the process to a limited degree. He also gave evidence that early in the morning of the 14th when he returned to the premises there was a very strong smell of what was clearly ethanol vapour and other vapours. He went upstairs directly to the bathroom to disconnect the cooking implement. That probably precipitated the explosion. I accept the offender was in fact taking active steps to minimise the risk having arrived at the premises, and with his knowledge of the building industry and the like fully realising the risk of danger from material of this nature. There is no evidence upon which I could conclude that the offender had any knowledge of the process of the manufacture of pseudoephedrine, but his counsel conceded, and I accept, that the offender was clearly reckless to the risks that were involved and his plea of guilty is at least an acknowledgment of that.

27The facts are very serious in a number of respects. Clearly the process of manufacture was designed to obtain a quantity of pseudoephedrine and possibly or probably methylamphetamine in due course from the pseudoephedrine which was substantial and would have been available for distribution for commercial purposes, whether ultimately sold as methylamphetamine or sold as pseudoephedrine to others for whatever purposes they use it. Pseudoephedrine is a prohibited drug, as with methylamphetamine. 

28Of course the facts do not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the process at the house was the process of manufacturing methylamphetamine as such. Clearly the plea of guilty and the facts are concerned only with the manufacture of pseudoephedrine, but as I said the facts themselves without objection point to the fact that pseudoephedrine may be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. One could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the exact amount of pseudoephedrine that was manufactured in the process beyond noting the very wide range of excess by Chemist Ballard. This was consistent with a ""commercial"" - in the general sense of the word - operation and nothing was put to me to suggest to the contrary. Certainly no suggestion was made that the accused was involved in this process to obtain pseudoephedrine for his personal use or the personal use of the man who was the principal of the manufacturing process.

29The offender's criminal history is not significant. He has some minor driving matters and other offences through the eighties and nineties. The one in the Children's Court of course I ignore. He has one conviction for driving with a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood stream, for which he was fined a modest amount and disqualified for twelve months in 2003. He has a conviction for driving with a middle range prescribed concentration of alcohol in 2007, for which he received a good behaviour bond and a period of disqualification. Those offences confirm what appears from the subjective material that the offender for a period of time had had problems with alcohol abuse and that ultimately led to his abuse of drugs.

30With regard to his background he has had a disadvantaged background.

31He had little contact - in fact from what I understood of it no contact -with his father. He was raised with his mother and other siblings. He left school with sufficient qualifications to become a panel beater. He was unfairly and to some extent cruelly treated by a stepfather at one stage. He began using prohibited drugs at an early age and he had a number of emotional upsets. He had a partner who gave birth to a daughter who is now nineteen years of age, and as I understood the evidence, although there seems to be some conflict in the evidence about this, she has two children, having first become pregnant at fifteen. I accept the offender has been emotionally distressed prior to the commission of the offence by the fact that his daughter had become pregnant at such a young age and was deeply concerned about her welfare.

32So far as his employment is concerned, as I said he qualified as a panel beater, worked in the auto industry for some period of time. There is reference in some of the material to helping his mother in a café, although he did not give oral evidence of that as far as I am aware. Again I do not have a transcript of the proceedings on the last occasion. He did however move into the construction industry and worked in that industry for approximately seven or eight years rising to the rank of a supervisor. He was involved in project management and had many responsibilities in that industry, but those responsibilities were one of the factors that contributed to drug usage to relieve tension. He set up a business selling online safety gear in the construction industry and other material including promotional products. He had a number of setbacks in relation to that business prior to the commission of the offence. This again contributed to his decision to use prohibited drugs and he was in some financial difficulty at the relevant time that the offence was committed. 

33As I have earlier indicated, he gave evidence, which I accept, that he purchased drugs on credit and it was through the fact that he owed money to people or a person for the drugs he used that he agreed to allow the process of manufacture to be undertaken in his premises. Of course, this does not relieve the offender from the finding that an aggravating factor in this matter is that he was involved in the commission of the offence for financial reward, even if it was to pay off existing debts. There was a financial advantage for the offender from his involvement.

34I accept that since August 2011 up until going into custody last week the offender has sought assistance from a psychologist to resolve many of the issues that have contributed to his offending - his drug and alcohol dependency, his relationship with his partners, his relationship with his daughter and her children and also dealing with other matters including his fears of retribution from those that are responsible primarily for the manufacture of the pseudoephedrine.

35Dr Milic undertook standard psychometric assessment and his findings were that the offender was an individual who tended to rely on others for support and security to a strong extent. He has severe trauma related anxiety symptoms which are consistent with the experience of the explosion, general anxiety symptoms and alcohol dependence. He is likely to have chronic problems with bodily tension, nausea, worry, intrusive memories of traumatic events and a tendency to avoid difficult situations. 

36The psychologist was of the view on the basis of the testing, as he understood it, that alcohol dependence and drug dependence existed before the explosion. The prisoner's main problems at the time of treatment were worries about his sentence, the welfare of his daughter, his physical injuries which are significant and related matters. The psychologist thought that the offender's account was plausible. 

37He had a disadvantaged background which had impacted upon his early life and that he had severe emotional distress from his daughter's pregnancies, feeling that her mother had let her down and that he may have let her down given his separation from her. Part of his problems arose too from neglecting his business because of his dependency on alcohol and drugs and that all in all as he comes for sentencing various traumatic events including the explosion have taken a heavy toll on his emotional and physical health. 

38I have a number of references from friends of the offender. These references cover a range of matters including the positive aspects of the offender's character, expressions of remorse and regret for his involvement in this matter, the offender's affection for his child and her children, the effect upon him of his injuries, his industry and his support for his friends' children. One of the matters adverted to was an act of bravery in assisting a friend's daughter from injury when she ran onto the road. These are all matters which reflect upon the offender as a person who, generally speaking, is a man who has made a worthwhile contribution to his community and he is possessed of qualities that may be taken into account in mitigation. 

39I accept that from time to time he has been hard working. He is honest in his dealings. He is well respected by his friends as being a person who is loyal and committed to others and, further, that he is endeavouring to take steps to rehabilitate himself and to improve his life.

40I have evidence from the offender's business adviser that the offender's business affairs are in order, and I accept that the offender in recent times has taken steps to revive his business. The chartered accountant who prepared the report noted that whilst he had some problems with failing to lodge a tax claim for a few years, he did so because he was generating income which is consistent with the offender being in financial difficulty prior to the commission of the offence. The business however is one that has been revived. The customer base has been growing since August 2011 and the business is paying its way. The offender I understood has support in the ongoing conduct of the business into the future whilst he remained in custody, as he would have expected to do so after he appeared at this court. He has no outstanding debt, the company has no outstanding debt, and the financial records and the ATO tax lodgements for the business, which is called Stay Safe Warehouse Pty Limited, are up-to-date.

41I have taken into account all the material that has been tendered adverting to the offender's subjective circumstances. Included in that material of course is a letter addressed to myself consistent with the evidence given by the offender that he expresses guilt and shame for his conduct. He expresses regret for his conduct and is constantly reminded of his foolishness by the injury that he has done to himself. 

42He is deeply apologetic for the recklessness of his conduct as it may have threatened the occupants in the premises next door and nearby, that he has nightmares about what has happened, that he needs to get on with his life, but at the moment he cannot see an ending to his suffering given the character of his scarring and his pain, that he has sought help from a psychologist and attended recovery groups to address his drinking problem. He also wishes to continue to support his daughter and her children, and I accept what he has put in that statement. I also have, as I said, discharge summaries and details of the medication and treatment that he has received. I have made earlier findings about the seriousness of his injuries.

43I have a Probation and Parole Service report setting out his background. I need not dwell upon that. It reflects upon his employment and education history, his work in project management and his business. It also reflects upon his drug and alcohol abuse since an early age and the fact that he has been seeking treatment. The Probation and Parole Service officer reported the offender had expressed ""particular remorse for the impact of the explosion on the child who lived next door."" It noted his explanation for his involvement in the offence which I accept. 

44Its summary was that the offender presented as a ""solitary person"" who was trying to make a success of his life but was labouring under the difficulty of emotional and financial instability. The Probation and Parole officer said he was frank during interview, he was open in admitting his own failings and shortcomings and that the psychologist's assessments and treatments had had a positive effect upon him and that they would help him in the future, that he would benefit from a low to medium level of intervention by the service. He is unsuitable for community service and clearly given the seriousness of the offence, he is not eligible for consideration for another alternative to full-time custody such as an intensive correction order because the appropriate sentence must be greater than two years.

45If I have not already mentioned it, although it was discussed at the beginning of my remarks today, it has been confirmed that the offender was committed for sentence after undertaking Criminal Case Conferencing. I have a relevant certificate in that regard and I therefore am prepared to grant the offender a discount of twenty-five per cent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to represent the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty in accordance with the terms of s 16 and 17 Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 and/or the terms of R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment from 1999 dealing with that particular discount where those two sources of power are not inconsistent. No issue of inconsistency arises in this matter.

46With regard to the submissions, it was conceded by his counsel that this was a very serious matter, and I accept the submission that he was not to be sentenced on the basis that he was the principal mover of the operation, and I have already noted a number of matters that flowed from the evidence and submissions in my earlier findings of fact. 

47The learned Crown Prosecutor put, very skilfully, that this was a matter involving considerable damage and given the maximum penalty and the character of the charge, it is a matter where a term of imprisonment must be imposed. I will come back to some of the submissions put by the parties about s 21A matters when I deal with that provision.

48Reference was made in the submissions to the decision of Alameddine v R [2006] NSWCCA 317. Mr Alameddine was convicted of an offence committed in 2002 carrying a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment. 

49There the offender was on home detention and he permitted another person to conduct an amphetamine laboratory in a shed at the rear of his premises. 

50The substances identified from the explosion that occurred at the shed injuring the offender, similarly to this offender being injured, included 125.8 grams of pseudoephedrine of almost sixty per cent purity and almost thirty grams of methylamphetamine of very low purity with a very large quantity of waste product of sludge capable of producing 4,540 tablets from the dried waste. 

51That offender was on home detention for driving offences relating to drug use. The offender was sentenced on the basis of a limited role, not for participating at all in the process as I understand it but for permitting premises owned by him to be used for the manufacture of drugs. I accept that he was on conditional liberty at the time, bearing in mind he was serving home detention. The gravamen of the judgment, however, is not the parity of sentencing issue or the comparative sentencing issue, although it is a matter that provides some assistance in that regard, but rather the question of ""extra-curial punishment"". The Court referred with approval to the decision of R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561, R v Dietz (2003) 139 A Crim R 398, R v Noble a Queensland decision from 1996 and a Victorian decision of R v Barci (1994) 76 A Crim R 103. 

52In the latter case the Victorian Full Court noted that it was ""not a complete answer to say that the offender brought his injuries upon himself (in response to a Crown submissions on appeal), these very serious injuries directly resulted from the commission of the crime (and) for the rest of his life those injuries will serve as a savage reminder to (him) of his criminality and as such they must fairly be regarded as constituting some punishment for the criminality."" Such a finding is available here. In Alameddine the court agreed with the judge who sentenced the appellant that the injuries were an available factor to be weighed in favour of the appellant in sentence assessment along the lines contemplated in Barci, although the issue was not whether the judge took the matters into account at all but what weight should he gave to them. The Court referred to the decision of Sharpe where it was accepted, although the injuries were passing injuries, that in a case where the injury was a consequence of the crime the principle did not operate to prevent mitigation on account of extracurial punishment in such circumstances. The Court rejected a submission there was ""a boundary"" in relation to injuries sustained by self inflicted illegal activity beyond which no mitigation could be granted. The Court in Alameddine noted however that that was not to say that the circumstances of infliction were irrelevant, and I adopt what was said in Alameddine. I indicate, as I have said, that the effect of the injuries on the offender will be a savage reminder of his criminality and is a matter available in mitigation, which I have taken into account as required by the High Court judgment in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048. 

53I am sorry, Mr Ena, I am very close to finishing your matter but you know the sentence and you know most of the reasons, I am going to interrupt my remarks as I am required to take a verdict in a trial I am conducting, and ask you if you don't mind waiting in the room behind the door there. I will have you back here in five or ten or fifteen minutes, I do not know how long. I will interrupt my remarks and I will come back to you. I apologise for not completing my remarks.

54I resume my remarks on sentence in the matter of Mr Ena. When I took the verdict of the jury in the trial that I had been conducting I was referring to the decision of Alameddine and principles contained within that judgment relating to ""extra curial punishment"". I wish to just add one matter about Alameddine. It was not specifically referred to as necessarily a comparative case for sentencing purposes. There are, of course, in the objective case many similarities although the quantities of drug potentially created do vary between each case. 

55The role of Mr Alameddine clearly was less than the accused's because, as I said, the facts in that matter as I understood them did not show the same extent of active participation in the process but there was the quality also of permitting another person to conduct the process of manufacture. Both men suffered very serious injuries and properly they are taken into account here as with Mr Alameddine. 

56One matter, apart from the fact that Mr Alameddine was subject to conditional liberty, a matter that is not an aggravation here, which does separate the two offenders, is that Mr Alameddine was convicted of an offence carrying a lesser maximum penalty. The Crown very helpfully provided information to show that the offence with which I am now concerned was approved by Parliament subsequent to the commission of the Alameddine offence and the Parliament has expressed a greater maximum penalty for the exposure of a child to risk. 

57Whilst there was a risk to others in the Alameddine case there was no particular risk pleaded and certainly the blowing up of the shed is a different situation than blowing up a townhouse adjacent to and with a common wall to another building in which other people are present, in circumstances where this offender clearly must have expected, at the very least if he did not actually know, would have contained his neighbours at that hour of the day, being the early hours of the morning. 

58Not for a moment am I suggesting that the offender intended that anyone be hurt or that there be an explosion. It was conceded, as I said earlier, that Mr Ena was reckless to the risks. He tried to militate or reduce, or remove the risks, ironically his actions in that regard may well have contributed to the explosion, but a plea of guilty acknowledges an exposure of the child to the risks in question, and that is a matter of importance when considering Alameddine by comparison to this matter here.

59With regard to the offender's circumstances, I note his injuries will cause him hardships in custody. I have sought with my best endeavours to obtain a report in that regard. As I have indicated, the matter will be delayed a further five or six weeks if such a report is to be prepared. I was told it could not be prepared in the time that I sought, that was six days. No further report is sought and it is asked that I continue with the sentencing today, by both parties, although it is really a matter for the offender as to whether that would occur. 

60I would have granted an adjournment had an adjournment been sought, but it is quite clear, given particularly what I have been told about the confusion and the lack of knowledge of the precise circumstances of the offender when he came into custody, that the offender's circumstances in custody will be such as to create a greater hardship than for the ordinary offender. He will have to have treatment for his injuries throughout the term of imprisonment. He may need to be isolated from other prisoners for that treatment to be obtained. Because he is physically injured he is, to some extent, disabled or incapacitated and if a threat of physical violence arose I would expect that he would be far more vulnerable than he would have been but for the injuries. 

61Of course, the precise circumstances of his custody in the future are matters of prediction about which I cannot be certain. I am mindful of the lack of available evidence as to his treatment whilst in custody. As I have said, the hardships in custody I believe can be generally assessed at this point, and as I have said, no attempt has been made to require me to find or obtain further information to be more specific. It is a matter to be taken into account in mitigation of what is otherwise a serious offence.

62I have had regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the multitudinal purposes of sentence therein contained and note the obiter observations of the full Bench of the High Court in Veen (No 2) v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 465 that the purposes of sentencing are like signposts, sometimes pointing in opposing directions. 

63I appreciate that this crime, given the offender's subjective circumstances, require a balancing of personal and general deterrence, a need for punishment and denunciation, making the offender accountable ameliorated by the desire to promote his rehabilitation and also to give proper recognition to matters in mitigation and matters even on the objective factors in his favour, such as his alerting the neighbours to the risks or continuing risks, despite the very severe injuries he suffered himself.

64With regard to s 21A matters, as I said, these were the subject of specific submission. The principal aggravating factors arising under s 21A(2) noting the matters already incorporated into my reasoning by operation of s 21A(1) of the Act are the fact that the offender committed this offence for financial reward and the damage and/or loss to the owner of the property that he rented and the owners and occupants of the property next door, was substantial. 

65I have not been favoured with precise evidence of the extent of damage - perhaps I should have been - but ultimately I can see that the damage was substantial and no submission was put to the contrary. The facts make that clear. There was a degree of planning in the commission of the offence, but that is not a specific aggravating factor under 21A(2) of the Act, because the planning in such an offence is really integral to the offence, as was pleaded, as would financial reward to some extent. I accept that this offence was not a part of a series of criminal acts.

66One sticking point I guess between the parties, if I might dwell upon this matter just briefly, was the Crown's submission that I should find as an aggravating factor there was a grave risk of death to another. Of course, the Crown pleads and the maximum penalty reflects the fact that there is the aggravation of exposing a child to risk, that is a very serious matter given the facts of this case. 

67However, I cannot conclude that there was a grave risk of death to another in the circumstances of the matter. True it is if the child had been in her own bedroom she may have been killed and the offender would be facing a far more serious charge. But, whilst it is clear that there was a risk of potential harm and even physical injury to others, the particular aggravation particularised in s 21A speaks of a ""grave risk of death"". There may have been a risk of death, but not a ""grave risk of death"" in all the circumstances. In any event I think that the issue that the Crown is raising is adequately addressed in the way the case is pleaded.

68With regard to matters arising under s 21(3) of the Act, relevantly in addition to the matters I have already identified, the offender does not have a significant record of criminal convictions. I am prepared to accept that he is unlikely to reoffend. I accept that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. I accept that he has expressed contrition as required under the subsection and it is a genuine contrition. Of course there is also the plea of guilty, however, the offender receives a discrete discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea in any event.

69I have made a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In my view there are a number of features that are matters that properly permit an adjustment of the non-parole period in accordance with the terms of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to reflect special circumstances. Those special circumstances in my view are as follows, but not in any particular order. Firstly, the offender will need an extended period of parole supervision to adjust to community life having served his first term of imprisonment and will need an extended period of supervision by the parole service, particularly in relation to drug and alcohol and other psychological counselling. 

70I further note in relation to the imprisonment of the offender he will need assistance to adjust given what I understand to be the difficulties he will face in custody arising out of his injuries. The offender has not served a term of imprisonment before, in fact he has only ever been on one bond before and it is clear that he observed the conditions of that bond. In the circumstances of the matter I have therefore concluded that the non-parole period should be adjusted as against the totality of the sentence to reflect the special circumstances I have outlined.
 
71Assuming that I have covered all relevant matters raised by the parties -directly I certainly have addressed in my formulation of the appropriate sentence all matters that have been brought to my attention by the parties.
 
72You can stand up thank you Mr Ena. In relation to the offence for which you have been found guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of one year and eight months. That will commence from the date you came into custody, 2 February 2012, expiring 1 October 2013. The balance of the sentence will be one year and ten months expiring on 1 August 2015. I cannot direct that you be released to parole at the end of the non-parole period. If you are of good behaviour and you have favourable reports from the Probation and Parole Service I am sure that you will be so released, but the reality is, as you well understand, this is a serious matter and it is inevitable notwithstanding the terms of s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that a term of full time imprisonment must be imposed.

73I trust that you get proper treatment and I ask that the orders I make contain a further recommendation that the offender be properly assessed and properly treated whilst in custody in respect of his medical conditions. And I again recommend that he be returned, at this point, to the Justice Health facility at the appropriate institution firstly for assessment for classification,

74ABBOTT: Thank you your Honour.

		18 September 2012",2012-02-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708640,R v Abdul ZAHED [2012] NSWDC 151,"Sentence


1HIS HONOUR: Abdul Zahed appears today for sentence in relation to three matters, but one indictable matter. The indictable matter to which he admits his guilt is related to an offence contrary to s 7(1) Firearms Act 1996. The offence alleges that he possessed an unauthorised prohibited firearm at Rosebery on 14 September 2011, to wit, a prohibited pistol which was a nine millimetre Glock pistol not being authorised to possess the firearm by licence or permit. The words I have used have slightly paraphrased the charge. This offence, contrary to that provision, carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. It has a standard non-parole period of three years imprisonment.

2There are two related matters which are requiring attention in these sentencing proceedings and to which the offender has pleaded guilty. One is a charge of possessing ammunition without authority, contrary to s 65(3) Firearms Act 1996. I am told the maximum penalty for that offence is fifty penalty units or $5,500. That allegation relates to a couple of live cartridges found in the prisoner's pocket at the time of his arrest. 

3The second charge is a charge of goods in custody suspected of being unlawfully obtained, being a sum of $1,640 again found in the prisoner's possession on his arrest, contrary to s 527C Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is six months imprisonment or a fine of five penalty units and $550. I do not propose to add to the sentence for the principal offence in imposing penalties. One of those matters would only attract a fine in any event. I will deal with those matters in due course. The facts reveal the relationship of those matters to the more serious principal offence.

4It is important, however, to step back a bit from the facts just for the moment to put the matters that I am concerned with in some context. The prisoner, at the time of the commission of the offences with which I am concerned, was on parole. I will deal with his criminal history in some little detail later but his criminal history reveals that in 2004 and 2005 and then in 2008 (while serving, as I understand it, the penalties imposed in 2005), the prisoner received a number of significant gaol sentences for serious offences, including offences of robbery, detaining a person for advantage and the like. He was released to parole, as I understand the matter, on 21 August 2009. He was arrested on 20 October 2009 in relation to an offence with another person or other persons and I accept, as was revealed in the custody record, that he was released from custody again on 8 September 2010. The matter that brought him back into custody in October 2009 whilst on parole was not a breach of his parole but his charging with a fresh matter which was ultimately withdrawn. So the prisoner spent approximately ten and a half months in custody in relation to a matter for which he was not subsequently convicted. He was released to parole, as I see it, in 2010 but unfortunately quickly breached his parole. I have the revocation papers in relation to that breach. The breach constituted a positive sample of morphine in a urine analysis obtained 2 November 2010. In a private meeting on 11 November 2010 the Parole authority revoked the parole of the prisoner. The condition of his parole that he breached was not to use, or be in possession of, a prohibited drug or substance. The revocation was backdated. The prisoner himself concedes that at this stage he went on ""the run"" and was on the run up until the day of his arrest in relation to the current matters. 

5The current matters arise from the fact that the police became aware of the prisoner's whereabouts and armed with an outstanding warrant they arrested him outside a home unit in Gardeners Road, Rosebery. As police were approaching the premises where the prisoner currently then was residing, two people came out of the unit followed by the prisoner who was recognised. Although it is not revealed in the agreed facts, in the history given by the prisoner, there was something of a struggle. The prisoner claims that he suffered an injury to his nose and an injury to his rib in that struggle. Ultimately, when searched he was asked if he had anything illegal in his possession and he identified the fact that he had a Glock firearm in his bum bag saying, ""It's a nine mil"". Police removed a firearm which was a nine millimetre Glock pistol or handgun, black in colour with the serial number removed. The firearm was loaded with eight rounds in the magazine. I am not given any evidence as to how many rounds the magazine could hold. The prisoner did say to the police ""It's mine, I wouldn't use it."" He gave no other account of himself. He has never explained from whom he obtained the firearm, although he has given explanations in a hearsay form in this court to the psychologist and the psychiatrist about the circumstances as to why he armed himself.

6The nine millimetre Glock is a semi automatic pistol, which means that it is capable of firing multiple bullets at a rapid rate. As I understand it that model of firearm, or a very similar model of firearm, is the handgun issued to New South Wales police officers. 

7As I mentioned there were two further cartridges, live ammunition for that firearm in his pocket, giving rise to one of the related charges as well as the cash. The prisoner said that the cash was his and told the police he was unemployed. He declined to give an explanation as to how he came into possession of the cash. He also had in his possession three mobile phones.

8The Crown concedes, and the facts reveal, the prisoner pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. The prisoner will receive a twentyfive per cent discount upon the otherwise appropriate penalty for the principal offence to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. I propose to give a similar discount for the goods in custody matter, albeit that any sentence I impose for that would not add to the time the prisoner is to be in custody.

9The prisoner committed this offence whilst on parole and at a time when his parole was revoked. I note that the prisoner's parole had been revoked for reasons other than the current charge. The current charge would inevitably have led to the revocation of his parole.

10The prisoner's birth date, as I understand it, is 13 November 1984. That means he appears before me today at the age of twentyseven and was, as I understand it, twentysix at the time of the commission of the offence. He has a lengthy record, although I do not place any weight on his convictions or findings of guilt in the Children's Court. The first entry in the Children's Court is an offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon for which he was charged in April 1999 when he would have been, on my calculation, fourteen years of age. Ignoring the other matters in the Children's Court but noting a number of appearances the prisoner first appeared in an adult court, as best I can calculate it, at the Parramatta District Court in March 2004, for an offence committed on 10 April 2002. He was convicted, according to the computer printout, of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. He was sentenced to eighteen months with a non-parole period of nine months. That sentence commencing on 12 November 2003 and another offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm were taken into account.

11He then had some driving matters, two of which involved terms of imprisonment. Then on 13 December 2005 for offences for which he was charged, as I understand, on 12 November 2003, he was convicted of a series of offences. They included aggravated robbery, robbery in company, demand property in company with menaces, taking and detaining a person in company with intent to obtain advantage, taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner and robbery with an offensive weapon. 

12The criminal history suggests, although have not married it with the precise terms of his Honour Judge Viney's orders which I have seen, that he received various sentences between eighteen months imprisonment and six years imprisonment with a three year nonparole period. He received the sentence of six years with a three year non-parole period for the offence of robbery in company. The other robbery offences attracted sentences of five years with a three year non-parole period. He subsequently then appeared in the Campbelltown District Court in relation to an offence for which he was charged on 16 November 2007 of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a felony with a dangerous weapon for which he was sentenced to four years and three months imprisonment commencing on 11 August 2008 with a non-parole period of twelve months. It would seem that sentence was fixed to be partially cumulative upon the sentences that had been imposed by his Honour Judge Viney. 

13Despite some question mark as to when that last offence was actually committed, one can see that the prisoner was in 2005 sentenced to significant terms of imprisonment in respect of offences for which he was charged in November 2003, when he would have been something in the order of eighteen or nineteen years of age. He thus spent a period of time in custody until released to parole to have one month in the community, then to be taken back into custody for ten months or so for a crime he did not commit and then to eventually be released to parole, which he breached two months later.

14I deal with these matters in some detail simply to underline the fact that the prisoner has not had a great a deal of opportunity to prove himself on parole. His failure to initially comply with his parole conditions, which gave rise to the initial revocation to which I earlier referred, might be better understood in the context of the history that I have given and the difficulties the prisoner has had in adjusting to community living, some of which are not of his making.

15In relation to the Probation and Parole Service report that I have been provided, it sets out some detail of his background picked up in the two reports. It notes the fact that the prisoner was born of parents born or from Lebanon and were traditional people, but he suffered some hardships including an alleged act of sexual abuse at the hands of a relative and some brutal or heavy handed treatment by his father and elder siblings. 

16The Probation and Parole Service notes however, as might be self evident from the record that I have referred to, that he was involved with a ""negative peer group engaging in violent acts towards members of the wider community"". To that end I have read the detail of the facts provided in the judgment of his Honour Judge Viney on 13 December 2005. I should point out the detail his Honour provides is only the barest summary. His Honour in fact in traversing a number of offences set out in the criminal history points out that the statement of agreed facts ran to eleven or so pages and he treats those facts in a page and a half. He did make the observation that there were several episodes of violence or threatened violence to innocent victims, the theft of the properties. Some of the offences involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon and the offences were clearly planned criminal activity. The prisoner apparently was on bail for offences at the time and according to the judgment of his Honour was in fact on parole as well in relation to another sentence.

17The Probation and Parole Service report notes another matter which I accept is a fact. That is before the prisoner was re-released from custody, having been in custody ten and a half months on a charge for which he was never convicted, the prisoner's brotherinlaw was apparently murdered in a park in Greenacre or thereabouts. The prisoner was released from custody and claims to have taken on some responsibility to protect his late brotherinlaw's wife, his sister, and also claims that he was very vigilant to protect himself. In fact the prisoner's explanation for the possession of the firearm is that he obtained the firearm for the purposes of protection of himself and his family. He also states to the Probation and Parole Service that on release to the community with these pressures upon him he resorted back to the use of illicit substances and became paranoid about matters of personal safety.

18He has had a history of drug usage, particularly using heroin and methylamphetamines since his late teens, particularly claiming to have used amphetamines from his mid twenties. He claimed that he was using heroin and methylamphetamine excessively at the time of the commission of the subject offence. He claimed a lack of clear recollection of relevant events. 

19The summary provided by the Probation and Parole Service is that the prisoner is a man with an extensive history of unsatisfactory response to supervision of this Service and has a history of unaddressed dependence to illicit substances. He continues to have alcohol and drug issues and violent acts against members of his local community are consequences of this dependency.

20The Probation and Parole Service made the point that he had not fully engaged with the Service in regards to addressing his crimogenic behaviour. Whilst it is felt that he could benefit from supervision from the Service, his prior negative response to supervision brings into doubt the utility of future supervision by the Service. 

21This evidence is not challenged. The prisoner has not given evidence to challenge the factual assumptions in the report and no submissions were even made about the Probation and Parole Service report. This augurs badly for a finding that would extend the period of supervision. But I have made a finding of ""special circumstances"" for two reasons. There should be an adjustment of the otherwise appropriate nonparole period with a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to provide the prisoner with professional assistance to adjust to community living and to give him an opportunity to get the benefit of the supervision of the Parole Service to address the issues that have contributed to his offending and because the sentence that I impose will be partially accumulative upon the consequences of the revocation of parole. 

22The consequences of the revocation of parole, which ultimately was backdated to 14 September 2011, the date of his arrest in relation to this matter, is that he has a balance of sentence arising from the revocation of parole which commences on 14 September 2011 and expires on 22 September 2013. That is a period on my calculation of two years and six or seven days. I was informed from the bar table that for various reasons he cannot first apply for parole, without any action taken by this Court I hasten to say, for a period of twelve months since the backdated date of the commencement of the revocation of parole. I was told that the revocation of parole was governed by s 237A Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. 

23Of course predicting the future and what the Parole authority might do or might have done without these charges is a matter of pure speculation on my part. But the reality is in the context of the seriousness of the offending with which I am concerned that any sentence I must impose in accordance with the law would extend beyond the period of the balance of the sentence, the subject of the parole revocation. Thus the sentence I impose overtakes to some extent the prisoner's current situation as a consequence of the revocation of parole.

24In determining how to deal with the issue of the fixing of the commencement of the current sentence I have taken into account the submission of learned counsel for the prisoner, Mr Rahme, that I should sentence the prisoner by imposing a sentence that commences on the date of sentence that would be, I take it, last week when the matter came before me. 

25I was referred by both the Crown and the defence to the decision of Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58. I am familiar with the judgment of Simpson J, particularly in which her Honour considered the issues that arise in the sentencing of an offender to a term of imprisonment where there exists a revocation of parole. Her Honour canvassed a number of judgments of the Court. Amongst other things she noted the discretionary character of the decision so far as fixing a commencement date in accordance with the provisions of s 47 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and also she emphasised the need to ensure that in sentencing an offender in the circumstances one should not 'double dip'. As I will point out, by reference to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the prisoner's crime of possessing a firearm contrary to s 7 of the Firearms Act was a substantial breach of the original parole order made, even though that parole order had been revoked. This is, of course, thus a significant aggravation following upon the terms of the relevant provision in s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In any event, in considering the commencement date of the sentence, I have had close regard to Callaghan. 

26I cannot accede to the submission of Mr Rahme. On the other hand obviously I should not make the sentence I impose entirely accumulative upon the balance of the sentence to be served as a consequence of the revocation of parole. I will commence the sentence 12 months into the balance of the parole period.

27With regard to the subjective case raised by the prisoner, some material was tendered in the nature of character or work references, but the primary material relied upon, in fact the primary material in the defence case is to be found in the reports of Ms Anita Duffy, who has had prior clinical contact with the prisoner as far back as 2003 and in the report of Dr Olav Nielssen, a respected forensic psychiatrist, that report dated 1 February 2012. 

28Ms Duffy discusses the prisoner's background as provided by him and the history of his drug usage, the circumstances of his relationships and the circumstances of the matters that the prisoner said were pertinent to the commission of the principal offence. She noted that he claimed to have been quite paranoid, believing that he was on a list of possible targets following upon the death of his brother-in-law. I have noted the hearsay assertions of the prisoner within that report and the report of Dr Nielssen. The prisoner has given a generally consistent account to those persons, including the Probation and Parole Service officer, who have taken histories.

29So far as Ms Duffy is concerned, she found in relation to intelligence testing that the prisoner was a person with a level of non-verbal intelligence in the lower second percentile of ""population norms"" with his verbal abilities in the same area of functioning. He had a potential to undertake semiskilled or skilled practical work. It is not submitted that he is intellectually disabled. Initially when I read that passage on the run I misunderstood its terms, but it is submitted that he is in the lower levels of normal intelligence, consistent with the observations of Dr Nielssen.

30On personality testing, without detailing the manner of testing, Ms Duffy found that his ""only significant result"" was on the ""depressive measure"" and his ""antisocial score"", as it was called, was just below significance. His scoring on ""paranoia"" was not statistically significant. He had a highly elevated result on the measure of anxiety and had significant scores on the measures of depression, drug dependence and post-traumatic stress disorder. This reflected his history of being exposed to incidents which has caused fear including his abuse as a child and acts of violence occurring in his presence or to members of his family. His recurring difficulties with substance abuse was consistent with the testing as to his drug dependence scale. He had high feelings of sadness, pessimism, guilt and low self esteem. 

31In relation to the issue of risk assessment and treatment consideration, it was found that his risk of general and violent recidivism amongst people of his age was moderate to high. It also emerged from the testing that he had a moderate to a high need for assignment to treatment options. His scores were significant on matters relating to conduct problems, criminal history, drug and alcohol abuse and antisocial associates. The alcohol and drug abuse and antisocial associate scales returned in his testing suggested ""the need for specific programs to address his substance abuse and to deal with peer pressure"". 

32Her conclusion was that he was a person, having regard to the testing and his background and his history of imprisonment, who was in need of programs to assist him to adjust to community living and to avoid criminal and antisocial contacts. She noted significantly that she had seen him on a number of occasions between 2003 and the present and she noted his growing maturity and increased self awareness and behavioural controls. One of the features of his presentation to people is that notwithstanding the very bleak picture that emerges on the paper, the prisoner is a person who has an engaging personality and presents openly and in a friendly way to the interviewers. Not that that necessarily is a final determinative of his potential risk to the community. 

33Ms Duffy was of the view that the prisoner did not necessarily espouse criminal or antisocial beliefs but was rather ""prone to being adversely influenced by those around him into criminal activities"". He needs counselling in custody and in the wider community, particularly through a psychologist. She noted his marriage, as I understand it some fourteen months ago, has provided a stabilising influence, but that having been said, on the chronology I have, the prisoner was married at the time of the commission of these offences.

34Dr Nielssen provided a similar history, noting the prisoner's disadvantaged background in a number of respects. He made a diagnosis, on the prisoner's mental state examination and with the history available as well as other papers provided, that the prisoner had a substance abuse disorder which was in remission on the basis that he was not using drugs in custody. He also made a diagnosis of substanceinduced psychotic disorder based upon the prisoner's account of episodes of persecutory delusional beliefs triggered by the use of methylamphetamine. He said the pattern of symptoms was typical of drug-induced states rather than schizophrenialike psychosis and the episodes resolved soon after ceasing drugs, without any treatment.

35He believed that the prisoner may have been sensitised for developing psychosis as a result of his abuse of cannabis and stimulant drugs in early adolescence, an important period of brain development and thus disrupted him such as to trigger psychoses. He said however there was little in the way of disorganised thinking. He did not believe there was an emergence of chronic mental illness. He thought that the firearms offence would ""appear to be directly linked to both of his disorders"" because his psychotic episodes left him irrationally fearful of his immediate safety and his substance abuse resulted in a lifestyle where he had genuine reason to be afraid. There may have been a link with his history of sexual abuse in childhood that he claims and the onset of substance abuse and antisocial conduct may have its origins in this disadvantaged background. 

36He expressed the opinion of the prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation were directly related to his future substance abuse. He needed a graded prerelease program, some day release to prepare for subsequent release and ongoing drug counselling and other measures on his release.

37I have gone into this material in some detail because the primary matter that was raised in the submissions of the defence, as I earlier indicated, was the issue of the relationship of any ""mental illness"" to the offending behaviour and the related question of whether there should be a diminution upon punishment and/or general deterrence in the sentencing process to recognise that particular condition. 

38His counsel also referred to the fact that the prisoner clearly had become institutionalised over a number of years throughout his early adulthood of imprisonment. It was submitted that the critical issue in relation to his mental condition was whether apart from the issue of general deterrence and related matters, the issue of whether there was special circumstances. It was conceded that he was not mentally retarded. 

39The Crown said in its submissions that if less weight was given to general deterrence, in his case greater weight should be given to specific deterrence. 

40Dealing with this aspect of the submissions, having surveyed this evidence, I note the authorities to which is I was referred in submission, particularly the judgment of R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. In Hemsley. Sperling J [33] summarised the position which I understand still applies in respect of dealing with an offender suffering from a mental illness. He said:

""Mental illness may be relevant in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced; there may then not be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted and that may accordingly be reduced: 

Furthermore mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence (the matter discussed in Engert (1995) and in the late Badgery-Parker J's judgment in Letteri). 

Thirdly a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person. A fourth and countervailing consideration may be that the level of danger which the offender presents to the community might require consideration in special deterrence (noting the judgment of Israil).""

41In relation to these matters, firstly, there is no evidence that the prisoner is currently suffering from a mental illness or that his circumstances of custody weigh more heavily upon him because of the conditions diagnosed by Dr Nielssen. Furthermore, in considering the issue of mental illness, as it is discussed in relation to the first two points made by Sperling J, it is of course very much a matter of the character of the mental illness and the way in which it affects the offender and the strength of the causal connection between the mental illness and the offending behaviour. The person with a schizophrenic condition short of the defence of mental illness, who acts in a certain way as an expression of the illness may, subject to considerations of specific deterrence, have a lower moral culpability or may not be an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence. Likewise a person who suffers from a significant mental disability such as what might be described as reduced intellectual capacity might not be an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence. 

42I point out in this particular matter that whilst the opinions of Dr Nielssen are not substantially challenged, he certainly was not requested to be crossexamined and no countervailing evidence is available, the relationship between what he diagnosed as the relevant mental conditions and the offending behaviour is not particularly strong, particularly having regard to the prisoner's own account of the reasons for obtaining the firearm.

43The facts of the matter are that even if he was paranoid and that paranoia was induced by some drug psychosis, which is not a chronic condition, the prisoner had, on his version, real reasons for having fear for himself and his family because his brother-in-law was murdered. That was not a fictitious or imaginary event. The other problem I have with Dr Nielssen's report is that the prisoner has given no details as to when he acquired the gun and the circumstances of its acquisition. For all I know he may have had the gun from a short time after he got out of gaol. Thus for up to a period of something in the order of ten months or so ago, and he continued to have possession of the gun, not just on the day of his arrest. He clearly had the firearm for some period of time beforehand. The crime he has admitted to is the crime of the possession of the firearm. That was a continuing possession. There is no evidence that he was in a continuing psychotic condition. Of course arming himself may have been a consequence of the paranoia induced, but he was not in a continual state of mental illness even on the analysis of Dr Nielssen and must have had opportunities to reflect upon his possession of the gun. 

44The firearm offence, of course, was a calculated matter and the fact that he was both in possession of the gun and the gun was loaded, reflects upon the calculation of the prisoner. Again demonstrating, allowing for Dr Nielssen's opinions, the capability of the prisoner to make rational and calculated decisions about matters relevant to the offending behaviour. 

45That is not to say I completely discount Dr Nielssen's assessment. It may explain aspects of the prisoner's behaviour and, ultimately, in the context of what I might call ""Hemsley principles"" if there be some lessening upon the emphasis of punishment and general deterrence it is, on the evidence, slight. I also note that Mrs Duffy's assessments are not altogether in accord with the assessments of Dr Nielssen. Mrs Duffy, who is not a medical practitioner of course, says symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder exist. I see no reference to that condition in the analysis of Dr Nielssen. Again, had that not been said I accept that there are a number of features in the prisoner's background that have impacted upon his development, some of which are beyond his control. 

46The matters that do arise from the psychological and the medical evidence are clearly matters that remain relevant for the determination of the fixing of non-parole period and underline the emphasis that should be given on extending the appropriate non-parole period to reflect the need for an extended period of time for supervision to assist the prisoner to adjust to community living if he is capable of doing it. 

47The principal offence has a standard non-parole period. The Crown provided a brief summary of the principles set out in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39, particularly at [25] to [30]. It noted that the relevance of the standard non-parole period on the determination of the High Court was not a starting point for sentencing for an offence in the mid range after conviction. The Court is not required to start by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, nor does the Court need to proceed to an assessment of whether the offences are in the middle range of objective seriousness. Instead the Court must identify all the factors that are relevant, identify their significance and make a value judgment about the appropriate sentence in accordance with the decision of Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357. The standard non-parole period of course remains important as a guidepost, along with the maximum penalty. In doing so courts must bear in mind the standard non-parole period is a non-parole period ""for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" and place the guidepost in that context. 

48Muldrock is beginning to become the subject of a number of commentaries by the Court of Criminal Appeal. A recent judgment I have read is R v Foster [2011] NSWCCA 285, where Adams J examined the matter in some detail. His views on Muldrock were not embraced wholeheartedly by Hoeben and McClellan JJ, but it was acknowledged by Hoeben J that he did not suggest Adams J's analysis was wrong and McClellan J would appear to have reserved upon the detail of that analysis. In any event, much of what Adams J discussed involved merely repeating what was contained within Muldrock. 

49In this particular matter there are a range of matters to take into account. First of all the offence itself by reference to its character was an offence involving the prisoner being in possession of a very dangerous firearm which was loaded at the time in circumstances that are not explained. With regard to the prisoner's explanation for his possession of the firearm there was no evidence of any current threat at the time of his arrest and there were no details of any specific threats made to the prisoner in the period of time between October 2010 and the commission of the offence in September 2011. Noting that the mid range is not a ""narrow band"" as discussed in the decision of Way, it can be seen that the character of the firearm and the fact that it was loaded would place this offence very much towards the upper level of the mid range at least. I make this finding on the basis of the character of the firearm, the fact that it was a firearm capable of rapid fire, it was a firearm obviously illegally obtained by the prisoner in that it was a firearm that presented itself as a stolen or otherwise illegally obtained gun with no serial number. It was, as I said, an offence aggravated by the prisoner's possession of the gun in a loaded state capable of being fired within seconds by simply disengaging any safety mechanism upon it. 

50Of course there is no suggestion the prisoner was about to use the gun or had used the gun or threatened to use the gun. However, it is the potential of the firearm to cause harm and the character of the firearm which gives rise to the attraction of a fourteen year maximum term of imprisonment and the standard non-parole period. There are no matters raised either by the prisoner, and the hearsay accounts he has given, or in the objective facts, to suggest that this possession was transitory.

51As I have pointed out, the events giving rise to the need for self protection occurred almost a year before and the prisoner has been completely silent about the time in which the gun was in his possession. This was a matter, as I said, Dr Nielssen did not address and with respect to Dr Nielssen's opinion there is nothing in the material available to me, nor anything in his report, that suggests that the accused was suffering a psychotic episode at the time of his arrest. 

52The prisoner's failure to provide a reliable account as to the acquisition of the firearm is of course a matter of some concern. Clearly he has the means to obtain such a firearm, the means which would not be available to the general citizenry. An act of contrition on the part of the prisoner could have been to identify the source of the firearm to ensure that the person who supplied this firearm could be prevented from providing similar firearms to other people. I cannot punish the prisoner additionally for his silence and I can understand the reasons why he may not wish to implicate any other person. It is a matter of deep concern, as the community expresses at the moment with events in western Sydney in recent months, that people have access to firearms which are capable of causing death and serious injury or disturbance to the community.

53As I have pointed out earlier, another aggravating feature, this time arising under s 21A(2), is that the offence was committed whilst the prisoner was subject to parole and, more importantly, the parole itself had been revoked because the prisoner had failed to comply with the very basic condition of that. 

54The prisoner's reason for having the firearm for personal protection provides little, if any, mitigation, as the Crown pointed out in judgments such as Thalari v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 170 and R v AA. Personal protection provides little or any mitigation for possession of a firearm. The Court in Thalari said:

""The rule of law and the authority of courts depends upon the propositions that persons do not by legal means take their protection into their own hands.""

55There is also a decision of Yammine [2010] NSWCCA 123 setting out relevant observations on this matter. 

56The Crown doubted the prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation and one, of course, must be somewhat sanguine about them. One could not make a positive finding in light of the history of the prisoner that there is real prospects of rehabilitation, however Ms Duffy in her findings from her testing and her observation of the prisoner, reflected upon the capacity of the prisoner with more stable domestic circumstances to better his life. The finding of special circumstances that I have foreshadowed assumes that the prisoner may take advantage on the next time he is released to the advantages of a lawful existence in the community.

57The Crown made submissions in relation to the dating of the sentence which I have taken into account. I have already dealt with that matter. 

58So far as mitigating matters other than those to which I have referred, under s 21A(3) relevant to the fixing of the appropriate sentence, ultimately I could not find that this offence was part of ""planned or organised criminal activity"". There is no suggestion the prisoner used the firearm to commit a particular crime. The planning involved in it was not of the character that would warrant a finding of planning as it is anticipated under s 21A(2). 

59The prisoner has no other matters of significance that arise under s 21A(3). I could not find that he is unlikely to re-offend and, as I said, one must keep an open mind about his prospects of his rehabilitation. Certainly I could not find a positive finding of good prospects of rehabilitation. The prisoner has expressed regret, but the Probation and Parole Service did not regard him as being particularly regretful. In any event, he has not provided the relevant material that would provide a basis for a finding of remorse on his part in accordance with s 21A(3)(i). I do note, however, the plea of guilty is a mitigating matter. But for that, of course, the prisoner receives a discrete discount. 

60To go back to the start, the prisoner was on the run and ultimately the arming of himself for selfprotection provides no real mitigation. Being on parole at the time of the commission of the offence, and with his criminal history offering him no basis for leniency, a significant sentence is appropriate. Noting the standard nonparole period and the maximum penalty, I have concluded that the appropriate sentence for this offence has a starting point of six years imprisonment. I have granted the prisoner a discount of twentyfive per cent. Upon the sentence thus to be imposed I have determined that the nonparole period should be that of two years and three months, commencing from a date exactly one year after the commencement date of the revocation of his parole. 

61In arriving at those decisions I have determined that I should give some weight of course to the medical and psychological findings, but of course as ultimately was conceded in the submissions of the prisoner's counsel, the mitigation they provide, in conjunction with the other features of the case, could not be great because in the scheme of things, including the objective facts, the conditions particularly referred to by Dr Nelson provide little explanation for the prisoner's possession of the firearm. 

62Thus, in relation to the principal offence, Mr Zahed, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years and three months. That will commence on 14 September 2012 and will expire on 13 December 2014. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two years and three months. That balance of sentence will expire on 13 March 2017. 

63I cannot direct that you be released to parole on that date. It will be a matter for the Parole authorities, so it will be very much in your court. You may say to yourself, when I was younger I committed armed robberies and robberies in company and I got a sentence not much greater than the sentence that has been imposed today. But the problem is, of course, that given the maximum penalty for the offence and some of the aggravating factors and the fact that you committed the offence on parole, the hands of the Court are somewhat tied. 

64I have made allowance to try and provide you with an opportunity of an earlier release to parole than might otherwise be the case, which will be some time in the future and I trust you will take the opportunity to take it. You have got an attractive wife to look forward to joining when you leave gaol and you have got reasons, if you are serious about it, to lead a lawful lifestyle. The problem you have got is if you want to continue committing offences, you will end up spending longer and longer in gaol and ultimately I am sure that that is something that you do not wish to happen. 

65For the possess ammunition offence, you are convicted and you are fined $1,000. I grant you twentyeight days to pay. 

66In relation to the goods in personal custody charge regarding the cash, I sentence you to three months imprisonment. That term of imprisonment will start on 14 September 2012 and expire on 13 December 2012.

		19 September 2012",2012-02-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708660,NSW Crime Commission v Dib [2012] NSWSC 99,"Judgment 

1This was an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. Section 10A enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst (as here) there is an application pending for an assets forfeiture order (see s 10D). 

2I made orders at the time of the making of the application, and I indicated that I would provide reasons for doing so at a later time. These are my reasons. 

3The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 24 January 2012 In that affidavit Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer as defined in s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, being the offences of dishonestly obtaining money be deception contrary to s 178BA(1) Crimes Act 1900 and obtaining money by false or misleading statement contrary to s 178BB(1) Crimes Act 1900. These both fall within the definition of ""serious criminal offence"", in s 6(2)(b) CARA . 

4The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in paragraph 4 of his affidavit. In short, he has read a Facts Sheet obtained from the NSW Police which he has annexed to his affidavit. He enquired of the officer who prepared the Facts Sheet if he had prepared it, whether the officer believed it was true, and if the information was obtained by the Police as a result of the investigation described in the Facts Sheet. The officer concerned confirmed the matters asked of him. 

5In addition, Mr Spark had enquiries made by an officer of the Commission which disclosed that the Defendant had been charged with the offences described in the Facts Sheet. 

6Section 10(5) requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. 

7I have read the material in the Facts Sheet. The matters in the Facts Sheet, if true, are sufficient to show that these offences have been committed. The Accused provided false employment documents to Westpac to obtain a loan. Those matters plainly afford reasonable grounds for the suspicion deposed to by Mr Spark. Further, having regard to the source of information Mr Spark had and the terms of the email with the officer who provided the Facts Sheet to Mr Spark, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for him to form his suspicion on the assumption that the contents of the Facts Sheet were true. 

8For those reasons I consider there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. 

9I am further satisfied, as s 10A(3) requires, from the material annexed to Mr Spark's affidavit, that the Defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and that the property in respect of which the restraining order is sought is situated in New South Wales. 

10Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the Defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence concerning the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of or transferred I do not consider that the Defendant should be given notice of this application before an order is made. 

11Because I was satisfied that Mr Spark had reasonable grounds for his suspicion, s 10A(5) of the Act obliged me to make a restraining order. I considered also that it was appropriate to make the ancillary orders sought which were contained in paras 2-8 of a draft Order.

		22 February 2012",2012-01-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708663,NSW Crime Commission v Younan [2012] NSWSC 13,"Judgment 

1This was an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. Section 10A enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst (as here) there is an application pending for an assets forfeiture order (see s 10D). 

2I made orders at the time of the making of the application, and I indicated that I would provide reasons for doing so at a later time. These are my reasons. 

3The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 24 January 2011. In that affidavit Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer as defined in s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, being the offence of demanding property with menaces with intent to steal contrary to s 99 of the Crimes Act 1900. This is a ""serious criminal offence"", as defined in s 6(2)(b) of the Act. 

4The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in paragraph 4 of his affidavit. In short, he has read a Facts Sheet obtained from the NSW Police which he has annexed to his affidavit. He enquired of the officer who prepared the Facts Sheet if he had prepared it, whether the officer believed it was true, and if the information was obtained by the Police as a result of the investigation described in the Facts Sheet. The officer concerned confirmed the matters asked of him. 

5In addition, Mr Spark had enquiries made by an officer of the Commission which disclosed that the Defendant had been charged with the offence described in the Facts Sheet. 

6Section 10(5) requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. 

7I have read the material in the Facts Sheet. The matters in the Facts Sheet, if true, are sufficient to show that the offence of demand money with menaces with intent to steal has been committed. Those matters plainly afford reasonable grounds for the suspicion deposed to by Mr Spark. Further, having regard to the source of information Mr Spark had and the terms of the email with the officer who prepared the Facts Sheet, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for him to form his suspicion on the assumption that the contents of the Facts Sheet were true. 

8For those reasons I consider there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. 

9I am further satisfied, as s 10A(3) requires, from the material annexed to Mr Spark's affidavit, that the Defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and that the property in respect of which the restraining order is sought is situated in New South Wales. 

10Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the Defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence concerning the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of or transferred I do not consider that the Defendant should be given notice of this application before an order is made. 

11There has been a difference of opinion within the Court about the need to provide reasons for the making of ex parte orders under this Act following the enactment of the Criminal Assets Recovery Amendment Act 2009. 

12In NSW Crime Commission v Shane John Meads [2010] NSWSC 1145 Garling J concluded that in the light of the amendments to the legislation in 2009 reasons were no longer required to be delivered when an ex parte application was made for a restraining order under s 10A (see at [33]). His Honour's principal reason for that conclusion appears to have been that the revised procedure contained in the Amendment Act , and particularly the enactment of s 10C, sufficiently aligned that procedure to what was followed on any other ex parte application to the Court. His Honour noted at [28] that the Court's ordinary practice has not been to give reasons when granting such ex parte relief either by way of restraining order, or otherwise. His Honour also called in aid Cl 17(3)(c) of Schedule 1 to the Act. 

13Section 10C provides: 

10C Review of restraining orders 

(1) The Supreme Court may, on the application of a person whose interest in property is affected by a restraining order, set aside the order on any of the following grounds: 

(a) that, having regard to the affidavit supporting the restraining order application and any other evidence adduced, the Commission has failed to satisfy the Court that there are reasonable grounds for the relevant suspicion referred to in section 10A (5), 

(b) that the applicant has established that the order was obtained illegally or against good faith. 

(2) An application under this section by a person is to be made not later than 28 days after the person is notified of the order or may be made at any time with the leave of the Supreme Court. 

(3) If an application is made under this section, the restraining order concerned remains in force unless and until an order is made by the Supreme Court to set aside the order. 
(4) A person who applies for an order is entitled to adduce evidence at the application. 

14In New South Wales Crimes Commission v Warren Richards [2010] NSWSC 1399 McCallum J declined to follow Meads . The view her Honour took was that what had been said by the Court of Appeal in International Finance Trust Company Limited v New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] NSWCA 291 concerning the need for reasons was not affected by the decision of the High Court which declared the unamended form of the legislation invalid: International Finance Trust Company Limited v New South Wales Crime Commission [2009] HCA 49. In addition, her Honour took the view that the amendments to the Act did not sufficiently align an ex parte application under the Act with the usual class of urgent ex parte applications for restraining orders in civil proceedings: Richards at [12]. 

15With great respect to Garling J, I prefer the reasoning of McCallum J. I do so, particularly, when comparing the usual class of ex parte orders with the regime under the Amendment Act . The regime provided in the Amendment Act does not automatically return the proceedings to the Court after the ex parte restraining orders have been made. The matter will only return if an application is made by the Defendant under s 10C. 

16The procedure under s 10C differs from the procedure on the return of an ex parte order in a number of respects. Some of these are pointed out by McCallum J in Richards at [12]. They may be summarised as follows: 

(i) On the return of an ordinary ex parte application it will be for the Plaintiff to establish again, ordinarily with the Defendant present, the right to such an order. This is because the usual practice in equity is to grant an injunction for a very short period within which notice of it is given to the Defendant: IFTC [2009] HCA 49 at [149]. By comparison, the Defendant must apply under s 10C to set aside the ex parte order made; 

(ii) Although it is not completely clear, the wording of s 10C suggests that there is an onus upon the Defendant to establish one of the grounds. By comparison, in the usual case, the onus is on the Plaintiff again to establish its right to the order for a further period; 

(iii) Because the application under s 10C is limited to two grounds it would not appear that any other bases for challenging the order would be available. In the usual case a failure by the Plaintiff to demonstrate complete frankness when an ex parte was obtained would disentitle the Plaintiff to a further order on the return date. Whether that is embraced by the term ""against good faith"" may be arguable. 

17Further, a defendant making an application under s 10C will be at a considerable disadvantage in attempting to set aside an ex parte order if the defendant does not know, from reasons delivered at the time the ex parte order was made, the basis for the making of the order. That is particularly so when the section appears to place an onus on the defendant to establish one of the grounds stipulated. 

18Since the decision in Meads was given the High Court has delivered judgment in Wainohu v New South Wales [2011] HCA 24. The judgments there identified the general duty of judges to give reasons for judicial decisions and linked that duty with the nature of judicial power: see at [53] - [58], [68], [70], [104], [109]. The statements there made are strong indications that the other changes made by the Amendment Act are not to be regarded as sufficient to obviate the general duty to provide reasons for applications of this sort. 

19In my opinion what was said in Wainohu is sufficient to dispose of any support which might otherwise have been derived from Cl 17(3)(c) of Schedule 1 to the Act. If that provision was thought to provide a legislative imprimatur for not providing reasons, the provision is likely to be invalid because it authorises the purported exercise of judicial function with an essential incident missing: Wainohu at [68]. 

20For the reasons given earlier in this judgment I was satisfied that Mr Spark had reasonable grounds for his suspicion. In those circumstances s10A(5) of the Act obliged me to make a restraining order. I considered also that it was appropriate to make the ancillary orders sought which were contained in paras 2-7 of a draft Order.

		22 February 2012",2012-01-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708675,Maritime Authority of NSW v Nikolai Rofe [2012] NSWSC 5,"Judgment 

1On 14 February 2010, the defendant Petty Officer Nikolai Rofe - a member of the Royal Australian Navy posted to the Australian Defence Force Academy ('ADFA') where he was the Senior Non-Commissioned Officer in charge of the Seamanship Centre and Boatshed - was responsible for the conduct of an adventure training activity for ADFA officer trainees (officer cadets and midshipmen, for convenience in this judgment collectively referred to as 'officer cadets') using a 6.3 metre rigid hull inflatable boat with an outboard motor and unguarded propeller ('the vessel'), on Lake Burrinjuck near Yass. After completion of fast water insertion exercises, Petty Officer Rofe took a number of officer cadets out on the vessel for what was variously described as a ""sea jolly"", ""joy ride"" or ""bit of fun"", in the course of which Officer Cadet Oliver Minchin fell from the vessel and suffered horrific injuries after his lower back connected with the propeller, resulting in the loss of approximately four litres of blood. On 21 December 2010, the Local Court at Yass (Magistrate Beattie) dismissed charges brought against Petty Officer Rofe by the Maritime Authority of New South Wales ('the Authority'), under (NSW) Marine Safety Act 1998, s 13(1)(b), for operating a commercial vessel recklessly occasioning grievous bodily harm, and s 13(1)(a), for operating a commercial vessel negligently occasioning grievous bodily harm. By summons filed on 17 January 2011, Sean O'Dwyer in his capacity as a Public Officer of the Authority appeals against the Magistrate's order dismissing the proceedings. 

2The Authority contends that the learned Magistrate erred in law in dismissing the charges, specifically on the following grounds: 

(1)in holding that for the purposes of Marine Safety Act s 13(1)(a) and s 13(1)(b), the existence of a possibility of serious harm was not sufficient to constitute recklessness and/or negligence; 

(2)in holding that contravention of s 13(1)(a) required a high and significantly culpable degree of negligence, being a higher degree of negligence than the standard applicable under civil law; 

(3)in treating the facts that the officer cadets who participated in the relevant boat rides did so for fun and willingly as exculpatory for the purposes of s 13(1)(a) and s 13(1)(b); 

(4)a fourth ground was not pressed; and 

(5)in failing to hold that the facts as found constituted a contravention of s 13(1)(b) or alternatively s 13(1)(a) of the Act. 

3Some days before the hearing of the appeal, counsel for both parties were informed of my role with the Australian Defence Force - which involves no responsibility for or association with any part or member of the Defence Force involved in this case - and afforded an opportunity to take instructions in that respect. Neither party objected to my hearing the matter. 

The Marine Safety Act 

4The objects of the Marine Safety Act are set out in s 3, as follows: 

(a) to ensure the safe operation of vessels in ports and other waterways, 

(b) to promote the responsible operation of vessels in those waters so as to protect the safety and amenity of other users of those waters and the amenity of occupiers of adjoining land, 

(c) to provide for the investigation of marine accidents and for appropriate action following any such investigation, 

(d) to consolidate marine safety legislation. 

5Section 13, which is headed ""Reckless, dangerous or negligent navigation and other acts"" provides as follows: 

(1) A person must not operate a vessel in any navigable waters: 

(a) negligently, or 
(b) recklessly, or 
(c) at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public. 

Maximum penalty: 
(a) if the operation of the vessel occasions death or grievous bodily harm - 1,000 penalty units (where the vessel is a seagoing ship), 100 penalty units (where the vessel is any other commercial vessel) or 50 penalty units (where the vessel is a recreational vessel), or imprisonment for 2 years, or both, or 
(b) if the operation of the vessel does not occasion death or grievous bodily harm - 1,000 penalty units (where the vessel is a seagoing ship), 100 penalty units (where the vessel is any other commercial vessel) or 50 penalty units (where the vessel is a recreational vessel). 

(2) A person who is on a vessel in navigable waters, or is being towed by such a vessel, must not do anything that is dangerous to the public. 

Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units. 

(3) In considering whether an offence has been committed under this section, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following: 

(a) the nature and condition of the waters in which the offence is alleged to have been committed, 
(b) the amount of traffic that actually is at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, in those waters. 

(4) The higher maximum penalty under paragraph (a) of the maximum penalty in subsection (1) does not apply unless it is alleged in the charge for the offence that the conduct concerned occasioned death or grievous bodily harm. 

(5) In this section: 

dangerous to the public includes anything that causes or is likely to cause injury to any person or damage to any property. 
grievous bodily harm includes any permanent or serious disfigurement. 
seagoing ship means a commercial vessel of more than 45.72 metres in length that is used or intended to be used to carry cargo or passengers for hire or reward and that normally operates on voyages between ports. 

6'Operate' is defined in s 4(1) to include determining or exercising control over the course or direction of a vessel or the means of propulsion of a vessel, and piloting a vessel. 'Vessel' is defined by s 5 to include a watercraft of any description used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water. It is not in issue that the vessel was a 'commercial vessel' for the purposes of the Act. ""Navigable waters"" are defined in s 4 to mean all waters (whether or not in the state of New South Wales) that are from time to time capable of navigation and are open to or used by the public for navigation, whether on payment of a fee or otherwise. It was and is not in dispute that the defendant was operating a vessel in navigable waters at the time of the alleged offence. 

7By operation of s 136, the Act binds the Crown in right of New South Wales and, so far as the legislative power of the New South Wales Parliament allows, the Crown in all its other capacities. Prima facie , the Act applies to the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, manifested in the instant case by the Australian Defence Force, and ADFA. Section 9 deals explicitly with the Act's application to vessels belonging to the Australian Defence Forces: 

(1) Except as provided by this section, this Act does not apply to or in respect of a vessel belonging to the Defence Force of Australia or to the naval, military or air forces of any other country. 

(2) Parts 2 and 3, Division 4 of Part 8 and Schedule 1 apply to and in respect of a vessel belonging to the Defence Force of Australia (other than a commissioned vessel) and to its master, crew and passengers. 

(3) In this section, a reference to a commissioned vessel includes a reference to any vessel carried on board or launched from a commissioned vessel. 

8Section 13 is contained in Part 2 of the Act, and the vessel was not a commissioned vessel; accordingly, the Act applied to the vessel operated by the defendant. 

Facts 

9The learned Magistrate outlined the incident giving rise to the charge, relevantly, as follows (at [5]-[9]): 

On 14 th February, 2010 a group of defence force cadets were attending adventure training exercises at Lake Burrinjuck. Without intending any disrespect I refer to all participants as cadets, but note that the group included officer cadets such as Mr Minchin, who had joined the defence forces some three weeks earlier on 20 th January 2010, and a year one midshipmen. 

During the morning this particular group received instruction in Fast Water Insertions, a technique for entering water from a vessel driven at speed. They then participated in progressively faster exercises in that technique on a 6.3 metre Arib NAIAD rigid hull inflatable boat operated by the defendant. This vessel had an outboard motor with a propeller at the rear. There was no guard or cover over the propeller and the defendant warned the cadets to avoid the rear of the vessel because the propeller would turn them into ""burley"". 

On completion of the Fast Water Insertions, and as a separate and voluntary activity, the defendant took groups of six cadets for what was variously described as a ""sea jolly"", a ""joy ride"", and a ""bit of fun"". This involved the defendant operating the vessel at speed and making quick sharp turns during which some cadets fell overboard and were subsequently recovered into the vessel. 

On the last of these rides, Mr King fell overboard at a turn, was recovered into the vessel, and swapped seats with Mr Minchin. The defendant then conducted another turn, and Mr Minchin and Ms Mason fell overboard and Mr Minchin's back came into contact with the uncovered propeller at the rear of the vessel. He felt pain and, together with Ms Mason, called for help. He was assisted back into the vessel, and the defendant radioed for help and headed for shore. 

Mr Minchin was subsequently airlifted to the Canberra Hospital, where he underwent surgery for multiple fractures and lacerations. The discharge summary refers to his having a ""massive transfusion - approx 4L blood loss"". 


10Her Honour proceeded to deal with the evidence of the witnesses (at [10]-[11]): 

Eight cadets, including Mr Minchin, gave substantially consistent evidence about these events. There were some differences as to speed, but the consensus was between the medium and the fast Fast Water Insertions exercises, during which the defendant stated that he attained speeds of twenty knots and more than twenty-five knots. There were also differences as to the number of cadets who fell overboard during the rides, and when that happened. However, looking at the totality of the evidence it is apparent that at least one cadet fell overboard in each of the six groups and that in two of the rides two cadets fell overboard, with Mr King falling in on two occasions in separate groups. This brings a total of at least eight cadets falling overboard during the various rides. 

The final key area of difference was their perception of the force that was involved as the boat turned. Mr Minchin stated, ""I felt like I couldn't hang on"" and ""It felt unexpected, quicker than I thought it would."" Other cadets spoke of being surprised and it being more powerful than they expected. Mr Babare spoke of the force as ""pretty steep"", but he had ""no trouble"" holding on for any of the turns. Mr George spoke of a ""constant outward pull... no jerking... you could easily hold on if you wanted to"" and Ms Telford referred to the force as increasing as the propeller gripped and that was when people would fall out, ""because they were not holding on properly or hard enough"", although these latter two were both year one midshipmen, with prior experience in similar vessels, in contrast to other cadets. Nonetheless, all these agree that there was a force and people who were unable to maintain a hold fell overboard. 

The Magistrate's decision 

11Her Honour summarised the prosecution argument as that the defendant operated the vehicle in a manner to cause a real risk of harm by taking the cadets for ""joyrides at high speeds with sharp turns and the object was to create significant momentum with the plainly foreseeable consequence that the cadets would fall overboard""; that the defendant had conceded, in cross-examination, that any person overboard was a ""serious event""; that by creating that situation the defendant was exposing participants to danger, particularly from the unguarded propeller; and that by creating and persisting in these risks he operated the vessel recklessly, or alternatively carelessly. Her Honour then concluded as follows (at [27]-[31]): 

However, there is no evidence as to the significance of propeller strike in this context, only that, unfortunately, it can occur. There is no explanation as to why or why only Mr Minchin came into contact with the propeller; there is nothing from which it can be concluded that falling overboard would place a cadet in proximity with the propeller. There were certainly submissions as to momentum, but no evidence as to this or as to where cadets hit the water in relation to the rear of the vessel. There is insufficient information from which to answer the question, beyond reasonable doubt, was this a horrific and remarkable incident or was it a real risk, something to be expected. 

The prosecution case asks me to assume that there was a real risk simply from cadets falling out of the vessel, but the evidence is not consistent with that: at least seven fell out without incident. It also asked me to accept that there was a real risk of propeller strike, but again there is no evidence of that, only that there was this one instance. The evidence does not distinguish between whether the activity was inherently risky and therefore reckless or criminally negligent, or simply a freak occurrence, an accident. 

Clearly Mr Minchin suffered significant injuries as a result of falling from the vessel and being struck by the propeller. Clearly cadets were going to fall overboard as the boat turned sharply; that was the fun or ""adrenalin rush"" of the activity: whether you could hold on. 

However, I am not satisfied that the risk of injury from the propeller was a real one in the facts and circumstances of this case. There is evidence to support the possibility of that danger, but not that the defendant's operation of the vessel was such as to create ""an obvious and serious risk"" and that he nonetheless took that risk. and that he was therefore reckless. 

Similarly, while negligence here does not require recognition of risk it does require a criminally culpable degree of carelessness, something that departs from the standard of care expected of the ordinary prudent operator. The defendant told the cadets where to sit, how and where to hang on, and to lean in the opposite direction; they had earlier been warned about the propeller; he gave them warning in advance of each turn and the direction it would take. While the defendant's manner of operating the vessel caused them to fall overboard, it did not depart from that expected standard of care and was not criminally negligent. 

Question of law alone 

12The appeal is brought pursuant to (NSW) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, s 56, which relevantly provides: 

Appeals as of right 

(1) The prosecutor may appeal to the Supreme Court against: 

... 

(c) an order made by the Local Court dismissing a matter the subject of any summary proceedings... 

... but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone. 

13Accordingly, the right of appeal is limited to a question of law alone (and does not extend to a mixed question of fact and law), and it is not open to this court to review the Magistrate's findings of fact, which must be accepted as conclusive. This is of particular relevance to Ground 5. 

Ground 1 - Is the mere possibility of serious harm sufficient? 

14The Authority's first ground of appeal is that the Magistrate erred in holding that the existence of a possibility of serious harm was insufficient to found recklessness or, in the alternative, negligence, for the purposes of s 13(1)(b) and s 13(1)(a) respectively. This is a question of construction of a statutory provision, and is necessarily a question of law [ Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280, 287]. 

15The essence of her Honour's relevant reasoning was as follows: 

(1)The fundamental issue in the case was whether the defendant operated the vessel recklessly or negligently for the purposes of s 13(1)(a) and s 13(1)(b) of the Act, by driving it at speed with sharp turns that caused the cadets to fall overboard, in the context of the vessel having an uncovered rear propeller (at [12]). 

(2)Recklessness (for the purposes of s 13(1)(b)) involves operating a vessel in a manner which in fact created a real risk of harmful consequences, so that it must be established that the defendant was operating the vessel in such a manner as to create an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury, and did so without having given any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or, having recognised that some risk was involved, nonetheless took that risk (at [16]) [citing R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510; [1981] 1 All ER 974 , 982 (Lord Diplock), which considered the offence of causing death by driving a motor vehicle recklessly under (UK) Road Traffic Act 1972, s 1, which provided that ""A person who causes the death of another person by driving a motor vehicle on a road recklessly shall be guilty of an offence""]. 

(3)Criminal negligence (for the purposes of s 13(1)(a)) is a different concept from and ought not be conflated with common law negligence (in the civil context); it involves placing other users at risk regardless of whether they are there; it is a criminally culpable degree of carelessness; there is no need for a defendant to recognise the risk, nor for any damage to be suffered; it involves a higher degree of negligence than in civil negligence cases, namely, acting without due care to a criminal grade (at [18]) [citing R v Buttsworth [1983] 1 NSWLR 658]. 

(4)There was insufficient evidence to answer, beyond reasonable doubt, whether this instance of propeller strike was a horrific and remarkable incident or ""a real risk, something to be expected"" (at [27]). The evidence did not enable the Court to distinguish between whether the activity was inherently risky and therefore reckless or criminally negligent, or simply a freak occurrence, an accident (at [28]). 

(5)Although there was evidence of the possibility of propeller strike, it was not established that it was a ""real"" one in the facts and circumstances or ""an obvious and serious risk"" (at [30]). 

(6)While negligence did not require recognition of risk, it required a criminally culpable degree of carelessness, a departure from the standard of care expected of the ordinary prudent operator. The defendant told the officer cadets where to sit, how and where to hang on, and to lean in the opposite direction; they had earlier been warned about the propeller; he gave them warning in advance of each turn and the direction it would take. While the defendant's manner of operating the vessel caused them to fall overboard, it did not depart from that expected standard of care and was not criminally negligent [at [31]]. 

16Accordingly, her Honour treated recklessness as requiring that there be more than a mere possibility of harmful consequences, but a ""real"" or ""obvious and serious"" risk, one that was ""something to be expected"" ; and negligence as requiring ""a criminally culpable degree of carelessness, a departure from the standard of care expected of the ordinary prudent operator"". 

17As Mr Kirk, who appeared for the Authority, submitted, the concept of 'risk' involves at least two elements - the first pertaining to the likelihood of an adverse event occurring (in terms of probability or possibility), and the second to the gravity of its consequences should it occur (in terms of whether they are serious or trivial). The Authority submitted that her Honour erred in requiring, for recklessness, more than a mere possibility of harmful consequences, and that all that was required was that the relevant consequences, at least if they were serious, be possible. 

18The starting point must be the terms of the Marine Safety Act, s 13. As Mr Odgers SC for the defendant submitted, in the context of criminal recklessness, three types of offences can be distinguished: those concerned with circumstances, those with consequences, and those with conduct. An example of an offence concerned with recklessness as to 'circumstances' is sexual assault under (NSW) Crimes Act 1900, s 61I - in which the relevant circumstance is that the complainant does not consent to sexual intercourse. An example of an offence concerned with recklessness as to 'consequences' is recklessly causing grievous bodily harm under Crimes Act, s 35(2). The offences of negligent driving of motor vehicles - and negligent navigation of vessels under s 13(1) of the Act - are concerned with reckless conduct. In the first two classes, recklessness goes to mens rea, but in the last (and relevant) class, it is also an element of the actus reus. 


19Driving a car, operating a vessel or flying an aircraft are activities that carry intrinsic risk but have social utility, and in this respect are manifestly different from activities such as sexual assault and inflicting grievous bodily harm. Although the maximum penalty is informed by the consequences, the offences created by s 13(1) are not themselves concerned with recklessness as to those consequences - namely, grievous bodily harm and death - but with reckless operation; s 13(1) does not require that any harm ensue, imposing (albeit lesser) penalties for reckless and negligent navigation without more. While s 13(3) provides that in considering whether an offence has been committed, the court is to have regard to 'all the circumstances of the case', it then specifies two such circumstances (the condition of the waters and amount of traffic on the water) which, though non-exclusive, concern factors going to the likelihood of harm occurring, as distinct from the gravity of any potential harm. While the objects of the Act - which include to ensure the safe operation of vessels and promote the responsible operation of vessels to protect the safety of other users of the water - might be a little further advanced by a construction that proscribed assumption of any risk however remote, in the context of s 13, which uses well known legal concepts of recklessness and negligence, and bearing in mind that it is a criminal statute, providing criminal penalties, and that - like the driving of motor vehicles - the operation of vessels is a socially useful activity that has inherent risks, it is unlikely in the extreme that Parliament intended to proscribe the assumption of any risk, or even any risk that might have grave consequences. 

20The test expressed by her Honour explicitly reflected that enunciated by Lord Diplock in t he motor vehicle case R v Lawrence, to which she had been referred by the prosecutor, and which is the leading authority on the offence of ""driving recklessly"". In that case, the House of Lords held that the actus reus of the offence of driving recklessly was driving in a manner that created an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to any other road user or substantial damage to property; while the mens rea was driving in such a manner without giving any thought to the risk or, having recognised that it existed, nevertheless running it. It was a question of fact whether the risk created by the accused's driving was both obvious and serious. Lord Diplock (with whom the other members of the House of Lords expressed agreement) said (at All ER, 981-982)(emphasis added): 

In ordinary usage 'recklessly' as descriptive of a physical act such as driving a motor vehicle which can be performed in a variety of different ways, some of them entailing danger and some of them not, refers not only to the state of mind of the doer of the act when he decides to do it but also qualifies the manner in which the act itself is performed. One does not speak of a person acting 'recklessly', even though he has given no thought at all to the consequences of his act, unless the act is one that presents a real risk of harmful consequences which anyone acting with reasonable prudence would recognise and give heed to. So the actus reus of the offence under ss 1 and 2 is not simply driving a motor vehicle on a road, but driving it in a manner which in fact creates a real risk of harmful consequences resulting from it. Since driving in such a manner as to do no worse than create a risk of causing inconvenience or annoyance to other road users constitutes the lesser offence under s 3, the manner of driving that constitutes the actus reus of the offence under ss 1 and 2 must be worse than that; it must be such a create a real risk of physical injury to someone else who happens to be using the road or damage to property more substantial than the kind of minor damage that may be caused by an error of judgment in the course of parking one's car. 

... 

I turn now to the mens rea . ... Recklessness on the part of the doer of an act does presuppose that there is something in the circumstances that would have drawn the attention of an ordinary prudent individual to the possibility that his act was capable of causing the kind of serious harmful consequences that the section which creates the offence was intended to prevent, and that the risk of those harmful consequences occurring was not so slight that an ordinary prudent individual would feel justified in treating them as negligible . It is only when this is so that the doer of the act is acting 'recklessly' if, before doing the act, he either fails to give any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or, having recognised that there was such risk, he nevertheless goes on to do it. 

In my view, an appropriate instruction to the jury on what is meant by driving recklessly would be that they must be satisfied of two things: first, that the defendant was in fact driving the vehicle in such a manner as to create an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person who might happen to be using the road or of doing substantial damage to property; and, second, that in driving in that manner the defendant did so without having given any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or, having recognised that there was some risk involved, had none the less gone on to take it. 

It is for the jury to decide whether the risk created by the manner in which the vehicle was being driven was both obvious and serious and, in deciding this, they may apply the standard of the ordinary prudent motorist as represented by themselves. 

If satisfied that an obvious and serious risk was created by the manner of the defendant's driving, the jury are entitled to infer that he was in one or other of the states of mind required to constitute the offence and will probably do so; but regard must be given to any explanation he gives as to his state of mind which may displace the inference. 

21As the Magistrate, who expressly referred to much of the above extract in her judgment, observed, R v Lawrence was referred to with approval by Kirby P (as he then was) in the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Tolmie (1995) 37 NSWLR 660, in the context of considering whether an accused was reckless as to whether the complainant consented to sexual intercourse for the purposes of (NSW) Crimes Act 1900, s 61I; however, this related only to the question of mens rea. Both parties accepted that his Lordship's analysis was applicable to the analogous navigation offences under the Marine Safety Act , and the argument turned on the meaning of what his Lordship said rather than on its applicability, albeit that in the present case this ground of appeal pertains to the actus reus - or 'objective component' - of the offences. 

22For the Authority, Mr Kirk submitted that his Lordship's reference to a ""serious"" risk was a reference not to the likelihood of the risk but to the serious harmful consequences if it materialised. However, his Lordship repeatedly described the relevant consequences as being (any) physical injury to another person, or substantial damage to property, and did so immediately after the reference to ""obvious and serious risk"". If his Lordship had intended the word ""serious"" to characterise the consequences, he would have said 'obvious risk of serious consequences'; the noun 'risk' would not have followed the adjective 'serious'. Accordingly, in my view, his Lordship's reference to 'serious risk' was a reference to the chance or probability of the harmful consequences - the quality of which he otherwise described in terms of personal injury or substantial property damage - resulting, not to their gravity. 

23Mr Kirk invoked his Lordship's references to the possibility that the act was capable of causing the kind of serious harmful consequences that the offence was intended to deter; the risk being not so slight that an ordinary prudent individual could treat them as negligible; and the defendant not having given thought to the possibility of any such risk, to submit that a risk which, if it materialised, would have serious consequences, so long as it was not so negligible that an ordinary prudent person could justifiably ignore it, would satisfy the actus reus of the offence. However, those references were in the context of his Lordship's discussion of mens rea ; and (at least in the last case) explicitly refer back to ""any such risk"" - being an ""obvious and serious risk"". When discussing the actus reus , his Lordship repeatedly referred to a ""real"" and ""obvious and serious"" risk, clearly holding that the risk must be both obvious and serious. Contrary to Mr Kirk's submission, that the possibility not be so negligible that an ordinary person could justifiably ignore it is not an element of the actus reus , but was referred to by his Lordship exclusively in the context of the mens rea . 

24Mr Kirk submitted that the notion of recklessness in this context should involve no higher standard than is required when it is otherwise engaged as a subjective element of an offence, in which context ""the Crown must establish foresight of the possibility of the relevant consequence"" [ Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93, [66]-[82] (Beazley JA, James J agreeing)]. However, as both parties accepted, and as Lord Diplock's speech makes clear, in these particular types of offences the word ""recklessly"" is part of the actus reus as well as being relevant to the mens rea . Consistently with that view, insofar as it addresses the mens rea , Lord Diplock's test does not differ from that described by Beazley JA in Blackwell . And even in the context of mens rea , there is authority that advertence to a real - as distinct from a ""bare"" - possibility is required. Thus in R v Banditt (2004) 151 A Crim R 215; [2004] NSWCCA 208, a sexual assault case, James J said (at [92]): 

... the possibility that the complainant is not consenting, of which the accused is aware, must be more than merely a bare possibility... if an accused person is aware of a real possibility that the complainant does not consent to sexual intercourse, he acts recklessly if, having that knowledge, he decides to proceed to have sexual intercourse, even if he considers it probable (although ex hypothesi not certain) that the complainant does consent... In the kind of extreme case postulated by counsel for the appellant, in which an accused believes that it is overwhelmingly probable that the complainant is consenting but is aware that there is a slight possibility, say a 1% chance, that she is not consenting, then the possibility should be disregarded as being merely a bare possibility and not a real possibility... 

25Moreover, as Lord Diplock explained, the act of driving recklessly involves a manner of driving that incurs not merely the possibility of a risk of the relevant consequences, but of an obvious and serious risk of them. While, as Mr Kirk points out, and I do not think is disputed, there is some overlap in 'recklessness' offences of this kind between the mens rea and actus reus - in the sense, as Lord Diplock explains, that proof of the actus reus invariably goes towards establishing the necessary mens rea - t his does mean that advertence (or inadvertence) to the possibility of 'serious consequences' required to establish mens rea translates to the actus reus: t he mens rea and actus reus remain distinct, albeit overlapping, components of the offence. Whilst mens rea is satisfied (as in other types of recklessness cases) if there is a real (as distinct from bare) possibility of the relevant harmful consequences occurring, the actus reus requires something more - namely, an 'obvious and serious risk' of those consequences. 

26A similar view has been taken in the context of (NSW) Civil Liability Act, s 5K, which defines a 'dangerous recreational activity' as an activity with a significant risk of physical harm ; it has been held that gravity of the potential harm alone does not make a risk significant. In Laoulach v Ibrahim [2011] NSWCA 402, concerning injuries suffered as a result of a diving accident in Botany Bay, Tobias JA said (at [123]): 

In their written submissions the respondents contended that the risk was significant in terms of its catastrophic consequences. In my opinion that is insufficient. For the risk to be found to be significant there must be a finding not only that it was more than trivial or very slight but also, generally speaking, that there was a real chance of the risk materialising. There is difficulty in accepting that that standard was satisfied in the present case given his Honour's finding, not challenged by the respondents, that the probability of the risk of harm materialising was low. 

27In this setting, serious risk means a serious - as opposed to fanciful, very slight or merely theoretical - possibility. Nonetheless, a serious possibility falls well short of something that will probably happen; in R v Buttsworth, O'Brien CJ of CrD (at 684) described the trial judge's explanation that an ""appreciable risk of injury"" was required as ""putting the legal test at least favourably for the accused"". 

28Accordingly, it seems to me that the actus reus of reckless navigation requires that the defendant so operate the vessel as to incur risk (1) that is obvious, (2) the likelihood of which is serious, in the sense that it is a serious and not fanciful, very slight or merely theoretical possibility, and (3) the potential consequences of which involve personal injury or substantial property damage. 

29Mr Kirk submitted that her Honour wrongly focussed on the 'likelihood' element - illustrated by references in the judgment to a 'possibility of danger' and 'potential risk' (as distinct from an obvious risk) - to the exclusion of the gravity of the potential consequences; that this was fundamental to the ultimate finding that a possibility of the consequences of the event occurring could not constitute a ""real, obvious and serious risk""; and that while a remote risk of minimal consequences might not found recklessness, a slight risk of grave consequences would do so. But in my judgment, the requirements that the risk be obvious and serious are independent of the gravity of its consequences: however grave the potential consequences, there will only be recklessness if their materialisation is at least an obvious and serious, as distinct from mere, possibility. 

30That is not to say that the gravity of the potential consequences has no relevance to the question of recklessness. The gravity of the potential consequences is a relevant circumstance to be considered under s 13(3). An ordinary prudent operator could justifiably assume a risk of greater likelihood with minor potential consequences, than one of less likelihood with graver consequences. Thus in R v Buttsworth - an appeal against a conviction for offences of culpable driving occasioning death and grievous bodily harm under (NSW) Crimes Act 1900, s 52A - O'Brien CJ of Cr D (with whom Street CJ and Nagle CJ at CL agreed), said (at 665-666) (emphasis added): 

A layman, therefore, may describe the driving of a motor vehicle or the driver by various degrees of disapprobation for the manner of the handling of a vehicle upon the road. Rarely will he seriously describe the driving as intended to do harm, but he speaks rather of the apparent lack of regard for the harm the driver ought to realize he may cause to people who may be on the road or in its vicinity. His particular criticism of the driving or the driver may, of course, be aroused by or focussed upon the plight of some particular individual who was specifically put in danger by the deficiency of the driving or the driver, but the layman readily uses these expressions of disapprobation of the use of a vehicle upon a road as descriptive of the general lack of concern the driving displays for the safety of others who might be the worse 
for it. He speaks of the risks to others involved in such use of the vehicle, the potential involved of harm to others. Ordinary lay usage describes such a manner of driving, or the driver by epithets such as unsafe, careless, negligent, dangerous, reckless, hazardous, or perilous, perhaps followed by a noun to accentuate the description. The use of these various expressions will 
often be governed by the degree of the risk of harm and the gravity of the harm that is considered to be involved . 

31But there is an irreducible minimum, namely that however grave the potential consequences, the likelihood of the risk materialising must be at least real, obvious and serious. Thus an aircraft pilot assumes the risk of bird strike, with the grave potential consequences of engine failure and crashing, but would not be said to be flying recklessly, unless the circumstances were such that the risk was at least an obvious and serious possibility; for example if he or she proceeded to take off through a flock of seagulls. A vessel operator assumes the risk of striking a submerged object, with the grave potential consequences of the vessel sinking and its passengers drowning, but would not be said to be navigating recklessly, unless in the circumstances the risk was an obvious and serious possibility; for example, if he or she proceeded to sail through a channel in which there were known to be such objects. Once this is appreciated, her Honour's focus on the question of likelihood is unsurprising: undoubtedly, the consequences of the relevant risk in this case - propeller strike - involved personal injury, so that the fundamental question was whether it was an obvious and serious possibility. The circumstance that the risk existed and had those potential consequences was insufficient to render the operation of the vessel reckless - unless the risk was obvious and its likelihood a serious possibility. In my view, therefore, her Honour was right to insist that more than a mere possibility, but a ""real"" and ""obvious and serious"" risk, of propeller strike was required to establish the actus reus of recklessness for the purposes of s 13(1)(b). 

32Although this ground of appeal was mainly concerned with recklessness, it also referred to negligence. Her Honour rightly identified (at [18] and [31]) that, to establish negligent operation, it was unnecessary that the defendant recognise the risk. The Authority's case was that the mere incurring of a risk - at least one that has potentially grave consequences - renders conduct relevantly negligent. While the content of the offence of negligent navigation is analysed under the second ground below, this contention can be disposed of here. 

33The mere presence, or foreseeability, of a risk - however grave its potential consequences - does not make a case of negligence. Negligence involves the unreasonable incurring of risk, and in this context reasonableness is usually, if not always, influenced by the likelihood of materialisation of the risk. Men and women of ordinary prudence run risks - even risks that have potentially grave consequences - every day, upon assessing their likelihood as remote, and/or their incurring as being outweighed by other benefits. Negligence no more than recklessness can be established by the mere incurring of a risk with potentially grave consequences. 

34Although not directly on point, this is illustrated by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in RTA v Graincorp Operations Ltd [2010] NSWCA 317, where t he relevant section relevantly provided: 

A person who is a consignee of goods consigned for road transport is guilty of an offence if: 

(a) the person engages in conduct, and 

(b) that conduct results or is likely to result in inducing or rewarding a breach of a relevant mass ... requirement, and 

(c) the person is negligent as to the matter mentioned in para (b). 


35Mr Odgers, who appeared in that case for the RTA, had submitted that it was not an element of the offence that the conduct be characterised as negligent, and that all that was required was that the foreseeability of the conduct would have been sufficient to alert a reasonable consignee that its conduct would be likely to induce a breach, the test being an objective one. Mr Stevenson, for Graincorp, submitted that foreseeability was only the starting point, and it remained necessary to prove negligence of the defendant to the criminal standard and not just rely on whether or not the outcome of the conduct was foreseeable: there was a duty imposed by statute, and it was essential to establish a breach of that duty. 

36Handley AJA said (at [ 72]): 

The subsection does not penalise the consignee's failure to achieve the foresight of a reasonable person, it penalises conduct that is negligent. In doing so it imposes a statutory duty on a consignee to take reasonable care to avoid conduct which it should foresee will have or be likely to have the consequences referred to. 

37Giles JA said (at [ 16]): 

For the reasons given by Handley AJA, it was not sufficient that it be foreseeable that receipt of loads after a first receipt of an overloaded vehicle was likely to result in inducing a breach of a relevant mass requirement. Negligence in receiving the loads had to be established. The Magistrate was not satisfied that it had been established. 

38The first ground of appeal therefore fails. 

Ground 2 - the content of criminally negligent navigation 

39The Authority's second ground of appeal is that the Magistrate erred in holding that contravention of s 13(1)(a) required a high and significantly culpable degree of negligence, being a higher degree of negligence than the standard applicable under civil law. 

40The essence of her Honour's relevant reasoning was as follows: 

(1)Criminal negligence (for the purposes of s 13(1)(a)) is a different concept from and ought not be conflated with common law negligence (in the civil context); it involves placing other users at risk regardless of whether they are there; it is a criminally culpable degree of carelessness and there is no need for a defendant to recognise the risk, nor for any damage to be suffered; it involves a higher degree of negligence than in civil negligence cases, namely, acting without due care to a criminal grade (at [18]) [citing R v Buttsworth [1983] 1 NSWLR 658]. 

(2)There was insufficient evidence to answer, beyond reasonable doubt, whether this instance of propeller strike was a horrific and remarkable incident or ""a real risk, something to be expected"" (at [27]). The evidence did not enable the Court to distinguish between whether the activity was inherently risky and therefore reckless or criminally negligent, or simply a freak occurrence, an accident (at [28]). 

(3)While negligence did not require recognition of risk, it required a criminally culpable degree of carelessness, a departure from the standard of care expected of the ordinary prudent operator. The defendant told the officer cadets where to sit, how and where to hang on, and to lean in the opposite direction; they had earlier been warned about the propeller; he gave them warning in advance of each turn and the direction it would take. While the defendant's manner of operating the vessel caused them to fall overboard, it did not depart from that expected standard of care and was not criminally negligent (at [31]). 

41The Authority contends that her Honour, by emphasising a requirement for a ""criminally culpable degree of carelessness"", by stating that Buttsworth emphasised that a higher degree of negligence was required than in civil cases, and in referring to acting without due care to a criminal grade, wrongly required a considerable degree of departure from the standard of care to be expected of an ordinarily prudent operator, and thereby required the prosecution to establish a greater degree of departure from the requisite standard of care than the law required. In a sense, t he issue posed for determination is whether the degree of negligence encapsulated by s 13(1)(a) is of the same or different level to that prescribed under the civil law; however, the cases emphasise that the two are different concepts and it is preferable simply to articulate the test for ""criminal"" negligence in this context rather than to compare it to the civil test. 

42As Mr Kirk acknowledged, there is no doubt that criminal negligence and civil negligence are distinct concepts. Their conceptual distinctness, and the recognition of differing degrees of criminal negligence was elucidated by Lord Hewart in R v Bateman (1927) 19 Cr App R 8 (at 11-12), a medical manslaughter case: 

In the civil action, if it is proved that A. fell short of the standard of reasonable care required by law, it matters not how far he fell short of that standard. The extent of his liability depends not on the degree of negligence, but on the amount of damage done. In a criminal Court, on the contrary, the amount and degree of negligence are the determining question. ... 

... 

In explaining to juries the test which they should apply to determine whether the negligence, in the particular case, amounted or did not amount to a crime, judges have used many epithets, such as ""culpable"", ""criminal"", ""gross"", ""wicked"", ""clear"", ""complete"". But, whatever epithet be used and whether an epithet be used or not, in order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment. 

43In Andrews v Director of Public Prosecutions [1937] AC 576, a motor manslaughter case, Lord Atkin, having cited the above passages, said (at 583): 

The principle to be observed is that cases of manslaughter in driving motor cars are but instances of a general rule applicable to all charges of homicide by negligence. Simple lack of care such as will constitute civil liability is not enough : for the purposes of the criminal law there are degrees of negligence : and a very high degree of negligence is required to be proved before the felony is established . Probably of all the epithets that can be applied ""reckless"" most nearly covers the case. 

... 

If the principle of Bateman's case (19 Cr. App. R. 8) is observed it will appear that the law of manslaughter has not changed by the introduction of motor vehicles on the road. Death caused by their negligent driving, though unhappily much more frequent, is to be treated in law as death caused by any other form of negligence : and juries should be directed accordingly. 

44In Callaghan v The Queen (1952) 87 CLR 115, in considering the degree of negligence required for the purposes of the separate offences of manslaughter and failure to use reasonable care and not take reasonable precautions occasioning death under (WA) Criminal Code 1913-1945, s 291A, the High Court said (at 121): 

But the question then arises what is the standard of negligence required... The words ""use reasonable care and take reasonable precautions"" smack very much of the civil standard of negligence ; yet, particularly of late, defaults involving no moral blame at all are treated as exposing the party to civil liability for negligence in respect of any damage which results... 

... 

The question obviously is one of difficulty but in the end it appears to depend upon a choice between two courses. One is to treat the omission to perform the duty to use reasonable care and take reasonable precautions as a description of negligent conduct to be applied according to a single and unvarying standard. The other is to recognize that it may have different applications when it is a description of fault so blameworthy as to be punishable as a crime... 

45Significantly, the Court stated (at 124): 

The conclusion we have formed is that the expression ""omission to perform the duty to use reasonable care and take reasonable precautions"" which in effect is that of s. 266 and s. 291A must be regarded from the point of view of the context where it occurs. It is in a criminal code dealing with major crimes involving grave moral guilt ... we think it would be wrong to suppose that it was intended by the Code to make the degree of negligence punishable as manslaughter so low as the standard of fault sufficient to give rise to civil liability. The standard set both by s. 266 and s. 291A should, in our opinion, be regarded as that set by the common law in cases where negligence amounts to manslaughter. 

46All these were manslaughter cases, not cases in which the offence was driving (or operating) a vehicle (or vessel) negligently. 

47In RTA v Graincorp Operations Ltd , Handley AJA (with whom Giles and McColl JJA agreed) said that negligent conduct penalised by the criminal law must involve such a marked departure from the relevant standard of care as to merit criminal punishment. Handley AJA observed, relevantly: 

[68] ... Negligence is a term of art in the criminal and civil law and its prima facie technical meaning is conduct, by act or omission, which falls short of a duty of care imposed by law on the person concerned. It describes conduct measured against an objective standard and not a state of mind. 

[69] Negligence criminalised by statute would ordinarily be conduct in breach of a duty of care recognized by the general law, or created by statute. 

... 

[75] Negligent conduct penalised by the criminal law must evidence such a marked departure from the standard of care, that a reasonable man would have exercised, that it merits criminal punishment... 

48However, that case concerned a prosecution of a consignee for criminal negligence in engaging in conduct the result of which was the overloading of trucks. The relevant section imposed criminal liability on consignees of goods consigned by road transport in overloaded vehicles. A consignee committed the offence if: 

(a) the person engages in conduct, and 

(b) that results or is likely to result in inducing or rewarding a breach of the relevant mass ... requirement, and 

(c) the person is negligent as to the matter mentioned in paragraph (b). 


49In support of the view that ""such a marked departure ... that it merits criminal punishment"" was required, his Honour referred to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in NSW Sugar Milling Co-Operative Ltd v Environmental Protection Authority (1992) 59 A Crim R 6, which involved a prosecution for an offence under s 6(1) of the (NSW) Environmental Offences & Penalties Act 1989 which made it an offence for a person wilfully or negligently to cause any substance to escape in a manner that was likely to harm the environment. Hunt CJ at CL said (at 7): 

The appellant's principal submission ... was that Mr Watts ... was not negligent because of the actions which he took and the conclusions which he drew complied with the duty of care which the law placed on him ... 

In considering whether any defendant has acted negligently, the issue is decided upon an objective basis. What must be considered is whether the risk of such harm was foreseeable to the reasonable person in the position of the defendant, not whether the defendant subjectively foresaw the risk himself ... the criminal law has ... adopted an objective test ... 

... the evidence discloses that, objectively, a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would have foreseen the likelihood of harm to the environment, and that negligence was established in accordance with the criminal standard discussed in Andrews v DPP [1937] AC 576, 583. 


50Enderby J said (at 11): 

Negligence is not a subjective test but an objective test. It is the standard of the objective or hypothetical reasonable man. Negligence is the failure to reach the objective standard of the reasonable person. It does not involve an enquiry into the subjective thinking of the person who is said to have been negligent ... It is a matter of judgment for the Judge. 

Foreseeability is an essential part of the concept of negligence and it too is an objective question. 


51Allen J said (at 12): 

... it is to be borne in mind that the appellant, the body convicted, was not Mr Watts but the co-operative. The question is whether that body fell so short of the standard of care of the objectively reasonable person in the position in which it found itself that it was negligent to the criminal degree. 


52In Graincorp, Handley AJA concluded (at [79]): 

In my judgment therefore Clisdell LCM did not fall into legal error in directing himself that the RTA had to prove, to the criminal standard, that GC was guilty of criminal negligence nor did Hall J when he dismissed this part of the RTA's appeal. 


53Neither RTA v Graincorp, nor NSW Sugar Milling v EPA , were cases of, or analogous to, the offence of negligent driving. In both, negligence was a state of mind to be proved by the prosecution, as to certain consequences - inducing or rewarding overloading, or causing an environmentally harmful substance to escape. Hunt CJ at CL's reference to Andrews v DPP reveals that, in both these cases, involving as they did negligence as a state of mind, the ""criminal"" concept of negligence applied in manslaughter - where it is also a state of mind - was thought applicable. As will be further explained below, these cases do not govern the offence of driving negligently and its analogues, where ""negligent driving"" describes the conduct penalised, and constitutes the actus reus . 

54In Clout v Hutchison (1950) 51 SR (NSW) 32, the defendant - who had been acquitted by a jury of negligent driving causing grievous bodily harm under (NSW) Crimes Act 1900, s 54 - was then charged with an offence against (NSW) Motor Traffic Act 1909, s 4, which provided that anyone who drove a motor vehicle on a public street ""negligently, furiously, or recklessly"" was guilty of an offence. Mr E G Whitlam, who appeared for the defendant, raised a plea of issue estoppel, arguing that as the jury had not accepted that the evidence established the offence of negligence occasioning grievous bodily harm, the prosecutor was estopped from bringing a charge of negligent driving. Mr Whitlam argued that it was unsatisfactory to take mere carelessness, such as would suffice to establish liability in tort, as the test under s 4 of the Motor Traffic Act, under which a person might be guilty of negligence although no other person is affected by it. 

55Sir Kenneth Whistler Street CJ rejected the plea of 'issue estoppel', saying (at 35) (emphasis added): 

... I think, however, that the Legislature has evinced a clear intention to distinguish between driving which was merely regarded as negligent and driving which came within the other categories of offences dealt with in s. 4. By s. 10 provision is made for the penalties which may be imposed for offences under the Motor Traffic Act and the court before whom any person is convicted of such an offence is given power to suspend the offender's licence. By sub-s. (3A) a suspension follows automatically for any conviction under s. 4, except a conviction for negligent driving, and this makes clear the legislative intent that negligent driving was regarded as something less serious than reckless or furious driving, and suggests that the high degree of negligence which must be proved in order to justify a conviction under s. 54 of the Crimes Act, need not be proved in order to justify a conviction under s. 4 ... 

56After referring to Wintulich v Lenthall [1932] SASR 60 and Waugh v Campbell [1920] SC (J) 1 as authorities to the effect that this offence could be constituted by negligence ""falling short of gross negligence of the type to which I have already referred and which it was necessary to prove in order to justify a conviction on a criminal charge "", his Honour continued (at 35-36): 

I am of the opinion, therefore, that the negligence which it is necessary to prove in order to constitute the offence of negligent driving within the meaning of s. 4... is a different and lesser degree of negligence than that which it is necessary to prove in order to establish an offence under s. 54 of the Crimes Act . It results from this that a jury would be entitled to acquit on an indictment charging an offence under the section of the Crimes Act , but the evidence might yet be amply sufficient to establish an offence under s. 4 of the Motor Traffic Act, and in those circumstances, an acquittal on the more serious charge cannot be used to raise an ""issue estoppel"" when summary proceedings are instituted against the same accused out of the same set of facts and circumstances. 

57The Chief Justice thus postulated degrees of negligence in criminal law. The different statutory context of the Motor Traffic Act as distinct from the Crimes Act resulted in the offence under the former involving a lesser degree of negligence than the similarly worded offence under the latter. The offence under the former of driving negligently was concerned with ""driving which was merely negligent"", and did not involve negligence of the degree ""which it was necessary to prove in order to justify a conviction on a criminal charge"". 

58In R v Buttsworth , O'Brien CJ of Cr D (with whom Street CJ and Nagle CJ at CL agreed), undertook a comprehensive examination of the evolution of driving offences, beginning with (NSW) Motor Traffic Act 1909, which was sourced from (UK) Motor Car Act (3 Edw VII c 36). His Honour observed (at 664) that the criminal law had intervened to insist that drivers observe a duty to drive in a manner that avoided unnecessary risk of causing harm to other road users, by imposing criminal sanctions for breaches of such duty. His Honour continued (at 664-665): 

As the quality of the driving was to attract a penal sanction it became necessary to recognize that the sanction should bear some proportion to the conduct regarded as warranting a penal sanction. Since what was to be punished was a neglect of duty it followed that the primary distinction must be found in the culpability of the neglect. There must be degrees of negligence with the offences and penalties adjusted accordingly. They need not necessarily require that harm should be caused by the negligence or be associated with the offence but since the criminal law often looks to the harm caused as a measure of the offence done the imposition of a penal sanction may relate both to the degree of negligence and to the harm associated with it. 

59His Honour then referred to conceptual differences between the criminal offence of negligent driving and the common law tort (at 666): 

The common law was never adapted to these concepts. Negligence was long recognized in the civil law as an action on the case where there was a duty of care by one for the safety of another, a breach of that duty and injury resulting from that breach giving a right of damages for the injury. It had no other meaning and there was only one standard of care breach of which was negligence, namely, that of the ordinary reasonable man in the circumstances. In the history of penal sanctions for the driving of a motor vehicle upon a public road without proper regard for the safety of others this concept of the civil law has been a frequent problem for lawyers whose familiarity with negligence has been with the action on the case. 

Lawyers are so familiar with this use of the term negligence as a description of a tort, so commonly the cause of action in claims for damages, that it tends to overshadow the lay use of the term which is a less technical expression especially when applied to the driving of a motor vehicle upon a public road. 

When a layman speaks of having seen a vehicle being driven negligently on the road, or of having seen some negligent driving or describes a driver he has seen upon the road as being negligent he does not have in mind an action on the case but rather of the manner in which a vehicle was managed upon the road, whether or not an accident or injury has resulted therefrom and whether or not any particular person has been put in peril. He may, of course, describe the driving by other epithets but in all such cases he takes into account the general circumstances of the occasion, the kind of vehicle in question, the apparent condition of the vehicle and the task which the vehicle is performing such as the carrying of an overhanging or inadequately secured load. 

60Thus his Honour drew a distinction between an action on the case of which damage to a person to whom a duty of care is owed is an essential element, and criminal negligence which relates to the manner of driving. His Honour referred to the 1909 Act, which made it an offence to drive ""negligently, furiously, or recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public"", and observed that the driving legislation made merely driving negligently, without occasioning damage, an offence (at 667): 

This provision was taken from s 1 of the UK Motor Car Act , 1903 (3 Edw VII c 36), and originally drew no distinction between driving ""negligently"" or ""recklessly"" or in ""a manner dangerous to the public"" so far as the gravity of the offence was concerned. In each case the court was required to have regard to matters to which regard would be had at civil law in considering whether a cause of action in negligence had been made out by a person claiming compensation for injury so sustained. All these offences were devised for the protection of other users of the roads and each offence was committed only when the safety of others who were using or might reasonably be expected to be using the road was put at risk. Nevertheless a legislative intention to establish the concept that it was a criminal offence to drive simply in a manner which was negligent for the safety of the public as the other users of the road according to the standard of the civil law and yet 
involving no injury was frequently denied. As Street CJ pointed out in Clout v Hutchinson (1950) 51 SR (NSW) 32, at 35; 67 WN 203, at 204, the authorities usually referred to as affirming that intention were the decision of the High Court of Justiciary in Scotland in Waugh v Campbell 1920 SC (J) 1, upon the Motor Car Act , 1903 (UK) and that of Murray CJ in the Supreme Court of South Australia in Wintulich v Lenthall [1932] SASR 60 which followed the Scottish case and was in turn followed by Napier J, as he then was, in Neale v Walsh [1932] SASR 429. 

61His Honour then turned to the judgment of Murray CJ in Wintulich v Lenthall [1932] SASR 60, an appeal from a conviction for having driven a motor car negligently. As O'Brien CJ explained, Murray CJ rejected the appellant's submissions that a person cannot be so convicted unless it be shown firstly that he drove in a manner that was dangerous to the public and secondly, that the negligence must be wilful or intentional. His Honour observed that what was declared to be unlawful was driving ""negligently"", not with ""gross"" or ""culpable"" negligence, and concluded that ""to drive 'negligently' without more is, therefore, made an offence"", elaborating (at 63): 

There can be no doubt that this involves a substantial alteration of the common law, for negligence by itself has hitherto had no legal consequences. In the civil law it must have caused damage to the person or property of another before it will give ground for an action ... Now the statute attaches penal consequences to the negligent driving of a motor vehicle, although no person may have been injured, nor any property damaged. 

62Murray CJ then explained that the statute was not a serious inroad into the rights of citizens, in a passage that throws light on the content of the offence: 

To shew this it is only necessary to point out what negligence at common law consists in. Negligence is the breach of a legal duty to take care, and the duty imposed by the law on persons who drive vehicles on a public road is that they shall manage them with the same degree of care as an ordinary prudent man would deem necessary in the circumstances presented to him, in order to avoid injuring or causing damage to the person or property of others who may be using the road. The standard, it will be noted, is not that of the exceptionally careful man, nor is it that which the actual driver may consider to be sufficient, but the standard of the average man who has regard for the safety and the rights of others. The duty is reciprocal, and, therefore, the burden lies equally on each for the benefit of all. 

63This suggests a close analogy between the concept of negligence at common law, and the offence of negligent driving. His Honour added (at 63-4): 

The answer to the contention, then, is, that the statute does not 
expressly provide that the negligence shall be gross or culpable, or that it shall be dangerous to the public; but, as there is implied in the negligent driving of a vehicle upon a highway a departure from a standard of care which is imposed for the safety of other persons and their property on the highway, it may from that point of view be true to say that the conduct prohibited is conduct which is dangerous to the public. But danger to the public is not a special circumstance to be proved. It is enough to shew that there was negligence. 

64I see nothing in Wintulich v Lenthall that indicates that the standard of care contemplated by the offence of negligent driving is relevantly different from that contemplated by the common law tort, or that any greater a departure from it is required to establish negligence. 

65O'Brien CJ then explained (at 669) the emergence of statutory provisions differentiating between degrees of negligence, commencing with the (UK) Road Traffic Act 1930, in which s 11(1) penalised driving recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public; while s 12(1) penalised the lower degree of driving without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road. As his Honour explained (at 670): 

Thus a distinction was drawn by the statute of 1930 between driving negligently and driving in a manner dangerous to the public which was regarded as a distinction in the degree by which the manner of driving departed from the standard of care which would be shown by an ordinary prudent man in the circumstances in order to avoid injury to others who may be using the road. It was the public, that is to say, the people who are using or may reasonably be expected to be using the public road, that the statute sought to protect and it did so by penalizing the offending driver according to the degree of his neglect for their safety. 

66His Honour then turned (at 670) to motor manslaughter . In the course of this discussion (at 670-671) his Honour set out the extracts from the speeches of Lord Hewart in R v Bateman and of Lord Atkin in Andrews v DPP referred to above. Then (at 672) his Honour turned to what Lord Atkin had said on the topic of negligent driving outside the context of manslaughter. Like O'Brien CJ, I consider the passage, and O'Brien CJ's discussion of it, so important as to justify its reproduction: 

Lord Atkin then turned to the Road Traffic Acts and though this passage is substantial it is necessary that I should quote it (at 584, 585): 
""Those Acts have provisions which regulate the degree of care to be taken in driving motor vehicles . They have no direct reference to causing death by negligence. Their prohibitions, while directed no doubt to cases of negligent driving, which if death be caused would justify convictions for manslaughter, extend to degrees of negligence of less gravity. Sect. 12 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, imposes a penalty for driving without care and attention. This would apparently cover all degrees of negligence. Sect. 11 imposes a penalty for driving recklessly or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public. There can be no doubt that this section covers driving with such a high degree of negligence as that if death were caused the offender would have committed manslaughter. But the converse is not true, and it is perfectly possible that a man may drive at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public and cause death and yet not be guilty of manslaughter: and the Legislature appears to recognize this by the provision in s 34 of the Road Traffic Act, 1934, that on an indictment for manslaughter a man may be convicted of dangerous driving. But, apart altogether from any inference to be drawn from s 34, I entertain no doubt that the statutory offence of dangerous driving may be committed, though the negligence is not of such a degree as would amount to manslaughter if death ensued. 

... 

I cannot think of anything worse for users of the road than the conception that no one could be convicted of dangerous driving unless his negligence was so great that if he had caused death he must have been convicted of manslaughter. It therefore would appear that in directing the jury in a case of manslaughter the judge should in the first instance charge them substantially in accordance with the general law, that is, requiring the high degree of negligence indicated in Bateman's case (19 Cr.App.R. 8) and then explain that such degree of negligence is not necessarily the same as that which is required for the offence of dangerous driving, and then indicate to them the conditions under which they might acquit of manslaughter and convict of dangerous driving."" 

The emphasis, of course, is mine. It is, I think, plain from this passage in the speech of Lord Atkin that he draws a distinction between driving negligently, driving in a manner dangerous to the public and driving of a kind which justifies a conviction for manslaughter as essentially a distinction in the degree of negligence appropriate to the offence, a distinction in the degree of departure from the standard of care for other users of the road to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver in the circumstances. 

The speech of Lord Atkin in Andrews v Director of Public Prosecutions remains the authority in New South Wales for the propositions his Lordship expounds and the distinctions he draws remain, I think, valid in this State. In particular I think his proposition remains valid that the distinction between driving in a manner dangerous to the public and driving recklessly so as to amount to manslaughter if death ensues is a distinction in the degree of negligence involved. 


67The UK offence of driving ""without due care and attention"" - which Lord Atkin said "" would apparently cover all degrees of negligence"" - corresponds to the New South Wales offence of driving negligently. 

68Later, O'Brien CJ acknowledged the conceptual distinction between negligence in the criminal and civil contexts (at 677): 

Negligence in the criminal sense is thus a different concept from negligence in civil law. Burbury CJ in Fehlberg v Gallahar [1957] TasLR 286, preferred the word ""carelessness"". 


69Fehlberg v Gallahar [1957] TasLR 286 concerned an offence under the (TAS) Traffic Act 1925, s 32(2), of ""driving a motor vehicle on a public street negligently"". After quoting Lord Atkin's reference to the differing degrees of negligence in the statutory offences and in manslaughter, Burbury CJ said (at 288-9): 

Section 32 itself recognises different degrees of negligence. Reckless driving and dangerous driving import higher degrees of negligence than negligent driving simpliciter . The recognition by the legislature of degrees of negligence in driving motor vehicles is made even clearer by s 32 as amended by the Traffic Act 1957. The section as so amended prescribes a higher punishment for reckless and dangerous driving than for negligent driving. (See s 32(1) and (2).) Counsel for the respondent submitted that it was sufficient for the prosecution to prove negligence as low as the standard of fault sufficient to give rise to civil liability. But the negligence referred to in s 32 is not the same as common law negligence giving rise to an action for damages. At common law negligence is the breach of a duty to take care. 'The ideas of negligence and duty are strictly correlative and there is no such thing as negligence in the abstract, negligence is simply 
neglect of some care which we are bound by law to exercise towards somebody,' (per Bowen L.J. in Thomas v. Quartermaine (1887) 18 Q.B.D. 685, at p. 694), and it is of course essential that the negligent conduct should cause harm. For the purpose of negligence in this sense there are no degrees of negligence ( Charlesworth on Negligence, 3 rd edn. p. 5). The standard is that of a reasonable man and the degree of care to be exercised is determined according to the circumstances. But 'negligently' in s. 32 is used only in the sense of 'carelessly'. It is a mistake to attempt to equate the negligence referred to in s. 32 to negligence at common law. They are different concepts. 'Criminal and 
civil liability are two separate things' (per Lord Porter in Potts or Riddell v. Reid [1943] A.C. 1, at p. 31). The enquiry is whether having regard to the matters mentioned in s. 32, the tribunal of fact is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has driven carelessly, that is, without due care."" 

70Notably, Burbury CJ - having said that ""driving negligently"" in s 32 simply meant ""driving carelessly"" - saw no reason to draw any distinction between the offence in the (UK) Road Traffic Act , 1930, of ""driving without due care and attention"" and the offence of ""driving negligently"" in the (TAS) Traffic Act 1925. His Honour also expressed agreement with the reasoning in Wintulich v Lenthall and Clout v Hutchinson . Thus, while emphasising that the criminal offence of negligent driving and the civil tort were different concepts, not to be equated, nonetheless his Honour identified the applicable standard of care for the former as that of a reasonable man; said that the degree of care to be exercised was to be determined according to the circumstances; held that 'negligently' meant 'carelessly'; and thought the offence indistinguishable from the UK offence of driving without due care and attention, which Lord Atkin supposed to catch all degrees of negligence. All this indicates that while there are important differences - including that no breach of duty to another resulting in damage is required, and that the breach must be proved beyond reasonable doubt - the applicable standard of care and departure from it to constitute the offence accords closely with the standard and departure required to establish breach of duty at common law. It certainly does not suggest that some higher degree of negligence is required before the offence can be committed. 

71Buttsworth, and the cases to which it refers, therefore establish that civil and criminal negligence are distinct concepts, and that in the context of motor vehicle and analogous offences there is a hierarchy of degrees of criminal negligence, ranging from that required for manslaughter, through dangerous (sometimes called culpable) driving, to recklessness and then to 'mere' negligence. But while recognising that the concepts are different in some respects, neither Buttsworth nor the other cases mentioned in it hold that the degree of departure from the standard of care of a reasonably careful driver required to establish the offence of driving negligently is any different from that required to establish civil negligence. To the contrary, it appears to support the view that, at least in certain statutory contexts, the offence of negligent driving may be constituted by driving without that care for the safety and rights of others that an average driver would exercise - commensurate to the civil standard. This also accords with the varying degrees of the traffic offences: negligence is lower on the scale than recklessness. 

72More recently, in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Yeo (2008) 188 A Crim R 82; [2008] NSWSC 953 , Johnson J has said (emphasis added): 

[27] Negligent driving is established when it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person drove a motor vehicle in a manner involving a departure from the standard of care for other users of the road to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver in the circumstances . The distinction which may be drawn between driving negligently, driving in a manner dangerous to the public and driving of a kind which justifies a conviction for manslaughter is essentially a distinction in the degree of negligence appropriate to the offence, being a distinction in the degree of departure from the standard of care for other users of the road to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver in the circumstances: R v Buttsworth at 672. 

... 

[29] The question is essentially whether the driver was exercising that degree of care which the ordinary prudent driver would exercise in all the circumstances , including the circumstances as set out in s 42(3): Simpson v Peat [1952] 2 QB 24. 

... 

[32] It is clear that negligent driving is to be regarded as something less serious than reckless or furious driving or driving at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public (all offences contained in s 42(2) of the Act): Clout v Hutchinson at 35. In Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling [1969] 1 NSWR 231 at 241, Asprey JA observed: 

Like the tort of negligence, 'negligent driving' is difficult to reduce to a set of rules. It covers a multitude of sins. It relates to the circumstances of the occasion. What would constitute the offence in one instance would pass without censure in another. 


73The authorities make plain that it is erroneous to conflate criminal and civil negligence, and that they ought to be treated individually as separate concepts. Yeo elucidates that the criminal concept is simply one of a departure from the standard of care for other road users to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver (or operator). There is nothing in the authorities to suggest that driving (or operating) negligently involves anything more than that. This test closely accords with Lord Atkin's statement that ""driving without care and attention"" apparently covers all degrees of negligence; with Street CJ's acceptance that it was concerned with ""driving which was merely negligent"" and did not involve negligence of the degree ""which it was necessary to prove in order to justify a conviction on a criminal charge""; with Murray CJ's explanation of the offence as involving the breach of a duty imposed by the law on persons who drive vehicles on a public road to manage them with the same degree of care as an ordinary prudent man would deem necessary in the circumstances presented to him, in order to avoid injuring or causing damage to the person or property of others who may be using the road; and with Burbury CJ's statement that the enquiry is whether having regard to the matters mentioned in the section, the tribunal of fact is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has driven carelessly, that is, without due care. 

74Returning then to her Honour's judgment, her Honour rightly identified the applicable standard when referring (at [31]) to ""a departure from the standard of care expected of the ordinary prudent operator"". Her Honour was not wrong to state (at [18]) that criminal negligence was different from and ought not be conflated with common law negligence, and that the former involved placing other users at risk ""regardless of whether they are there"", and that it was unnecessary that the defendant recognise the risk, or for any damage to be suffered. But her Honour referred twice (at [18], and again at [31]) to the offence requiring ""a criminally culpable degree of carelessness"", and also (at [19]) to its requiring a ""higher degree of negligence ... than under the civil law"", and ""acting without due care to a criminal grade "". Significantly, her Honour said that in Buttsworth the Court ""emphasised that a higher degree of negligence was required in criminal cases than under civil law, that it involves acting without due care to a criminal grade"". Her Honour's written judgment (though not the transcript of it) attributes this to p 671 of the report; in any event, that is the only page where Buttsworth contains any such statement. But that was Lord Atkin's statement in Andrews on the topic of motor manslaughter, which it will now be apparent has no bearing on the offence of negligent driving or navigation. Her Honour also referred (at [19]) to Yeo , but only for the proposition that negligent driving was something less serious than reckless, furious or dangerous driving. 

75Although I do not conceive that her Honour thought the manslaughter test applicable - indeed the submissions of counsel for the defendant before her expressly disavowed any suggestion that it did - I am nonetheless compelled to conclude that her Honour misdirected herself in this respect. The test which underpinned her Honour's approach at least required ""criminally culpable negligence"", which goes beyond the requirements of the offence, and insisted upon a higher degree of negligence than would be required to establish breach of duty in a civil case; her Honour's reliance on the passage in Buttsworth for this purpose was misconceived. Her Honour should have asked only whether there was a departure from the standard of care for others (including the officer cadets) to be expected of the ordinary prudent operator in all the circumstances. 

76The second ground of appeal is therefore made out. The circumstances in which her Honour came to make this error, however, will require further consideration when I come to the disposal of the appeal. 

Ground 3 - voluntary recreational participation 

77The Authority's third ground of appeal is that the Magistrate erred in treating the facts that the officer cadets who participated in the relevant boat rides did so for fun and willingly as exculpatory for the purposes of s 13(1)(a) and s 13(1)(b). 

78The Magistrate referred (at [22]) to evidence of six officer cadets who had fallen overboard before Officer Cadets Minchin and Mason as all speaking of an activity that was ""simply a bit of fun, an adrenalin rush to see if you could hold on and avoid falling overboard""; that one participant, Officer Cadet King, who had fallen out on an earlier ride, returned for another and fell overboard in the same boatload as Officer Cadet Minchin; and that Petty Officer Rofe and/or Chief Petty Officer McClellan had made comments to the effect that previous participants had enjoyed the experience. Her Honour's conclusions included (at [29]) that officer cadets were clearly going to fall overboard as the boat turned sharply, the challenge of holding on providing the 'fun' or 'adrenalin rush' of the activity. 

79The Authority contends that the Magistrate erred in treating the 'joyride' nature of the activity, and fact that the officer cadets were voluntary participants in it for essentially recreational purposes, as exculpatory. There are two elements to this: first, did her Honour treat those matters as exculpatory; and secondly, would it be erroneous to do so. 

80As to the first, I do not accept that Her Honour treated the voluntary participation of the officer cadets in this activity for fun and excitement as exculpatory. The reference to the cadets conceiving the activity to be ""a bit of fun"" and ""an adrenalin rush"" to see if they ""could hold on and avoid falling overboard"" occurs at paragraph [22] of the judgment, where her Honour is dealing with the prosecution's contention that falling from the vessel was an obvious danger. Read in context, her Honour referred to this evidence in the course of addressing a prosecution submission that there was an obvious danger of participants falling overboard, and did so to confirm the prosecutor's case that there was an obvious risk of this - before (at [23]) rejecting the contention that that of itself involved an obvious and serious risk of personal injury, drawing the distinction between being thrown from a car onto asphalt and being thrown from a boat into water - the former being obviously more dangerous - and deploying as an illustration that because of the different surface, certain risky activities such as water-skiing and donut riding are permissible on water but not on roads. This was to answer the prosecution case that an obvious and serious risk of falling overboard was enough to make the conduct reckless, and to emphasise that the relevant risk (of personal injury) was not of simply falling overboard into the water, but of propeller strike. 

81That this evidence was used by her Honour to distinguish between merely falling overboard, and falling overboard and connecting with the propeller, is emphasised by the conclusion (at [29]) that ""Clearly cadets were going to fall overboard"" during the activity, and that this was the ""fun"" or ""adrenalin rush"" of the activity. This had no bearing on her Honour's conclusion that she was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the risk of personal injury from propeller strike was not an ""obvious and serious"" possibility. 

82It is therefore unnecessary to decide whether it would have been erroneous to treat that matter as exculpatory. But, criminal and civil negligence being conceptually distinct, it would be erroneous to engage tortious defences such as voluntary assumption of risk when assessing whether a criminal charge of recklessness or negligence has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Charges under s 13(1), like charges under motor vehicle legislation, do not require that persons be injured, and do not give rights to injured persons. They concern the conduct of the defendant. As Mr Kirk forcefully argued, such offences attempt to regulate conduct by prohibiting the negligent driving of motor vehicles and operation of water-borne vessels, and the regulatory and deterrent objects of the Act would be undermined if a defendant could evade criminal censure merely because an occupant of a vehicle or vessel who suffered grievous bodily harm or death had agreed to partake in an activity in which the defendant was criminally negligent or reckless. 

83Nonetheless, section 13(3) requires that in considering whether an offence has been committed under the section, the court is to have regard to ""all the circumstances of the case"", and in my view informed voluntary participation in an activity that carries obvious risk to the participants may be a relevant circumstance in a case such as the present where the relevant risk is only to those participants. (NSW) Civil Liability Act, s 5L, provides that a person is not liable in negligence for harm suffered by another as a result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity engaged in by that other, whether or not aware of the risk. Section 5L reflects a social policy that there is utility in enabling those who provide services for others who voluntarily engage in dangerous recreational activities to do so free of the threat of being held negligent if an obvious risk of the activity materialises and causes injury to a participant. While that section is concerned only with civil liability for negligence, it would be a curious result if a defendant remained criminally liable for conduct in respect of which he or she was exonerated from civil liability by it. 

84As the prosecutor argued before the Magistrate, the voluntary participation of a passenger in an illegal joyride in a motor vehicle at high speed would not exculpate the driver, but that is essentially because there are typically other potential victims of negligent driving on public roads than a consensual passenger; moreover it is not a lawful recreational activity. The position would, I venture, be otherwise in the case of an authorised motor race. Much moreso than roads, waterways are commonly used for recreational activities. It seems to me that, in an appropriate case, the informed voluntary participation of passengers in maritime joyrides could be one of ""the circumstances of the case"" to be taken into account under s 13(3), so far as obvious risks to the passengers are concerned - not as an absolute defence, but as a relevant consideration in judging whether the operation of the vessel can be said to be reckless or negligent. 

85In any event, as the Magistrate did not treat these matters as exculpatory, the third ground of appeal fails. 

Ground 5 - are facts found necessarily conclusive of guilt? 

86The Authority's fifth ground of appeal is that the Magistrate erred in failing, on the facts as found, to hold that there had been a contravention of s 13(1)(b), or alternatively s 13(1)(a). 

87The defendant does not accept that this ground involves ""a question of law alone"", but submits that it is at least a mixed question of law and fact. 

88There will be an error of law if the decision-maker, having found the primary facts, reaches a conclusion on the ultimate issue which on those facts is not legally open [see: Hope v Bathurst City Council (1980) 144 CLR 1, 7 (Mason J); Hayes v Federal Commission of Taxation (1956) 96 CLR 47, 51 (Fullagar J)]. As it was put by Glass JA (with whom Samuels JA agreed) in Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 (at 156): 

... an ultimate finding of fact, even in the absence of a misdirection, may reveal error of law if the primary facts found are necessarily within or outside the statutory description and a contrary decision has been made... 

89A further illustration of this category of error of law, germane to the present case, may be found in Dennis v Watt (1942) 43 SR (NSW) 32, a prosecutor's appeal against Mr Watt's acquittal on a charge of driving a motor car negligently in a public street, in which the magistrate had concluded that just because Mr Watt had been momentarily 'overcome with sleep', it did not follow that he was negligent. Jordan CJ said (at 32): 

In this case the question which the magistrate had to decide was whether, upon the facts found by him to be established by the evidence, the accused had been guilty of driving a motor car negligently in a public street, contrary to the provisions of s. 4 of the Motor Traffic Act , 1909. What the Statute penalises... is the act of driving negligently, and the question of whether negligence has occurred in essentially one of degree. From certain findings of fact it would necessarily follow, as a matter of law, that an accused person had been negligent; from other, that he had not. Between these extremes, however, there lies a broad limbo in which, upon the facts found, the question whether negligence had occurred would depend upon the view taken of their relative importance and significance. In such a case, the ultimate determination becomes also one of fact, and a decision either way by a tribunal of fact cannot be said to be wrong in law, unless it appears that the case has been so decided because some legal principle has been wrongly applied. 

90The Authority submits that the facts found by her Honour necessarily fell within s 13(1)(b), or alternatively s 13(1)(a); alternatively put, that from those facts it necessarily followed that Petty Officer Rofe had operated the vessel recklessly or negligently. 

91The Authority's characterisation of the relevant facts found by her Honour for may be summarised as follows: 

(1)The activity was an extra voluntary activity for officer cadets which followed completion of the planned adventure training activity, essentially for recreational purposes, described as a ""sea jolly"", a ""joyride"", and a ""bit of fun"" (at [7]); 

(2)This involved the Defendant ""operating the vessel at speed and making quick, sharp turns during which some officer cadets fell overboard and were subsequently recovered into the vessel"" (at [7], [10]); 

(3)At least one officer cadet fell overboard in each of the six groups, and in two of the rides two officer cadets fell overboard. A total of at least eight officer cadets, most likely more, fell overboard during the rides (at [10]); 

(4)While there were differences in the perceptions of individual officer cadets of its extent, the high speed turns exerted considerable force on participants and those who were unable to maintain a hold fell overboard (at [11]); 

(5)It was clear that officer cadets were going to fall overboard in the circumstances, indeed the challenge to hold on was at the heart of the excitement of the activity (at [29]); 

(6)The defendant knew that officer cadets could fall overboard (at [22]); 

(7)Some significant safety advice had been given prior to the rides, and more earlier in the day (at [25]); 

(8)The defendant accepted that ""any person overboard is a serious event"" (at [26]); 

(9)The defendant was familiar with operating the vessel, and knew that the propeller was uncovered (at [21]); 

(10)Earlier in the day, during instruction for the fast water insertion exercise, the defendant instructed the officer cadets ""to avoid the rear of the vessel or be turned into burley, and as to how they were to get into and out of the vessel"" (at [21]); 

(11)""Clearly and with the benefit of hindsight, an uncovered propeller was a potential risk to anyone in its immediate vicinity"" (at [21]); 

(12)There was ""no evidence that the defendant, an experienced and highly regard boatswain in the Royal Australian Navy, was aware of any prior propeller strike issues""; the only evidence of danger appearing from what happened to Officer Cadet Minchin, as at least seven others had fallen overboard without incident (at [21]); 

(13)The defendant, while not conceding that the vessel would present its rear to those in the water as it turned, accepted that it was possible that it would do so; that this possibility would depend on the angle of turn, and the distance and angle of the person from the vessel; and that this was a potential risk but not that it made the activity dangerous (at [24]); 

(14)There was no evidence as to the significance of propeller strike in this context, only that it can, unfortunately, occur. There was no explanation as to why or why only Officer Cadet Minchin came into contact with the propeller. There was nothing from which it could be concluded that falling overboard would place a cadet in proximity with the propeller. While there were submissions as to momentum, there was no evidence as to that, or as to where cadets hit the water in relation to the rear of the vessel. There was insufficient information from which to answer the question beyond reasonable doubt that was this a horrific and remarkable incident or was it a real risk, something to be expected (at [27]). 

92In considering this ground, so far as it concerns the negligence offence under s 13(1)(a), I bear in mind that I have concluded that the test according to which her Honour directed herself was too demanding, and apply what I have held to be the correct test, namely whether there was a departure from the standard of care for others (including the officer cadets) to be expected of the ordinary prudent operator in all the circumstances. 

93It is true that the activity was an ""optional extra"", not a requirement of the officer cadets' adventure training exercise. Thus, to the extent that it increased the risk to which participants were exposed, it did so gratuitously. The incurring of risk gratuitously as distinct from for some necessary or useful purpose may inform the characterisation of conduct as reckless or negligent. Against that, risk is often incurred voluntarily for recreational and experiential purposes. 

94Being thrown overboard was an obvious and at least serious possibility. Indeed, it was close to inevitable that some participants would be thrown overboard. However, in the context of this type of activity on enclosed waters, and in the absence of any suggestion that the officer cadets included non-swimmers or did not have safety vests, the mere risk of going overboard was not associated with a consequence of personal injury; it was associated only with a consequence of getting wet. While the prosecutor before her Honour, and on appeal, emphasised the concession elicited from the defendant that ""any person overboard is a serious event"", that concession simply does not equate to one that such an event had - in the relevant circumstances - potentially grave consequences. In my judgment, the facts found in this respect plainly did not dictate that there was necessarily recklessness or negligence. 

95Thus her Honour was right to identify, as she did at the outset (at [12]), that the real issue was not the mere risk of being thrown overboard, but the risk of being thrown overboard in the context of the vessel turning and having an uncovered rear propeller - that is to say, the risk of propeller strike. As to this: 

(1)It was obvious, and the defendant knew (and indeed warned the officer cadets) that if one came into contact with the propeller, serious personal injury not only could but would ensue. An uncovered propeller posed the risk of grave consequences to anyone in its immediate vicinity; 

(2)However, what was missing was any evidence bearing on the likelihood of a participant who was ejected from the vessel when making a turn coming into the immediate vicinity of the propeller. The Magistrate referred to this in several respects. Her Honour referred to photographic evidence showing that the propeller ""is located under the outboard motor at the rear within and underneath the larger winged keel and with the inflatable sides of the vessel extending either side of the outboard motor"", no doubt because that evidence tended to suggest that it would be difficult for someone in the water to come into contact with the propeller. Then her Honour observed that there was no evidence of any awareness by the defendant, an experienced Navy boatswain, of any prior such issues; no evidence as to the significance (meaning incidence) of propeller strike in this context; no explanation as to why and why only Officer Cadet Minchin came into contact with the propeller; and no evidence as to where participants hit the water in relation to the rear of the vessel. Her Honour did not find, and does not appear to have been invited to find, that use of a propeller guard was a standard or usual precaution. 

96This deficiency in the evidence culminated in the critical conclusions (at [27]-[29]) that: 

(1) there was nothing from which it could be concluded that falling overboard would place a cadet in proximity with the propeller; 

(2) there was insufficient information to answer beyond reasonable doubt that this was the materialisation of a real risk, ""something to be expected"", rather than a horrific and remarkable incident; 

(3)the evidence did not enable it to be determined whether ""the activity was inherently risky and therefore reckless or criminally negligent, or simply a freak occurrence, an accident""; and 

(4)thus it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that there was in the circumstances a ""real"", obvious and serious risk of propeller strike. 

97The Authority submitted that the Magistrate wrongly required evidence to establish: 

(1)the defendant's awareness of prior propeller strike issues, when the danger was so clear and fully understood by him, and when in any event subjective understanding of the risk is not relevant. However, this conflates his undisputed awareness of the grave consequences of propeller strike should it occur, with his absence of any knowledge of it ever having occurred in the context of the type of activity he was carrying out or with the type of vessel he was using. Moreover, her Honour was not insisting that awareness of the risk be established as an element of the offence: so much is plain from her references to Lord Diplock's speech in Lawrence on mens rea . Rather, she referred to the defendant's lack of awareness - emphasising his considerable experience - because awareness of a person experienced in the field was relevant to an assessment of the likelihood of the relevant risk; 

(2)""the significance of propeller strike"", when it was plain that being struck by a propeller could be devastating. However, in the context in which it appears - including her Honour's reference to Petty Officer Rofe's earlier warning, in the context of the fast water insertion exercises, about avoiding the rear of the vessel to avoid being ""turned into burley"" - it is plain that by ""significance"" her Honour meant ""incidence""; and/or 

(3)""the precise momentum of cadets falling from the boat as the vessel turned as to establish the degree of likelihood of the cadets being placed directly in proximity with the propeller"", when this would impose a degree of scientific certainty and precision not required for this type of offence, which was concerned with risks of harm and did not require proof that harm was certain or likely to result. 

98Indeed, all three of the matters mentioned in the preceding paragraph were referred to by her Honour as potentially informing a judgment as to the likelihood of propeller strike. Her Honour's conclusion was that there was insufficient evidence to enable such a judgment to be made beyond reasonable doubt. Contrary to the Authority's submissions, far from accepting that these offences are concerned with the mere existence of risks and not with their likelihood, my conclusions under Ground 1 demonstrate that their likelihood is an essential integer in each offence. In the case of recklessness in particular, the prosecution bore the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that there was an ""obvious and serious"" possibility of propeller strike. In essence, her Honour found that on the evidence, the prosecution failed to do so, and accordingly, recklessness could not be established. Similarly, the Authority's inability to establish on the evidence any basis for a conclusion as to whether propeller strike was ""something that might be expected"" as distinct from ""a freak occurrence"", contributed to the conclusion that negligence was not established. 

99That is not to say that evidence to inform such a judgment will always be required in every context, nor that the evidence necessary to inform such a judgment has to provide ""scientific certainty and precision"" as to the likelihood of a risk. Typically, negligence is proven by departure from a standard behaviour or precaution. In the field of motor vehicles, which will be widely familiar to most tribunals of fact, the court will frequently be sufficiently informed by its own experience: as Lord Diplock pointed out in R v Lawrence (at 982) , ""in deciding this, they [the jury]may apply the standard of the ordinary prudent motorist as represented by themselves"". Common experience may less frequently enable such a judgment in maritime cases. Evidence that use of a propeller guard was a standard precaution on this type of vessel or in this type of activity might well have enabled a conclusion that engaging in the activity absent such a precaution was at least negligent, but there was no suggestion that such a case had been advanced before the Magistrate. In the absence of that type of evidence, and of evidence enabling a judgment as to the likelihood of the relevant risk materialising, her Honour was not able to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that it was an obvious and serious risk, or that it was unreasonable to incur it. 

100These were quintessentially factual conclusions, within the province of the tribunal of fact and not open to review in this Court. As Lord Diplock said in Lawrence, it is for the jury to decide whether the risk created by the manner in which the vehicle was being driven was both obvious and serious and, in deciding this, they may apply the standard of the ordinary prudent motorist as represented by themselves. It is implicit in that statement that those are questions of fact. Likewise, in connection with negligence, Burbury CJ's statement that the enquiry is whether having regard to the matters mentioned in the section, the tribunal of fact is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has driven carelessly - that is, without due care - implies that the question is one of fact. 

101Her Honour's relevant factual conclusions, not open to review in this Court, include, critically, that the evidence did not establish the likelihood or chance of propeller strike, nor that the incident was not a freak occurrence but the materialisation of a real, obvious and serious risk - not "" a horrific and remarkable incident"" but ""a real risk, something to be expected"". Those conclusions are essentially dispositive of this ground of appeal, because they underpin the conclusion that the charges were not proved, and they are findings of fact, not susceptible to review on an appeal limited to ""a question of law alone"". 

102In relation to recklessness, while her Honour accepted that there was a real risk of participants falling overboard, but in the absence of evidence informing a judgment either as to the likelihood of their coming into contact with, or into the immediate proximity of, the propeller, or that there was a departure from usual practices and precautions, and upon findings of fact that it was not possible to be satisfied to the requisite standard that the accident was other than a freak incident, or that there was a real, obvious and serious risk of propeller strike, he r Honour's conclusion that she could not be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was reckless was reasonable, if not inevitable. Similarly, in relation to negligence, and bearing in mind the correct test for criminal negligence as explained above, and that it is less demanding than that applied by her Honour, the same deficiencies in the evidence left the Magistrate unable to determine beyond reasonable doubt that it was unreasonable to incur the potential risk, so that it was reasonably open on the facts found to entertain a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not negligent. Moreover, it seems to me that the Magistrate's conclusion that on the evidence she was unable to ascertain the ""likelihood"" of the risk materialising, such that it was not possible to ""distinguish between whether the activity was inherently risky and therefore reckless or criminally negligent, or simply a freak occurrence, an accident"" means that it would have equally been impossible to decide that the conduct was negligent applying the correct test, so that even on the proper test her Honour not only could but would have dismissed the negligence charge also. 

103It follows from the foregoing that on the primary facts found, the Magistrate was not bound to find either offence proven. Ground 5 therefore fails. 

Disposal 

104Accordingly, only Ground 2 of the appeal is made out. A clear consequence is that the acquittal of the offence under s 13(1)(b) of reckless navigation must stand. The less clear consequence concerns the offence under s 13(1)(a) of negligent navigation. The defendant submitted that, even if Ground 2 be made out, I should decline to remit the matter for a new trial on negligence and instead dismiss the appeal, as a matter of discretion under Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 59(2), which provides that the Supreme Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to in s 56(1)(c) by setting aside the order and making any order it thinks just, or dismissing the appeal. 

105In its terms, s 59(2) empowers the Court, on an appeal by a prosecutor against an order made by the Local Court dismissing a matter the subject of any summary proceedings, on a ground that involves a question of law alone, to set aside the order under appeal and make any order it thinks just, or dismiss the appeal. But w hether this provision confers a general discretion to dismiss an appeal has been doubted. In Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald [2004] NSWSC 182 (at [33]-[37]), Sully J said: 

I have twice referred to a perceived entitlement ""in principle"" on the part of the plaintiff to some relief. That has been because of a submission put by learned counsel for the first defendant to the effect that the power conferred by section 59(2) of the Appeal and Review Act is a discretionary power akin to the discretionary power reposing in the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 

The submission is, that is to say, that even in a case in which this Court finds that there have been errors of law apt to vitiate the relevant order of the Local Court, there remains in this Court nevertheless an overriding discretion to refuse relief because of what is conventionally described as ""double jeopardy"". 

Insofar as I have been persuaded that the learned Magistrate did make an error of law apt to vitiate her Worship's order, I accept at once that no fault in that connection can be laid at the feet of Mr Wunderwald. I accept as of course that it is only to be expected that he will be certainly disappointed, and probably indignant, to think that the order dismissing the information laid against him is defective in law, and that there opens up before him the prospect of a rehearing in the Local Court. 

As to all of those considerations, I would say this: I am not persuaded that the words ""may determine"" which appear in section 59(2) of the Appeal and Review Act do confer an overriding discretion of the kind to which the submissions of learned counsel for the first defendant refer. It is, however, unnecessary to determine finally that point, because even if I were persuaded that the statutory expression carried with it such an overriding discretion, I would not think it right to exercise such a discretion adversely to the plaintiff in the present proceedings. 

If it be correct to suppose that a Local Court magistrate has made an order vitiated by fundamental error of law; and more so, if one of those fundamental errors of law is a failure to accord procedural fairness to the prosecution; then I cannot suppose it to be correct, either in principle or in practice, to refuse to intervene in order to correct such a state of affairs. To do so would be, in my view, not to give effect to the statute, but to deprive it of the effect which, as it seems to me, the Legislature clearly intended that it should have. 


106Nonetheless, just because a ground of appeal is sustained, in the sense that an error is established, does not mean that the appeal must succeed, in the sense that the order appealed from must be set aside or varied. Thus Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act , s 65, provides: 

(1) A conviction, order or sentence is not to be set aside on an appeal merely because of: 

(a) an omission or mistake in the form of the conviction or order, or 
(b) an error in law in the order or sentence, 

if it appears to the appeal court that there were sufficient grounds before the Local Court to have authorised a conviction, order or sentence free from the omission, mistake or error. 

(2) In such a case, the appeal court: 

(a) may amend the conviction, order or sentence and determine the appeal as if the omission, mistake or error did not exist, or 
(b) may remit the matter to the Local Court to make the conviction or order, or impose the sentence, authorised by law and to amend the conviction, order or sentence accordingly. 

107While the view has been taken that this section, like its predecessors, does not allow a judge to make findings of fact on the hearing of the appeal and then substitute a new set of reasons for the erroneous reasons of the magistrate, it being directed to omissions, mistakes or errors in law in the form of conviction, order or sentence [ Director of Public Prosecutions v Attallah [2001] NSWCA 171; Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153, 173-5], the language of s 59 is similar to that of many statutes giving rights of appeal, and it is a general principle of appellate procedure that, as appeals lie from orders (not from reasons), an appeal will not succeed if an error has not affected the order. Appellate courts have a discretion to decline to order a new trial, notwithstanding the establishment of error, if there has been no miscarriage of justice - in other words, if the error could have made no difference to the result. Thus Balenzuela v De Gail (1959) 101 CLR 226, states that where evidence has been wrongly rejected, a new trial will be granted , unless it appears that the evidence rejected could not have affected the jury's verdict . In Stead v State Government Insurance Commission (1986) 161 CLR 141 , Mason , Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ endorsed the proposition that an appellate court would not order a new trial if it would inevitably result in the making of the same order as that made by the primary judge at the first trial, as an order for a new trial in such a case would be a futility (at 145): 

For this reason not every departure from the rules of natural justice at a trial will entitle the aggrieved party to a new trial. By way of illustration, if all that happened at a trial was that a party was denied the opportunity of making submissions on a question of law, when, in the opinion of the appellate court, the question of law must clearly be answered unfavourably to the aggrieved party, it would be futile to order a new trial. 

108Thus, if it appeared that an error by the Magistrate was irrelevant to or did not affect the ultimate decision, the order would not be set aside. 

109There are other circumstances in which error, even if material to the outcome, may not result in an appeal disturbing the order below, particularly where the relevant issue has not been agitated at first instance. The public policy that favours the just and efficient conduct of proceedings and finality in litigation limits the circumstances in which parties may raise on appeal new matters, the general principle being that they ought to be bound by the way they conduct the proceedings. In Metwally v University of Wollongong (1985) 60 ALR 68, the High Court stated (at 71): 

It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case had been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so.

... it is a sound general principle, leading not only to the maintenance of fair play, but also to the repression of unnecessary litigation, that parties must be bound by the course they deliberately adopted at the trial. 

111Consistently with this principle, parties are ordinarily precluded from raising new matters on appeal, although this is not an absolute rule. In Coulton v Holcombe (1986) 162 CLR 1 , Gibbs CJ, Wilson J, Brennan J and Dawson J said (at 7): 

It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish. 

112In RTA v Graincorp, after referring to Coulton v Holcombe, Handley AJA said (at [115]): 

The principle applies with special force in criminal proceedings, particularly to the prosecution. 

113It is a strong factor against permitting a point to be raised for the first time on appeal, though not an absolute bar, that it was deliberately not raised, or expressly conceded, at the trial, or is inconsistent with the manner in which the case was conducted at trial. And as the Court of Appeal pointed out in Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd v Federal Airports Corp , e ven where all the facts have been established beyond controversy or the point is one of construction or of law, a party does not have a right to insist that a new point be decided on appeal. It remains a question of whether the appellate court ""may find it expedient and in the interests of justice to entertain the point"" [citing Water Board v Moustakas (1988) 180 CLR 491, 497; see also Jones v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 63 FCR 32, 47], and it is relevant to take into account the difficulties of establishing that the putative error had any effect on the outcome of the case (at 646). 

114Before the Magistrate, counsel for the prosecutor submitted: 

... negligence here is different from the common law duty of care, my friend is plainly correct. Thus as I indicated to Your Honour a moment ago it's unnecessary to prove damage. Because of that it is not necessary to go into issues such as reasonable foreseeability of injury. The negligence invoked in this type of context is the more colloquial usage of carelessness as supported by the definition in the Concise Oxford Dictionary. 

115Counsel for the defendant submitted: 

One's not dealing with the negligent concept in civil law but one is dealing with negligence as a criminal concept and that is negligence that is worthy of a criminal penalty or carelessness that's worthy of a criminal penalty... what one is dealing with is a criminally culpable degree of carelessness... it means... that the risk must be of such degree that the taking the risk itself is worthy of criminal sanction. 

116Counsel for the defendant then referred to Buttsworth at 671, but added: 

... the principle is still the same that it's a higher degree of negligence that's required than is required by the civil law. I accept unreservedly that it is not the amount of negligence that will be required as in a prosecution for a case of involuntary manslaughter. 

117Counsel for the prosecutor replied: 

I don't think there is a lot of difference between my learned friend and I on the law. So I don't propose to say much about that. They're essentially consistent I think what we said. I won't say anything more. 


118Only on appeal did the Authority contend that the proposition that a higher degree of negligence was required than under the civil law was erroneous. The Magistrates' erroneous references to ""criminally culpable negligence"", a ""higher degree of negligence ... than under the civil law"", and ""negligence to the criminal degree"" reflected common ground before her Honour as to the applicable law. This being a criminal appeal, there are - as Handley AJA observed in the passage cited above from Graincorp - strong reasons, including those that fall under the general rubric of ""double jeopardy"", why the prosecutor, not having argued the point below, should not now be permitted to complain of that error. 

119Moreover, in this case the difficultly of being satisfied that the error had any effect on the outcome of the case reinforces that view. In Ground 5, I have concluded that, even substituting the correct test for that applied by the Magistrate to the primary findings of fact, her Honour not only could but would have acquitted the defendant of negligence; in other words, ultimately her Honour's application of too stringent a test for negligence made no difference to the result. 

120In those circumstances, it would not be in the interests of justice to uphold the appeal on the basis of Ground 2 alone. 

Conclusion 

121My conclusions may be summarised as follows. 

122As to Ground 1: the actus reus of the offence of reckless navigation requires that the defendant so operate the vessel as to incur risk (1) that is obvious, (2) the likelihood of which is serious, in the sense that it is a serious - and not fanciful, very slight or merely theoretical - possibility, and (3) the potential consequences of which involve personal injury or substantial property damage. However grave the potential consequences, the likelihood of the risk materialising must be at least real, obvious and serious. Her Honour was right to insist that more than a mere possibility, but a ""real"" and ""obvious and serious"" risk of propeller strike was required to establish the actus reus of recklessness for the purposes of s 13(1)(b). Nor does the mere presence, or foreseeability, of a risk - however grave its potential consequences - make a case of negligence; the likelihood of the risk materialising informs the reasonableness of incurring it. Negligence no more than recklessness can be established by the mere incurring of a risk with potentially grave consequences. Her Honour was right not to infer negligence from the mere foreseeability of the relevant risk. Ground 1 therefore fails. 

123As to Ground 2: the authorities make plain that it is erroneous to conflate criminal and civil negligence, and that they ought to be treated individually as separate concepts, but not that the standard of care of a reasonably careful operator, or the degree of departure from it, required to establish the offence of operating negligently is any different from that required to establish civil negligence. The criminal concept is simply of a departure from the standard of care for other road users to be expected of the ordinary prudent operator. Her Honour misdirected herself in this respect, in insisting on ""criminally culpable negligence"" of a higher degree than would be required to establish breach of duty in a civil case. Her Honour should have asked only whether there was a departure from the standard of care for others (including the officer cadets) to be expected of the ordinary prudent operator in all the circumstances. Ground 2 is therefore made out. 

124As to Ground 3: her Honour did not treat the voluntary participation of the officer cadets in this activity for fun and excitement as exculpatory, referring to those matters for the purpose of demonstrating the high likelihood that some would fall overboard (as distinct from being injured). Accordingly, Ground 3 fails, although, in an appropriate case, the informed voluntary participation of passengers in maritime joyrides could be one of ""the circumstances of the case"" to be taken into account under s 13(3), so far as obvious risks to the passengers are concerned - not as an absolute defence, but as a relevant consideration in judging whether the operation of the vessel could be said to be reckless or negligent in all the circumstances. 

125As to Ground 5: contrary to the Authority's submissions, these offences are not concerned with the mere existence of risks; their likelihood is an essential integer in each offence. Whether there was a ""serious and obvious"" risk of propeller strike, and whether incurring the risk in the circumstances was unreasonable such as to amount to want of due care, were questions of fact on which the Magistrate had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. Her Honour's relevant factual conclusions, not open to review in this Court, include, critically, that the evidence did not establish the likelihood or chance of propeller strike, nor that the incident was not a freak occurrence but the materialisation of a real, obvious and serious risk - not "" a horrific and remarkable incident"" but ""a real risk, something to be expected"". Those conclusions underpin the conclusion that the charges were not proved, and they are findings of fact, not susceptible to review on an appeal limited to ""a question of law alone"". In relation to recklessness, while her Honour accepted that there was a real risk of participants falling overboard, in the absence of evidence informing a judgment either as to the likelihood of their coming into contact with, or into the immediate proximity of, the propeller, or that there was a departure from usual practices and precautions, and upon findings of fact that it was not possible to be satisfied to the requisite standard that the accident was other than a freak incident, or that there was a real, obvious and serious risk of propeller strike, he r Honour's conclusion that she could not be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was reckless was reasonable, if not inevitable. Similarly, in relation to negligence, and bearing in mind that the correct test for criminal negligence as explained above is less demanding than that applied by her Honour, the same deficiencies in the evidence left the Magistrate unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was unreasonable to incur the potential risk, so that it was reasonably open on the facts found to entertain a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not negligent. Moreover, it seems to me that the Magistrate's conclusion that the evidence did not permit a finding as to ""likelihood"" of the risk materialising such as to enable the court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the activity was inherently risky and therefore reckless or criminally negligent, as distinct from ""a freak occurrence, an accident"", means that it would have equally been impossible to decide that the conduct was negligent applying the correct test. Accordingly, even applying the correct test her Honour not only could but would have dismissed the negligence charge also. It follows that on the primary facts found, the Magistrate was not bound to find either offence proven, and Ground 5 therefore fails. 

126The ""negligence"" test adopted by the Magistrate was in effect common ground before the Magistrate. This being a criminal appeal, there are strong reasons, including those that fall under the general rubric of ""double jeopardy"", why the prosecutor not having argued the point below, should not now be permitted to complain of the error in Ground 2. That view is reinforced by the difficultly of being satisfied that the error had any effect on the outcome of the case. In those circumstances, it would not be in the interests of justice to uphold the appeal on the basis of Ground 2 alone. 

127My order is that the appeal be dismissed. 

128I will hear the parties, if they wish, as to costs. 

Counsel addressed on costs 

129The successful respondent/defendant applies for an order that the appellant/prosecutor pay the respondent's costs of the appeal. The (NSW) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, s 70, imposes limits on the circumstances in which the costs of an appeal may be awarded against a public prosecutor, such as the present appellant. It relevantly provides that costs are not to be awarded in favour of an appellant whose conviction is set aside unless the Appeal Court is satisfied of one of a number of matters. The present case is not one of an appellant whose conviction is set aside, but one of a respondent/defendant whose acquittal at first instance was upheld on appeal. In those circumstances, s 70 is not applicable. 

130Section 72 of that Act provides that an Appeal Court that orders an appellant or respondent to pay costs must state a time within which the costs must be paid. That poses difficulties in circumstances where, unless the costs are agreed, they will have to be assessed. Nonetheless, I can comply with that section by stating a time relative to the issue of a certificate of assessment. 

131In making the order I am about to make, I do so on the basis that at this stage, and without having heard argument on the issue, it appears to be the appropriate order given the structure of that Act, the circumstances in which the Act does and does not impose limitations on when costs orders should be made, and the outcome of the proceedings - in particular, the respondent having succeeded in maintaining the acquittal that prevailed at first instance. However, the appellant has sought an opportunity to make further submissions on this issue, and so the order is made provisionally: it may well be that the appellant could advance arguments that some different order should be made. 

132Accordingly, I order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings, such costs to be paid within 28 days after a certificate of assessment issues. I reserve leave to the plaintiff to apply by 23 January 2012 for some different or other order as to costs.

2708678,R v Bruce GOSEN (No 2) [2011] NSWDC 261,"Judgment


1In the same case in which I have just given a judgment, R v Bruce GOSEN [2011] NSWDC 260, Mr McLachlan indicated that he wished to lead evidence about the reasons for travel of another traveller who was on the same flight as Mr Gosen. There was a man named Mr Baryer on the flight. The prosecution case is that Mr Baryer was effectively an overseer for Mr Gosen. Mr Baryer's job was to make sure that the drugs contained in Mr Gosen's luggage arrived and were dealt with safely. 

2When Mr Gosen was arrested he included amongst his reasons for travel - in explaining to the police his visit to Australia - catching up with a relative whom he had not met before and whom he had not been in direct contact with before leaving Canada. Mr McLachlan wished to lead evidence to the effect that Mr Baryer also proffered an explanation to the police that he was visiting a relative and that there was little else that he knew about the relative. 

3The evidence was put forward as what Mr McLachlan described as systems evidence, the argument being that the accused Mr Gosen and Mr Baryer and others were members of a syndicate that they ""if all approached by law enforcement officers, have put forward a reason that they're travelling out here to visit a relative who they've never contacted, who they don't know us - the relative does not know the person who's travelling to Australia through any direct contact."" Mr McLachlan wanted the evidence in order to found a submission that ""this is what happens when operatives, that is people involved in the syndicate, are apprehended or intervened or in some way questioned by law enforcement authorities here in Australia"".

4Mr McLachlan indicated that the evidence was not tendered as tendency or coincidence evidence. 

5Mr Watts objected to this evidence and I rejected the evidence and indicated that I would give my reasons later. 

6Strictly speaking, because the evidence is not tendered as coincidence or tendency evidence, it may not be regarded as such evidence but, nevertheless, to my mind, it clearly has the character of coincidence evidence, namely that it was a remarkable coincidence that two persons on the same flight gave very similar and unlikely explanations for their visit to Australia. No notice was given of coincidence or tendency evidence because it was not tendered as such. 

7To my mind, however, there is a real prejudice or potential prejudice that the jury could use the evidence impermissibly as coincidence evidence. I regard its probative value - which although it had some significance - as being outweighed by the danger of the unfair prejudice to Mr Gosen which I have just described. 

8For those reasons I refused to admit the evidence tendered by Mr McLachlan under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.

		12 December 2013",2011-12-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708681,Robert CHIBWE v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 287,"Judgment 

1ALLSOP P: I agree with Rothman J 

2LATHAM J: I agree with Rothman J 

3ROTHMAN J: Robert Chibwe was charged with recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime worth over $100,000, contrary to section 400.4 (2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) . A jury convicted him after a trial of over two weeks conducted before Ainslie-Wallace DCJ (as she then was). Her Honour sentenced Mr Chibwe to a term of imprisonment of two years and six months, to be released on recognisance after one year and six months, thus requiring him to be of good behaviour for a further 12 month period. The recognisance period commenced on 6 August 2010 and the overall sentence concluded on 5 August 2011. 

4The appeal was heard after the sentence had been concluded, because the first time that the matter was listed for hearing, Mr Chibwe sought and obtained an adjournment and the notice of appeal had not been filed until 28 January 2011. 

5Mr Chibwe appeals the conviction, but not the sentence. The grounds of appeal are: 
""1. The guilty verdict of the jury was marred by prejudices, and bias; 

2. The credibility of the jury was tarnished, when the trial judge allowed a juror to study who declared after five days into the trial and voir dire, that he works in the bank; 

3. Racial slurs and homophobia were prevalent throughout the trial; 

4. The jury relied mostly on circumstantial and coincidental evidence to arrive at their verdict. Thus could not have arrived at their verdict beyond reasonable doubts (sic)."" 

6In order to convict Mr Chibwe, the Crown needed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that: Mr Chibwe dealt with money or property of an amount greater than $100,000; the money or property was proceeds of crime; and at the time that Mr Chibwe dealt with the money or property, he was reckless as to whether the money or property was proceeds of crime. The offence is a serious one for which the maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment or a fine of $66,000 or both. 

7Mr Chibwe was represented at the trial by experienced counsel. The Crown prosecutor, also a person experienced in the criminal law, conducted the matter fairly and appropriately. I make the foregoing comment because of the nature of some of the grounds of appeal. Her Honour's conduct of the trial and her summing up were impeccable and beyond criticism. Certainly, Mr Chibwe makes no criticism of her Honour. 

Unreasonable verdict 
8At least one of the grounds of appeal raises the unreasonableness of the verdict. It is necessary to deal briefly with the principles to be applied in such circumstances. 

9The approach to be taken by an intermediate court of appeal where the unreasonableness of the verdict has been raised, has been dealt with by the High Court of Australia on a number of occasions. This Court is required to assess the evidence independently and to consider its sufficiency, quality and nature and if, having so considered the evidence, it experiences a doubt as to the guilt of the appellant, it is a doubt which, generally, a jury also ought to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving such a doubt that the Court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 . 

10This approach was considered in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13. Just prior to the judgment of the High Court in SKA , this Court, in Brendon Singh v R [ 2011] NSWCCA 100, had occasion to deal with the test expressed by the High Court in both M and MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 . After reciting passages from the joint judgment in M , this Court said: 

""[10] The focus must be on the unreasonableness of the verdict, and the term ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"", although sometimes still used, ought not be. Further, whether the verdict was ""open to the jury"" does not itself, answer the question. The focus of the examination is whether the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt, which is answered by whether the appellate court has a reasonable doubt that cannot be answered by paying regard to the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence. See also R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38 ; (2010) 85 ALJR 8. 

[11] Concentration on the expression as to whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt may lead to some confusion. The focus of the enquiry is not whether there is evidence upon which a jury could have convicted (ie whether there was evidence of each element of the offence),but whether it was open to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt (ie whether, on all of the evidence, it was open to be satisfied that there was no reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence)."" 

11In SKA , the High Court unanimously confirmed the approach in M and MFA , with which the foregoing approach is consistent, even though the judges of the High Court differed in the application of those principles. 

Evidence at the Trial 
12The offence was said to have been committed on 27 April 2006. The Crown case was relatively simple. Mr Darren Cranshaw and Mr Jonathan Marven were said to be members of an Identity Crime Syndicate. 

13On 27 April 2006, Messrs Cranshaw and Marven fraudulently transferred $315,000 from the bank account of a company in the name of Boomdell Pty Ltd. The money was transferred from the Boomdell account to a bank account controlled by Mr Chibwe, in the name of ""Robert Chibwe t/a Auscam Investments"". 

14Mr Cranshaw committed the fraud by attending the Martin Place branch of the Westpac Bank and falsely assuming the identity of the account holder, Mr William Sheridan. Mr Cranshaw then electronically transferred the money from the Boomdell bank account to Mr Chibwe's account referred to above. 

15Shortly after the funds arrived into Mr Chibwe's bank account, he transferred $312,808.97, in two transactions, at two separate Westpac branches, to a bank account controlled by a money exchange business called City Forex (Aust) Pty Ltd. A co-accused, Cyril Ihem eje, then went to City Forex and purchased US $200,000 and €25,000. Mr Ihemeje then provided a proportion of the foreign currency to Mrs Cranshaw and Marven. 

16The foregoing was not in issue at trial. Mr Chibwe was an associate of Mr Ihemeje, who operated a money exchange business in the city, called CC Money Exchange. 

17On 30 March 2006, Mr Chibwe registered a business name, ""Auscam Investments"", and utilised that name to open a bank account with Westpac. On the same day, Mr Chibwe opened another bank account with Westpac. On 10 April 2006, Mr Chibwe opened a further bank account with St George Bank and another with ANZ. 

18On 20 April 2006, $80,000 was dishonestly appropriated from a bank account in the name of Edwin Shirley Staging Pty Ltd and transferred into Mr Chibwe's account at St George Bank. St George Bank was notified of the fraud by the police and reversed the transaction. 

19The fraud syndicate, who had been provided with Mr Chibwe's bank account details and informed that the $80,000 had not arrived into his account, requested his statement, which confirmed that the transfer had been unsuccessful. Mr Ihemeje called Mr Chibwe on seven occasions during the course of the day. 

20On 27 April 2006, the fraudsters dishonestly appropriated $315,000 from the Boomdell Pty Ltd bank account. This amount was transferred to the account of Mr Chibwe at Westpac. It was not alleged that Mr Chibwe participated in the fraudulent removal of the funds from Boomdell. 

21Mr Chibwe admitted that he had dealt with the funds. The only real issue was his state of mind on 27 April 2006 when he transferred the amounts referred to above. 

22The Crown case was that Mr Chibwe received a commission to deal with the funds and was reckless as to the fact that the money or property was the proceeds of crime. 

23Documents, being Western Union records, disclose that Mr Chibwe sent $31,555 in international money transfers to various overseas locations between 17 April 2006 and 8 August 2006. During that time, Mr Chibwe was receiving social security payments. 

24As already stated, the evidence disclosed that Mr Chibwe was an associate of Mr Ihemeje, who operated a money exchange business in the City called CC Money Exchange. 

25Messrs Cranshaw and Marven were members of an identity crime syndicate that fraudulently took money from financial institutions. Both admitted the fraud on financial institutions that gave rise to the money transferred by Mr Chibwe. A member of the identity crime syndicate known as ""Fung"" provided Mr Cranshaw with instructions and identification in the name of William Sheridan. Mr Cranshaw was instructed to use his false identification to assume the identity of Mr Sheridan and falsely transfer funds from the Boomdell bank account into Mr Chibwe's bank account. 

26At 12:11 pm on 27 April 2006, Mr Cranshaw entered the Martin Place branch of Westpac and fraudulently transferred the aforesaid $315,000. 

27At 1:53 pm Mr Chibwe attended the Westpac Bank branch on the corner of Market Street and Clarence Street and transferred $270,270.27 from his bank account to the account in the name of City Forex. 

28At 2:27 pm, Mr Chibwe went to the Surry Hills branch of the Westpac Bank and transferred $42,538.70 from his account to the City Forex account. This transaction is captured on CCTV foot age. Mr Ihemeje was seen in the vicinity and entering the bank at about the same time. 

29Later that day, Mr Ihemeje attended the offices of City Forex and purchased US $200,000 and €25,000. 

30Mr Ihemeje retained 40 percent of the foreign currency as commiss ion and provided the balance to members of the identity crime syndicate. 

31As was required under law, Mr Ihemeje submitted a cash transactions report to AUSTRAC. That report falsely claimed that Mr Ihemeje had received $312,809 in cash from a person by the name of Maxwell Howard in exchange for the full amount of US dollars and euros. Maxwell Howard is a false name. 

32Mr Marven received about 5 percent of the foreign currency and handed over to Mr Cranshaw US $28,000. 

33The Crown case was, as revealed above, simple. It consisted of surveillance evidence showing Mr Chibwe transferring funds. Technical evidence was also adduced which traced the transfers to and from Mr Chibwe's accounts and to and from those consciously engaged in the fraud and the victims thereof. Those engaged in the fraud gave evidence disclosing the means by which the fraud was perpetrated and Mr Chibwe's role in transferring moneys. 

34Mr Chibwe complains that the jury ought not to have believed those involved in the fraud. Her Honour warned the jury in appropriate terms as to the approach to be taken to the evidence of these offenders. Moreover, the Crown does not suggest that Mr Chibwe was knowingly concerned in the fraud. Were the Crown to have done that, far more serious offences would have been involved. Instead, the Crown alleged a reckless involvement, which does not require that Mr Chibwe knew of the fraud. 

35M r Chibwe's case was straightforward. Mr Chibwe arrived in Australia from Zambia in 2003 and sought asylum in Australia because of his sexuality. He was granted permanent residency. He could not look for work until the end of 2005. 

36In Zambia, Mr Chibwe ran a business as a tourist operator. His intentions were to set up a similar business in Australia. Mr Chibwe maintained that he did not know and did not suspect that the money with which he was dealing was proceeds of crime. 

37Mr Chibwe said that he wanted to set up a business in Australia to sell mobile phones. It is for that reason, he says, that he registered the name ""Auscam Investments"". He estimated that the establishment cost of the business was approximately $45,000. 

38Mr Chibwe also said that he had met Mr Ihemeje at the latter's business premises in early 2006. They became good friends described by Mr Chibwe as ""like brothers"". 

39Mr Chibwe regularly spent time at Mr Ihemeje's office, CC Money Exchange, where he was introduced to a builder by the name of ""Maxwell Howard"" (""Max""). ""Max"" expressed the view that he was interested in providing the start-up capital of $45,000 to Mr Chibwe, as a result of which Mr Chibwe provided Mr ""Howard"" with his banking account details. 

40On 27 April 2006, Mr Ihemeje rang Mr Chibwe and told him that ""Max"" was at CC Money Exchange and wanted to see him. Mr Chibwe went to CC Money Exchange, met ""Max"", who told him he had found the money for his business. 

41Mr Chibwe and ""Max"" then went to Westpac Haymarket branch and Mr Chibwe used the ATM to check if the funds had arrived. Mr Chibwe says he was surprised to find $315,000 in his account. ""Max"" told Mr Chibwe that he was prepared to invest all of that money in Mr Chibwe's business on certain conditions. The conditions were unacceptable to Mr Chibwe and he decided to return the money. 

42Mr Chibwe and ""Max"" went to the Westpac Bank branch at the corner of Market Street and Clarence Street. ""Max"" gave Mr Chibwe a piece of paper with instructions as to the amount of money ($270,270.27) that he would be required to transfer and the bank account into which it was to be transferred. Mr Chibwe carried out the instructions he was given, while ""Max"" waited outside the bank. 

43After that Mr Chibwe and ""Max"" went to the Surry Hills branch of Westpac and ""Max"" gave him another piece of paper with similar instructions, this time to transfer $42,538.70 to another account. Again, Mr Chibwe carried out the instructions given. An amount of $2,191.03 from the original $315,000 remained in Mr Chibwe's bank account. 

44Of that remaining amount, Mr Chibwe claims that he gave $800 to Mr Ihemeje. 

45As a result of the foregoing, there is still an amount of $31,555, which Mr Chibwe transferred overseas through Western Union between 17 April 2006 and 8 August 2006, which remains unresolved. In the proceedings, Mr Chibwe claimed that a significant proportion of those funds were derived from money he earned in exchange for sexual favours. In short, Mr Chibwe maintained that he had been paid the aforesaid sum as a prostitute. 

46The foregoing is an accurate summary of the transcript of the proceedings before the court below. It is taken largely (but not entirely) from the summary of proceedings provided by the Crown on the appeal. That summary was not the subject of challenge and Mr Chibwe accepted the accuracy of the summary. Having read the transcript, so do I, but I have added some remarks to clarify the nature of the evidence adduced. Because the summary was not disputed, it is appropriate, to the extent possible, to repeat it, or, at least, to rely on it as an agreed summary. Whether or not it was agreed, it is an accurate summary. 

Ground 1: Miscarriage As a Result of Prejudice and Bias 
Ground 3: Racial Slurs and Homophobia 

47I will deal with grounds 1 and 3 together. 

48During the course of the trial one of the witnesses, called by the Crown, described Mr Chibwe as a ""fat black man"" and as a ""black guy"". This was Mr Marven's evidence. It was part of the recital of a telephone conversation with a co-offender Mr Dowling. Part of the conversation included the description of Mr Chibwe as ""a black guy"", ""big, big guy and fat"". 

49Mr Marven was overseeing the withdrawal of money and was describing to one of his cohorts the movement of Mr Chibwe. The phone call was played in Court. Mr Marven made clear that he did not know Mr Chibwe's name, and knew him only as a black guy and by the descriptions already given. 

50The colour of Mr Chibwe's skin was a distinguishing feature in his identification. The term ""black"" was not used insultingly. Even if it were, in the context of the trial as a whole, it could not be said that the description given to Mr Chibwe during the course of this evidence occasioned either prejudice or bias. Nor were the descriptions used as a racial slur. 

51The allegation of ""homophobia"" to which Mr Chibwe refers in his written submissions is a reference to what Mr Chibwe perceived was the ""squeamishness"" of the jury in relation to his sexual preferences and the amount of money that he could earn providing sexual services to other people. 

52The evidence as to Mr Chibwe's sexual preferences is evidence adduced in Mr Chibwe's case, not by the Crown. There is no evidence, fresh or otherwise, to suggest that the jury reacted in a way which was visible or audible. No evidence is adduced from Mr Chibwe's solicitor or counsel at the trial as to the reaction of the jury during the trial. 

53At best, Mr Chibwe's assertions are suspicions with no basis in fact. There is no basis upon which this Court could find that the race or sexual preference of Mr Chibwe was a factor affecting the jury during the course of its deliberations or during the trial itself. These two grounds are rejected. 

Ground 2: A Juror Worked in the Bank 
54On Friday 27 March 2009, evidence was adduced relating to the role of Group Security of the Commonwealth Bank. An employee of the Commonwealth Bank had processed a transaction of some $80,000 for a co-offender of Mr Chibwe, which unbeknown to the employee was fraudulent. The employee had received a telephone call from Commonwealth Bank Group Security, after which the employee had reversed the relevant transaction. When this evidence was adduced at trial, a juror indicated, through the sheriff's office, that he worked for the Commonwealth Bank. This note was given, apparently, as the juror was leaving on the Friday afternoon. 

55Her Honour consulted counsel on the Monday morning and had already taken the steps to sequester the juror on arrival on the Monday morning. The after some discussion, the juror was called and gave evidence on the voir dire. The note was in the following terms: 

""I want to advise that I am employee of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia staff (sic). My job is computer systems although I do not know Shane or Greg Walton or anyone at the Maitland branch. I do have contact with Group Security for my job. Group Security was mentioned today by Greg."" 


56Her Honour asked whether the juror knew ""anything about this trial or the facts of this trial other than that which you have heard during court""? The juror replied in the negative. No counsel sought to ask a question. 

57Her Honour also warned the juror not to make enquiries or to seek to have enquiries made. To that warning the juror responded: ""Yes of course and I have not done so."" 

58No application was made thereafter for the disqualification of the juror or the discharge of the jury. Plainly, the note was written as a matter of abundant caution and displays the seriousness with which the juror approached the task before the Court. 

59As the discussion between her Honour and counsel disclosed, the operations of the Commonwealth Bank were at best peripheral to the charges before the Court. There was no application for disqualification or discharge. Nor could any such application have been successful, as it had no basis. 

60The issue was dealt with appropriately by her Honour and by Mr Chibwe's legal representatives. There is no basis for this ground of appeal. 

Ground 4: Reliance on Circumstantial and Coincidence Evidence and Unreasonable Verdict 
61No application was made during the course of the trial to adduce evidence under section 98 of the Evidence Act 1995. Given that Mr Chibwe is, on this appeal, unrepresented, the absence of coincidence evidence, in a formal sense, ought not to be taken as conclusive against the ground of appeal upon which Mr Chibwe relies. 

62It seems that Mr Chibwe uses the term ""coincidence"" as emphasis of the term ""circumstantial"" and is referring to the absence of direct evidence as to Mr Chibwe's state of mind at the time of the transactions. 

63The Crown case at trial was not unusual for this kind of case. Rarely is there direct evidence of the state of mind in a charge that requires the proof of recklessness. Ordinarily, a jury is asked to infer recklessness from the conduct of the accused. This case is no different. 

64There was sufficient evidence before the jury from which the inference of recklessness could be drawn and the mere fact that the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence does not vitiate the jury's verdict. 

65Otherwise, the ground relies upon the proposition that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable. I have earlier recited the principles that should be applied in determining whether the verdict of the jury is unreasonable. 

66I have read the entirety of the transcript and accept the general accuracy of the Crown summary of the evidence and of the cases led by the Crown and the defence. Having read the evidence, I do not have a doubt of the kind described by the High Court in M v R. I have weighed the competing evidence adduced at trial and I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, on the evidence, that Mr Chibwe committed the offence of which he was convicted. This ground of appeal is also rejected. 

Orders 
67Before this Court, Mr Chibwe did not seek leave to appeal. An appeal as of right arises only when the appeal ""involves a question of law alone"". No ground of appeal raised by Mr Chibwe involves a question of law alone. Each ground raises, in one form or another, a miscarriage of justice or the reasonableness of the verdict. 

68As a consequence, leave to appeal is necessary: Krishna v DPP [2007] NSWCCA 318; Alramadan v DPP [2007] NSWCCA 322. This appeal involves an appeal against conviction and, even though the applicant has already served the sentence imposed upon him, the importance of his reputation, particularly in circumstances where he had no prior convictions, is sufficiently important to warrant leave. 

69As a consequence of the foregoing, I propose that the Court make the following orders: 
(i) Leave to appeal granted; 
(ii) Appeal dismissed.

2708685,HATFIELD v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 286,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Hall J. 

2HIDDEN J : I agree with Hall J. 

3HALL J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by the District Court at Sydney. The hearing took place on 30 April 2009 and 1 May 2009. He was sentenced on 28 August 2009. 

4The Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court on 16 September 2010. The appeal was therefore commenced out of time. At the hearing, counsel for the respondent Crown did not oppose leave being granted and to that effect, leave was granted to hear the appeal. 

5The applicant was charged with both Commonwealth and State offences as follows:- 

""Count 1: Conspiracy to import cocaine, not less than the prescribed commercial quantity applicable thereto, contra s.233B(1) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and s.11.5(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) ('the Commonwealth offence'); and 

Count 2: Did knowingly take part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of cocaine contra s.25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) ('the State offence')."" 

6On 13 December 2007, the applicant pleaded guilty to Counts 1 and 2. Taken into account on the offence charged under s.25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, were three offences as follows:- 

""1. On 7 May 2003, knowingly taking part in Supply Prohibited Drug, namely, 6.27 kilograms of cannabis. 

2. Between 1 December 2004 and 9 May 2005, engaging in money laundering. 

3. On 26 April 2005, being in possession of a pistol without being authorised by licence or permit."" 

7The commercial quantity of cocaine prescribed in the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) was two kilograms. A large commercial quantity of cocaine is prescribed by the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act to be one kilogram. 

8Section 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) provides that a person charged with conspiracy is punishable as though the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed. The maximum penalty prescribed by s.235(2)(c)(i) of the Customs Act is life imprisonment and/or a fine not exceeding $825,000. 

9The maximum penalty for an offence against s.25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act involving not less than a large commercial quantity of cocaine is a fine of 5,000 penalty units or life imprisonment, or both: s.33 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act . 

Particulars of Sentence 

10On the State offence, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years, with a balance of 7 years, commencing from 9 May 2005, with the non-parole period to expire 8 May 2015 and the balance to expire on 8 May 2022. 

11On the Commonwealth charge, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 24 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 12 years. The sentence commenced on 9 May 2007. The non-parole period was specified to expire on 8 May 2019 and the balance of term on 8 November 2031. 

12The sentences are partially accumulated to the extent that except for the first two years of the State offence, the Commonwealth offence subsumes the balance of the State offence. 

13As set out in her Honour's Remarks on Sentence, a discount of 30% was allowed for the applicant's plea and assistance for the Commonwealth offence and a discount of 15% was allowed for the State offence. I will return to the significance of the differentiation in the sentencing discounts later in this judgment. 

14Her Honour took into account the three offences specified in a Form 1. 

Statutory Provisions 

15In respect of the Commonwealth offence, s.233B of the Customs Act (as it was then) is reproduced hereunder:- 

"" 233B Special provisions with respect to narcotic goods 

(1) A person commits an offence if:- 

(a) the person:- 

(i) possesses goods on board a ship or aircraft; or 

(ii) brings goods into Australia; or 

(iii) imports goods into Australia; or 

(iv) possesses goods that have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act; or 

(v) conveys goods that have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act; or 

(vi) possesses goods that are reasonably suspected of having been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act; or 

(vii) fails to disclose to an officer on demand any knowledge in his or her possession or power concerning the importation or intended importation, or bringing or intended bringing, into Australia of goods; and 

(b) the goods are a prohibited import to which this section applies."" 

16In establishing the crime of conspiracy, s.11.5 of the Criminal Code is as follows:- 

"" 11.5 Conspiracy 

(1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed. 

Note: Penalty units are defined in section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914."" 

The Grounds of Appeal 

17The grounds of appeal relied on for the purposes of this application are as follows:- 

""1. Her Honour erred in assessing the discount to be given for the pleas of guilty by failing to adequately consider the circumstances surrounding the timing of the plea of guilty and assessing the first reasonable opportunity. 

2. Her Honour erred in finding that the question of the fitness of the applicant to plead was raised four months after his committal 

3. New evidence is available concerning the time at which the issue of the fitness of the offender to plead and to instruct was first raised the absence of which would cause an injustice to the offender the absence of which at sentence led her Honour to impose a sentence without having due regard to relevant evidence. 

4. New evidence is available concerning the issue of delay in entering the pleas of guilty the absence of which led her Honour to sentence in the absence of relevant evidence. 

5. Her Honour erred in failing to take properly into account the mental health of the applicant when imposing sentence and failing to give expression to it in the head sentences imposed. 

6. New evidence is available concerning the mental health of the applicant the absence of which would cause an injustice to the applicant and the absence of which led her Honour to sentence without relevant evidence before her. 

7. Her Honour erred in finding there was no evidence before the Court that the offender was mentally ill at the time of the offences. 

8. New evidence is available concerning the issue of delay between arrest and sentence the absence of which would cause an injustice to the applicant and the absence of which led her Honour to sentence without relevant evidence before her. 

9. The sentencing of the offender failed to take into account and give expression to the issue of delay in sentencing. 

10. Her Honour erred in limiting the discount for assistance given to authorities to the sentence imposed in respect of the Commonwealth offence only and not to the total sentence imposed on both Commonwealth and State offences."" 

The Commonwealth conspiracy offence 

18The relevant facts may be summarised briefly as follows. On 8 October 2004 the applicant, with the assistance of a number of co-offenders, including a registered informant, imported from South America 9.99kg of cocaine, of which 6.975 kilograms were recovered by police at a later date. Of that 6.975 kilograms, 4.460 kilograms was pure cocaine, the purity ranging between 59.2% and 69.6%. 

19The Commonwealth offence charged the applicant with a conspiracy which included both the actual importation of almost 10 kilograms of cocaine on 8 October 2004 and a proposed importation of a larger quantity of cocaine, initially 20 kilograms, but potentially larger, planned to occur in early 2005. This part of the conspiracy was discontinued as a result of the conspirators' correct belief that they were under investigation. 

20Between March and May 2005, the applicant conspired unsuccessfully to bring into Australia 30 kilograms of cocaine. After he and his co-offenders discovered police interest in their operation, the transaction was suspended and no further cocaine was brought into the country. Investigating police received information regarding the conspiracy from a number of sources including electronic surveillance. 

The State supply offence 

21The State offence encompassed a series of supplies of cocaine in which the remaining balance of the cocaine imported on 8 October 2004 was distributed to customers of the applicant and to ""Tom"" , an associate of the applicant who had become an informer in late 2004. ""Tom"" , acting on behalf of police, continued to participate in the planning by the applicant and others for the proposed importation and the supply of the imported cocaine. 

22The supplies took place pursuant to controlled operations certificates. 

23An amount of two kilograms of cocaine, at the direction and organisation of the applicant, was supplied to one Gedeon for the sum of $340,000 on 8 February 2005 ($300,000 was provided to the applicant's associate on that date, and a further $40,000 was later supplied). 

24A further one kilogram was supplied, on 23 February 2005, to persons, Finch and Dowe, for an amount of $170,000, of which $120,000 was given to a third party (Pavan). The transaction was organised and controlled by the applicant whilst the actual exchange was attended to by an associate of the applicant. 

25On 24 February, 250 grams of the cocaine was given to persons, Alexandridis and Zaiter, in exchange for $40,000. Of that sum, $1,000 was given to a Mr Sevastopolous for brokering the deal. The rest was to be given to the applicant who, as noted above, was the owner of the cocaine and the ultimate controller of its distribution. 

26On 25 February 2005, 28 February 2005 and 4 March 2005 a further kilogram of cocaine on each occasion was supplied in exchange for $170,000, $160,000 and $165,000 respectively. 

27On 17 March 2005, 750 grams of cocaine was again supplied, on the applicant's behalf by his associate, to Gedeon in exchange for $120,000. 

The grounds of appeal 

28At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, Mr G Nicholson QC, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, sought leave to rely upon the affidavit of his instructing solicitor, Mr Whitby, sworn on 24 June 2011. Mr Nicholson foreshadowed that he would seek to rely upon ""new"" medical evidence that had not been placed before the sentencing judge. It was conceded, however, that the evidence had been available as at the time of the sentence hearing. 

29In explanation, Mr Nicholson stated that the ""new"" material related to the applicant's medical history. The reports of two psychiatrists had been admitted at the hearing on sentence. The authors of those reports, Dr Giuffida and Dr Westmore, had relied on matters of medical history but Mr Nicholson observed the historical medical records dealing with that history had not been tendered. The opinions expressed had, in other words, not been supported by the tender of such material. Mr Nicholson said (transcript, 30 June 2011 at p.3):- 

""... I seek to rely upon this material in order to give a better understanding of those opinions expressed by those psychiatrists which was not available unfortunately to her Honour as the underlying documents behind each of the psychiatrists on each side were not tendered although referred to."" 

Grounds 1 to 4 

30These grounds, produced in paragraph [17] above, were argued together. 

(1) Applicant's submissions 

31The essential complaint is that the sentencing judge did not treat the applicant's pleas of guilty as having been made at the first reasonable opportunity. It was contended that, owing to the applicant's mental health, he was not in a position to instruct or plead from the time of his arrest on 9 May 2005 until a date in July 2007. The applicant's guilty pleas, it is to be noted, were not entered until 13 December 2007. It was said that, although the applicant continued to be mentally ill, he was nonetheless, in due course, found to be fit to stand trial. 

32In the submissions for the applicant, it was stated that the applicant's previous unfitness based on his mental health was known to both parties as existing during the committal hearings, which it was said continued with him being ""a non-participant"" . The legal representative then appearing for the applicant apparently did not seek to adjourn the committal proceedings until the applicant was fit to instruct and plead. 

33Accordingly, in these circumstances, it was contended that the sentencing judge erred in finding the question of the fitness of the applicant to plead was only raised four months after his committal and not before. 

34As a separate complaint in relation to the actual sentences imposed, it was contended that the sentencing judge failed to properly take into account the applicant's past, present and ongoing mental ill health. In particular, it was claimed that there was sentencing error in failing to take into account his mental health issues when imposing the head sentences in respect of Counts 1 and 2, rather than limiting them and to be given expression only in the non-parole period. This complaint is dealt with in relation to Grounds 5 to 7. 

(2) Crown submissions 

35The Crown, in its written submissions (paragraph [11]), stated that it was inaccurate to say that committal proceedings proceeded with the applicant being ""non-participating"" or absent from them. The proceedings were adjourned from time to time until the date of his committal for trial, which was, in effect, a paper committal. The applicant's case had been adjourned during the examination of various prosecution witnesses and other procedural matters over the preceding weeks from 27 February 2006. 

36The Crown produced a Court Chronology , an abbreviated version of which is set out below. 





Date 

Event 


9 May 2005 

Applicant arrested and charged. Bail refused. To appear before Central Local on 10 May 2005 


27 February 2006 

Central Local Court. Defence indicated accused suffering from a psychiatric illness and not in a position to enter pleas. 


22 March 2006 

Central Local Court. Applicant committed for trial in respect of Counts 1 and 2. 


11 October 2006 

Sydney District Court. Determination made that applicant unfit to stand trial. 


18 July 2007 

Sydney District Court. Applicant found fit to stand trial. 


13 December 2007 

Sydney District Court. Applicant enters guilty pleas. Stood over to 3 April 2008 for sentence. 

37In the submissions for the applicant, it was contended that the reference to the first available opportunity to enter a plea should be understood, in the circumstances of the present case, as referring to the first reasonable opportunity to enter a plea. 

38In the Crown's submissions, it was contended that the issue in question relates to the significance of the timing of the plea and what is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case. In this respect, reference was made to R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 419 [160]. 

39The Crown noted that the guilty pleas were entered five months after the finding of fitness to plead. That fact, by itself, it was submitted, would justify the limitation on the discount for the pleas to the offences, albeit which her Honour may have imposed for a different reason. 

40The Crown frankly noted that the written submissions of the Crown in the District Court, whilst correct in their terms, did not make mention of what the applicant's legal representatives had said at the committal or at mentions in the District Court prior to the fitness hearing on 9 October 2006 concerning the applicant's mental condition. 

41The Crown, in paragraph [13] of its written submissions in this Court observed:- 

""It is unclear whether her Honour's conclusion about the quantum of the discount for the plea to either charge would have been different if she had been directly informed about what had transpired at the committal but the detail of the chronology of the matter had been further explored. The chronology does not establish that the question of fitness to plead was always the impediment to a consideration of a guilty plea although it is accepted that it was raised as a potential issue early in the history of the matter in the District Court."" 

42To that extent, the Crown fairly acknowledged that the conclusion by the sentencing judge, that the issue of fitness to plead had only been raised four months after the committal, was arguably incomplete (although it was noted that the fitness hearing, on which her Honour apparently relied, in fact, took place some five and a half months after the applicant was committed for trial on 22 March 2006). 

Decision 

(1) The timing of the applicant's guilty pleas 

43Grounds 1 to 4 raise for consideration the following issues:- 

(1) The timing of the applicant's pleas and whether they should have been considered to have been entered at the first available and/or first reasonable opportunity having regard, in particular, to the evidence as to the applicant's mental health. 

(2) If the issue in (1) is resolved favourably to the applicant, whether the discount for the pleas in the circumstances of the case ought to have been higher than the discount of 15% determined by the sentencing judge. 

(3) Whether the sentencing judge erred in only applying the discount for the applicant's guilty pleas to the federal offence and not the State offence. (The Crown accepted that the failure to provide a discount for the plea to the State offence was an error). 

44The sentencing judge, in her remarks on sentence, set out a chronology of events commencing with the applicant's arrest on 9 May 2005, his first appearance before the District Court on 31 March 2006 followed by adjournments until his arraignment on 9 October 2006. The chronology also included the finding made on 11 October 2006 that the applicant was unfit to stand trial. 

45Her Honour noted that, on the evidence before her, plea negotiations were commenced by the applicant's legal representatives which were resolved with the entry of the pleas on 13 December 2007. Her Honour added (at p.35):- 

""Although I appreciate that the issue of the offender's fitness to plead delayed the time when he could properly consider a plea, in my view, it cannot be said that he pleaded at the first available opportunity. He was committed for trial ten months after his arrest and the issue of his fitness was apparently raised some four months later. The plea does show a willingness to facilitate the course of justice and may also be some evidence of contrition on his part, however, the plea should be viewed in the context of a strong Crown case and, to that extent, the plea was a recognition of the inevitable."" 

46In respect of the period commencing from his arrest on 9 May 2005 and 11 October 2006 (the date of the ""unfitness determination"" ) the issue, as indicated above, is whether there was sufficient evidence to establish that the applicant was so affected by mental illness that it was reasonable that he did not enter guilty pleas in that period. 

47Dr Westmore, in his report dated 19 June 2006, summarised under the sub-heading ""Document Review"" entries in notes from ""Corrections Health/Justice Health"" dated 4 August 2005, 3 November 2005, 24 November 2005, 14 March 2006, 14 March 2006 and 30 March 2006. 

48A number of those notes record assessments which stated that the applicant was as at those dates suffering from ""a borderline personality disorder"" and an ""adjustment disorder"" . 

49The notes indicated that after the last of those notes (30 March 2006) he was on ""treatment with an antidepressant and mood stabilising drugs continued"" : Dr Westmore's report, 19 June 2006 at p.10. 

50Dr Westmore relied upon those notes as confirmatory of his own diagnosis initially made in May/June 2006 (p.10). In that report, Dr Westmore stated (p.11):- 

""At present, it would be my view that Mr Hatfield is probably unfit to be tried."" 

51He added:- 

""It would seem from the Justice Health notes that Mr Hatfield has presented with a depressed and anxious mood and self-harming behaviour. The early clinical entries do not report the presence of psychotic symptoms although notes made in March reveal that he had been complaining of auditory perceptual disturbances and ideas of reference ..."" 

52I have carefully examined the reports of both Dr Westmore and Dr Giuffida and, having done so, I have concluded that Dr Westmore's analysis sufficiently establishes that the applicant's mental health was significantly impaired following his arrest on 9 May 2005 until he was found fit to stand trial on 18 July 2007. That finding, in my assessment, leads to the conclusion that it would not have been reasonable for him to have entered a guilty plea until after 18 July 2007. He, however, did not do so until approximately five months later on 13 December 2007. The latter delay should be taken into account in the determination of the discount to be allowed for the pleas entered. 

53I have concluded that the sentencing judge was in error in not assessing the discount for the pleas on the above basis. The discount determined by her Honour not having been determined on that basis, I consider this Court should intervene and reconsider the applicant's entitlement to a discount for the guilty pleas entered by him. 

54In the exercise of the discretion, I consider that the applicant on re-sentence is entitled to a discount for his pleas entered on 13 December 2007 of 20%. The delay of approximately five months after 18 July 2007, in my opinion, means that the maximum discount of 25% for an early plea is not available in this case. 

(2) The issue of an overall discount for assistance and the pleas 

55The sentencing judge considered the evidence on the issue of assistance (Exhibit B) and noted the relevant matters established by that evidence including the assessment that had been made on the assistance which Exhibit B addressed. There was no suggestion in this Court that her Honour overlooked any material matter or made an erroneous finding in relation to assistance. 

56At the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, Mr Nicholson sought leave to rely upon a letter from the New South Wales Crime Commission dated 30 June 2011. The Crown opposed leave being granted. The letter was admitted and marked as Exhibit A in the present proceedings. However, the presiding judge noted that its use may be restricted in determining the merits of this ground of appeal. 

57Having considered the terms of Exhibit B in the sentencing proceedings, I do not consider that Exhibit A adds anything of significance on the issue of assistance. 

58Accordingly, adopting the basis relied upon by the sentencing judge on the question of assistance on the basis of a plea discount of 20%, as discussed above, the total discount for the plea and assistance should be 35% in lieu of 30% as determined by the sentencing judge. 

Grounds 5 to 7 

59Grounds 5 to 7 were argued together 

60The medical evidence before the sentencing judge included reports from Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist dated 25 September 2006, 19 June 2006 and 28 April 2009. Dr Westmore stated that, as he had not seen the applicant at the time of the offences he indicated that he was not in a position to state unequivocally whether mental illness, which he later diagnosed as existing, was operative at the time of the applicant's offending. For the purpose of his three reports, Dr Westmore undertook assessments of the applicant on 26 May 2006, 16 June 2006 and 25 September 2006. 

61Exhibit 5 in the sentencing proceedings included reports from Dr Michael Giuffrida, forensic psychiatrist, dated 21 August 2006, 12 February 2007, 8 June 2007, 6 May 2008 and 9 February 2009. Dr Giuffida initially saw the applicant at the request of his solicitor. He first saw him on 5 July 2006. 

62In his first report, Dr Giuffida reviewed a number of medical, hospital and psychologists' reports and records. He expressed the opinion, based on the history obtained from the applicant at that time, that the applicant was unfit to stand trial. The report of 21 August 2006 observed that, based on the material available, including hospital records and Justice Health notes, the applicant had, over a long period before August 2006, suffered from psychotic symptoms. 

63The historical hospital and medical records confirmed that the applicant had experienced psychotic symptoms many years before the offending the subject of these proceedings occurred. The history, in particular, included several references to episodic acute psychotic symptoms in the context of ongoing substance abuse. 

(1) Medical assessments of the applicant 

64The majority of the reports of both specialists were primarily directed to the issue of the applicant's fitness to plead. Dr Giuffida had access to medical reports from Macquarie Hospital, Manly Hospital and St John of God Hospital, Justice Health medical records and a report from Dr Olav Nielssen dated 12 December 2005 as well as a report of clinical psychologist, Dr Katie Seidler. 

65The volume of historical and other material analysed in the medical reports of both specialists is considerable. It is noteworthy that both Dr Giuffida and Dr Westmore concluded that the applicant, based on the history, was mentally ill during the periods of his offending conduct and they were in essential agreement that the mental illness played a direct role in the offending behaviour. As discussed below, there is a lack of specificity in the opinions expressed in this regard. 

66Dr Giuffida, in his report of 6 May 2008 referred to the historical records which indicated that the applicant had suffered from a psychotic illness as early as 1992 when he was admitted to Manly and Macquarie Hospitals, although he noted that that illness was likely to have been precipitated by drug usage. The summary of the medical records from those hospitals and from St John of God Hospital established that the applicant's psychotic or delusional disorder more than likely represented drug induced psychoses. 

67In his report of 6 May 2008, Dr Giuffida noted that the applicant suffered from a psychotic illness from the time that he entered custody on 27 May 2005 and that he continued thereafter to suffer from symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia. On the question as to the earlier existence of that condition, he observed (at AB 326):- 

""... It is on the other hand very highly likely that he had been developing this psychotic illness over at least the previous months but more probably the previous years and, in fact, the history available from Mr Hatfield's partner ... indicates that he had revealed his delusional beliefs for a number of years prior to his arrest. It is therefore almost certainly the case that Mr Hatfield would have been suffering from a psychotic illness at the time of the various offences of which he is charged ..."" 

68Dr Giuffida, in the same report, stated (AB 327):- 

""... Whilst I think it might be difficult to demonstrate a clear causal link between any particular delusional belief that he held at the time of the various offences, I think it is, however, suffice to say that his mental illness would have almost certainly caused a marked impairment of his capacity to exercise reasonable and sensible judgment."" 

69Dr Giuffida, in his report of 9 February 2009, also observed (AB 332-333):- 

""... Mr Hatfield certainly suffers from a mental illness within the meaning of the NSW Mental Health Act 2007. It is probable that his illness contributed at least to the commission of his offences and that appropriate treatment is available in the prison or forensic hospital ... 

In relation to the issue of the causal link between the chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness and his various offences, it is first of all clear that Mr Hatfield had a diagnosed probable paranoid psychotic illness in 1992 and has certainly had a persisting and ongoing schizophrenic illness from the time he came into custody in mid-2005 to the present time. I have always been of the view that it is more likely than not and, in my view, highly likely that he was suffering from symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia during the period of the commission of his offences."" 

70Dr Westmore, in his report of 28 April 2009, in commenting upon Dr Giuffida's conclusions, stated that the applicant suffered from a psychotic illness which was probably a chronic and a treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenic illness (AB 248). 

71In relation to diagnostic issues, Dr Westmore was requested to comment on particular issues. In that respect, he stated:- 

""3. Whether I agree with Dr Giuffida's conclusions that mental illness contributed to the commission of the offence for which Mr Hatfield is charged and, if so, how. 

Based on his history in relation to the offending behaviour, he was mentally ill at the relevant time and, again, based on his history, his mental illness played a direct role in the offending behaviour. His history indicates that he had delusional beliefs in relation to his actions. Unfortunately, I did not examine him at the time of the offending behaviour and another possibility is that Mr Hatfield was not mentally at the relevant time but subsequently has developed a chronic unremitting psychotic illness which incorporates retrospective delusional beliefs. In view of his history, however, that possibility seems less likely than the first suggested above . 

4. You have asked me whether Mr Hatfield was suffering from any psychiatric illness or condition at the time of the offences which affected his appreciation that [sic] was he was doing was wrong 

If Mr Hatfield was in fact psychotic at the relevant time and acting on delusional beliefs, then his capacity to appreciate the wrongness of his actions, certainly from a moral perspective is likely to have been compromised."" 

(2) Mental illness and sentencing principles 

72In R v Letteri (NSWCCA, unreported, 18 March 1992), this Court determined that mental illness was of significance where it may have induced the offence. The need for general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence may, however, be diminished even when it was not: see also Binnie v R [2010] NSWCCA 14 at [21]. 

73The principles in this respect are well known and have been applied in many cases. They were discussed in detail by Simpson J in R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] to [48]. 

74In relation to the Commonwealth charge, s.16A of the Crimes Act 1914 requires the Court, in sentencing an offender, to take into account:- 

""The character, antecedents, age, means and physical and mental condition of the person: s.16A(2), Crimes Act 1914 

75There have been cases where mental illness has had a real and direct causal link with offending behaviour. This has been so where the mental illness has operated to induce the commission of offences or where such illness has had a limiting effect on the offender's ability to control impulses or to make decisions about his behaviour. 

76In a particular case, the question of the relationship, if any, between a mental illness of an offender and the commission of the offence is one which depends upon and is to be evaluated having regard to the particular circumstances in the individual case. Expressions of medical opinion that a mental illness was related to an offence does not, in terms, address the nature and effect of any relationship. That is an important question in the circumstances of the present case. 

(3) The sentencing judge's conclusions on the significance of the applicant's mental illness 

77The sentencing judge analysed in considerable detail the evidence including, in particular, the specialist medical evidence in the remarks on sentence at AB 463-471. 

78The offending by the applicant plainly involved him participating in the performance of tasks involving considerable organisation, discussions, liaison with others and planning, in particular, in relation to the actual and proposed drug importations from overseas. The sentencing judge specifically referred to such matters. The evidence, including the electronic surveillance evidence, revealed that the applicant was able to actively participate in the making of the arrangements associated with the importation that took place. 

79I have earlier referred to the medical specialists' opinions to the effect that the offender, at the time of offending, suffered from a mental illness, namely paranoid schizophrenia. The sentencing judge, in forming her conclusions on the issue of the applicant's mental health, expressed reservations about the medical conclusions as to his mental health at the time of the commission of the offences as they were dependent on:- 

(1) The history given to them by the offender. 

(2) In the case of Dr Giuffida, the additional history obtained from the offender's partner. Her Honour then stated (at AB 470):- 

""It follows that in my view there is no evidence before the Court that his mental illness was actually operating in such a way as to diminish his understanding of the criminality of his actions. Accordingly, extreme caution should be exercised in relying on reports containing hearsay material provided by the offender and should be given limited weight. I refer to R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353."" (emphasis added) 

80The sentencing judge concluded (at AB 470-471):- 

""Accordingly, I am not satisfied on balance that the offender's mental illness played a direct role in his offending behaviour. The evidence reveals a very well planned criminal activity involving millions of dollars directed by the offender and Hurley. I have no doubt that it would have continued if the police investigation had not intervened."" 

81Her Honour then proceeded (at AB 471):- 

""Accordingly, in my view, the conspiracy offence is so serious that it must attract a sentence which reflects general deterrence. It is more appropriate, in my view, to have regard to the offender's mental health issues when the Court specifies a non-parole period. In this respect, I have regard to the opinions of both psychiatrists that the offender's mental condition is likely to deteriorate over years ..."" 

82I will return to the sentencing judge's conclusions below. 

(4) Assessment of the significance of mental illness in this case 

83In R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, Gleeson CJ observed at 71: 

""A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the court in the case of [Veen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465]. Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender. [at 68] 

... 

In truth, however, ... the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles . The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. By the same token, there may be a case in which there is an absence of connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence for which a person is being sentenced, but the mental disorder may be very important to considerations of rehabilitation, or the need for treatment outside the prison system."" [at 71] (emphasis added) 

84I am of the opinion that there was sufficient historical clinical and recorded medical material available to both Dr Giuffida and Dr Westmore (to which no objection was taken) for them to form and express the opinions that they did on the question of any relationship that may have existed between the applicant's mental health and his offending. With respect to the sentencing judge's reservations referred to in paragraph [79] above, the validity of their opinions was not wholly or even mainly dependent on the history provided by either the applicant himself for his partner. 

85However, as earlier indicated, that said, it is necessary to go beyond the medical opinions which were to the effect that the applicant's mental illness, in some relatively undefined way, had a direct role in the commission of the offences. 

86It is clear from the observations of Gleeson CJ in Engert (supra) that a more searching analysis of the evidence is required, if a causal connection with the offending is suggested, in particular, in order to identify the basis or way in which the applicant's psychotic illness played a role in the commission of the offences. There, of course, was no evidence that the applicant's schizophrenic illness itself induced the commission of the offences. There was no evidence that the applicant was driven by impulses which he was unable to control or that he had no understanding or comprehension of what he was doing in undertaking the planning and in carrying out the Commonwealth and State offences. Finally, it was not established in evidence, as was submitted on his behalf at the sentencing hearing, that he was delusional or acting under the influence of any delusions in committing the offences. In any event, as the Chief Justice observed in Engert (supra) at 71:- 

""... The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence ..."" 

87Although I have concluded that the medical evidence before the sentencing judge established that the applicant suffered from a psychotic illness at the time of the offences, I do not believe it was such as to establish a relevant causal relationship with his offending in any of the ways referred to in the preceding paragraph. 

88The existence of a serious and chronic psychotic illness at the time of the offending may, however, in accordance with established principles, be relevant in assessing the issue of general deterrence or otherwise be taken into account as one of the relevant factors in the sentencing exercise. In that respect, it is no different from that which is involved in every sentencing exercise: R v Currie (NSWCCA, unreported, 25 February 1992) per Gleeson CJ. 

89In R v Benetiz [2000] NSWCCA 21 at [36], Simpson J observed:- 

""36 ... For mental illness or a psychiatric condition to be relevant to sentencing, it is not necessary that it be the cause of the commission of the crime. Indeed, authority suggest that it is not necessary that it be a cause of the crime. I refer to the decision of this Court in R v Fahda ... There reference was made to a number of authorities of which the following are, on this issue, irrelevant. In R v Letteri ..., Badgery-Parker J said:- 

'In each of those cases [which he had, in the preceding paragraph, cited] it appears that the mental illness or retardation was a factor inducing the commission of the offence but that is not a necessary condition of the application of the principle .'"" (emphasis added) 

90Simpson J also observed in Benetiz (supra) at [38]:- 

"" A mental disorder such as the applicant's depression was identified by Gleeson CJ in Engert as being part of the circumstances of the individual case. Generally speaking, the well-known authorities indicate that mental disorder may be relevant to the assessment of the offender's culpability and to the levels of which it is appropriate to give greater or lesser emphasis to principles of general or specific deterrence ... "" 

91See also TC v R [2009] NSWCCA 296 at [68] to [70]. 

92In Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195, Howie J at [83] observed:- 

""The fact that an offender is mentally ill does not mean that the sentence imposed must be less than that imposed upon a person who commits the same criminal act without any abnormality of mind ..."" 

93The issue of the applicant's mental illness must be considered in the factual context of the case. The applicant over a period of time played a key role at a high level within an ongoing drug enterprise in relation to both the conspiracy to import cocaine and in the supply of that drug in this State. Although there is medical evidence to support the proposition that the applicant's mental illness did play a direct role in the offending, the medical specialists did not analyse in any detail the nature and extent of the applicant's activities associated with conspiracy or the supply offences before expressing that opinion. 

94It is unnecessary here to analyse in detail all the factual matters set out in the lengthy Statement of Facts tendered at the sentencing hearing. However, in order to appreciate the nature and level of the applicant's participation in the serious criminality involved in both the conspiracy offence and the supply offence, the following matters are noted:- 

(1) The Statement of Facts and the listening device material tendered in the Crown case established that the applicant was involved with co-offenders, Hurley, Mara and North in an on-going conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of cocaine. 

(2) The applicant was involved in critical decision-making as to the timing of the importations. He managed his side of the operation to coincide with the work rosters of corrupt airport workers. 

(3) The applicant received a significant share of the proceeds of the importation made on 8 October 2004 of 10 kilograms of cocaine. He arranged couriers and financing for the purchase of the cocaine. 

(4) The applicant and a co-offender, in relation to the proposed importation intended to occur in May 2005, arranged for another to be given US$100,000 and 37,500 Euros to be used by the other co-offender to purchase cocaine in South America. 

(5) Whilst there was evidence of an intention between the co-offenders Hurley and Mara that 20 kilograms of cocaine were to be imported in the May 2005 importation, it was the applicant who intended that a further 10 kilograms of cocaine be purchased (for which he provided the funds). The Crown submission was that the applicant's decision to increase the amount to be imported of the proposed importation from 20 to 30 kilograms was to maximise profit to himself. In consequence, the importation was evidence of decision-making which was consistent with the applicant's role as a principal. 

95It was the Crown's submission to the sentencing judge that the evidence supported the conclusion that the applicant was, with Hurley, at the top of the hierarchy in the conspiracy and that both men brought particular expertise to bear in carrying out the objects of the conspiracy. The material before the sentencing judge supported that submission. 

96The State offence committed by the applicant involved a continuing criminal enterprise or activity. It incorporated seven individual acts of supply by the person ""Tom"" at the applicant's request. Those supplies occurred on and between 8 February 2005 and 17 March 2005. 

97The Crown submission was that the amount of cocaine involved in the criminal enterprise the subject of the State charge was significant, being almost seven kilograms - about seven times the large commercial quantity of cocaine specified in the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act: Crown Submissions on Sentence at [62]. 

98The Crown submission was that the applicant was a principal in relation to the seven sales the subject of the charge. 

99The applicant was sentenced on the basis of State offence together with the offences on the Form 1. 

100The facts established in evidence for the purpose of the sentencing hearing, accordingly, did not demonstrate any particular incapacity, delusions or other mental illness factors contributing to the serious offences committed by the applicant over a period of time. 

101Whilst there was medical evidence to the effect that there are different types of schizophrenia and that it is possible for some people with paranoid delusions to perform tasks involving planning, sometimes quite complex planning, and organise matters, there was no detailed analysis of the applicant's criminal activities by the two psychiatrists. 

102I have earlier noted that Dr Giuffida considered that the applicant's mental illness would have almost certainly caused a marked impairment of his capacity to exercise reasonable and sensible judgment: Report of Dr Giuffida, 6 May 2008 at AB 327. 

103As earlier indicated, the evidence referred to above in relation to the conspiracy and supply offences failed to demonstrate any impairment in the applicant's capacity to undertake those activities. Indeed, the evidence to which I have earlier referred points in the opposite direction. 

104That leaves, as a matter of possible interpretation, that Dr Giuffida, in referring to the applicant's capacity to exercise reasonable and sensible judgment may have been indicating that the applicant's judgment was impaired in the sense of him making the decision to become involved in the importation and supply of cocaine. Whilst it is, of course, possible that a person suffering from a psychotic illness may be more vulnerable to entering into an ongoing criminal activity, there would need to be a proper factual foundation to support the conclusion that that is what contributed to the applicant's decision to become involved. There was no such evidence in this case to that effect. 

105The detailed Remarks on Sentence reveal a close consideration by the sentencing Judge to the issue of the applicant's mental illness. The question as to any possible relevance of the applicant's mental illness to his offending arises in circumstances in which the unusual nature of the offending allows for very little scope for mental illness, in this case, to operate or provide an explanation for the applicant's engagement in the criminal activity involving a high level of culpability. 

106On the particular facts of this case, I do not consider that the approach taken by the sentencing Judge has been shown as one involving appellable error. I, with respect, agree with the conclusion of Morgan DCJ that the conspiracy offence involved a level of criminality of such a high order that it was essential that the sentence to be imposed for that offence reflect the element of general deterrence. 

107Again, having regard to the particular circumstances of this case, there is, in my opinion, no basis for intervening in relation to the sentencing Judge's approach to taking into account the mental health issue in specifying the non-parole period, as determined in this case. 

Grounds 8 to 9 

108The submissions for the applicant raised the question as to what is termed ""delay"" in the proceedings before arrest and sentence and a further period of delay said to have arisen out of assistance given by the applicant. It was also alleged that additional delay was occasioned by the unavailability of the sentencing judge to pass sentence between the conclusion of the sentence hearing on 1 May 2009 and the date on which the Remarks on Sentence were delivered on 28 August 2009. 

109It was submitted that the delay was not delay for which the applicant was responsible or to which he contributed. Rather, it was argued it arose in the context of delay associated with his mental illness as well as the need for an extended period of time to elapse in relation to the issue of assistance. 

110The submission was that some element of ""additional leniency"" ought to have been allowed for in the sentences imposed: Applicant's Written Submissions at [12.2]. 

111In relation to the period of time between the arrest of the applicant on 9 May 2005 and the committal and fitness hearing in October 2006, I accept the Crown submissions that this was not ""delay"" in the relevant sense. Further, I accept, as was submitted by the Crown, that the period of time between a finding of fitness to plead (namely on 18 July 2007) and the sentencing hearing (on 30 May 2009 and 1 June 2009) was lengthy, but that such delays were generally at the request of the applicant. 

112Accordingly, I accept the submission by the Crown that the propositions enunciated in R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 do not apply. 

113Accordingly, in the circumstances referred to above, it is not necessary to deal further with this ground other than stating that the Crown submissions in this respect are plainly correct and no error by the sentencing judge has been established. 

114In relation to the asserted error in limiting the discount for assistance to the sentences imposed in respect of the Commonwealth offence only, the Crown, in its submissions, noted that it did not contend that the sentencing judge should have limited the discount for assistance to the Commonwealth sentence: Crown's Written Submissions at [39]. As the Crown observed, however, because of the structure of the sentences imposed, the discount for assistance afforded to the applicant on the Commonwealth offence operated in fact to provide the same effect as it would have operated if the same discount had been imposed on the sentence for the State offence. In other words, all but two years of the sentence for the State offence was subsumed by the accumulation of the more severe Commonwealth sentence. Accordingly, the Crown correctly submitted in those circumstances, the Court would not for that reason impose a less severe sentence for the State offence. 

115I consider there is no merit in these grounds of appeal for the reasons advanced by the Crown. 

116As I have concluded that sentencing error has been established in relation to the discount for the plea, I am of the opinion that this Court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant on the basis of a discount of 20% for his guilty pleas. 

Orders 

117I set out below the orders I propose to give effect to the conclusion expressed above that the applicant is entitled to a discount of 20% on sentence for his guilty plea in lieu of the discount of 15% as allowed by the sentencing judge. All other grounds in support of the application for leave to appeal are dismissed. 

118In re-sentencing the applicant to give effect to the conclusion referred to in the preceding paragraph the same ratio between the non-parole period to the total sentence for the offence of conspiracy to import as determined by the sentencing judge, namely a ratio of 48.9%, has been applied. 

119Accordingly, I propose the following orders:- 

(1) Leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by the District Court on 28 August 2009 be granted. 

(2) The sentences imposed by the District Court be set aside. 

(3) That the applicant be re-sentenced as follows:- 

(a) In relation to the offence under s.25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of 9 years and 2 months to commence on 9 May 2005 and to expire on 8 July 2014 and a balance of term of 6 years and 6 months to expire on 8 January 2021. 

(b) In respect of the offence of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of cocaine contrary to s.11.5(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 and with s.233B(1) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), the applicant to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of 22 years with a non-parole period of 11 years. The sentence is to commence on 9 May 2007 the non-parole period will expire on 8 May 2018. The total sentence will expire on 8 May 2029.

		22 December 2011",2011-12-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708701,R v Filippou [2011] NSWSC 1607,"SENTENCE 

1On 10 October 2011 Christopher Angelo Filippou was indicted in relation to two charges of murder. The first charge was that on 27 June 2010 he murdered Samuel Willis. The second was that on the same day he murdered Luke Willis. In relation to both charges the offender pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown did not accept this plea and the matter went to trial on the issue of murder. In accordance with an order previously made, a jury had been dispensed with and the trial proceeded by myself alone. 

2Identical issues were raised in relation to both charges. The sole defence raised by the then accused was the partial defence of provocation. In the end I determined that the Crown had disproved this defence beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, on 18 November 2011, I entered a verdict of guilty of murder in relation to both charges. I published my reasons for reaching that verdict. Subsequently, on 8 December 2011, evidence was tendered and submissions made by both parties relating to sentence. 

3The facts giving rise to the killings, briefly, are as follows. The two victims, Luke and Sam Willis, were brothers. They were aged respectively 28 and 22 at the time of their deaths. Since about 2000 they had been living intermittently in a house at Mayfield owned by their father. Sam Willis was still living there in June 2010. Luke Willis had moved out and was living in his own home at that time, but he kept in close contact with his brother and visited the house regularly. 

4In early 2009 the offender, Christopher Filippou, bought the house immediately to the rear of the Willis property, so that they shared a back fence. The offender lived there with his wife and his adult son. 

5About a year before the killings a neighbourhood dispute developed between the two households. This apparently had its genesis in a noisy drinking session in the Willis back yard in June 2009. A few days later an anonymous handwritten note was left at the Willis property complaining of the noise emanating from the household. Its terms were threatening. About seven months later, in January 2010, following another party in the Willis home, a further anonymous letter was received. This was again in threatening terms. A handwriting expert called by the Crown at the trial was firmly of the opinion that both letters were written by the offender, and I accepted this to be the case. 

6After receiving the first of these letters, Sam Willis canvassed the surrounding neighbours as to whether they knew anything about it, and whether they were concerned by noise emanating from the Willis household. According to what he told his father, the response was generally positive and sympathetic, except from the offender, who said: ""If you come around and threaten me again I will shoot you"". 

7A few acts of minor vandalism took place early in 2010 involving objects littered around the Willis property or paint sprayed on the front fence. The night before the killings, on Saturday 26 June 2010, Sam Willis and his friend Alex Best found a plastic bag on the Willis front lawn, containing a mass of dried leafy matter and a note containing the words, ""Cheers you dope from Alex"". Sam Willis was in no doubt as to who had left this bag on the front lawn, namely the neighbour immediately to the rear of the Willis house. He and his friend Alex decided to go round to the offender's home and talk to him about what had been happening. However, on the way they telephoned Luke who talked them out of it, saying that they might disturb the offender's children if they did so. Accordingly, instead of knocking on the offender's door, Sam and his friend poured the contents of the plastic bag onto the offender's white utility which was parked in the driveway of his home. Mr Best also scratched the words ""Suck me"" on the back of the utility. 

8On the evening of Sunday 27 June 2010, Luke and Sam Willis came to the Mayfield home after being out for much of the day and saw that the lounge room window at the front of the house had been smashed. A plastic bag containing telephone books had been thrown through the window. The Willis brothers had no doubt that it was the neighbour at the rear of their home who was responsible for the damage and they set out to talk to him. 

9I should interpolate here that the offender's son, Christopher Filippou Junior, gave evidence at the trial that it was he, not his father, who broke the front window of the Willis home. Despite real misgivings about this evidence, in the absence of any contrary evidence I had to conclude that this was the case and that the offender knew nothing about the breaking of the window. 

10It was at about 6 pm on the Sunday evening that Luke and Sam Willis arrived outside the offender's home. The offender's son had gone out earlier, so the offender was alone with his wife. Mrs Filippou said that she heard the two men calling out at the front of their home. She told the offender, who went straight down the hall and out the front door. 

11According to what the offender later told the police, when he went to the street outside, the two brothers were ""loudmouthing"". The older brother, Luke, whom the offender had never seen before, took a gun out of his pocket and said, ""I've got this"". The offender immediately grabbed the gun and shot Sam Willis through the neck and Luke Willis through the left side of his chest. Both men fell to the ground. The offender then fired a second shot into Sam Willis' chest. Both men were dead before the police or ambulance officers arrived at the scene shortly afterwards. 

12Immediately after the shooting, the offender went inside and asked his wife to telephone their son Christopher. He then returned outside and placed the revolver into Sam Willis' hand. After this he went back inside, collected his car keys and drove away. He spent the night with a friend and the next morning handed himself into the Belmont Police Station. Later that day he entered into a recorded interview with the police in which he freely admitted that he had shot the two brothers. He effectively said that they had asked for it by producing the gun. 

13There was thus no dispute that it was the offender, Christopher Filippou, who fired the fatal shots at Luke and Sam Willis. As already indicated, the only issue at the trial related to the partial defence of provocation, which reduces the offence from murder to manslaughter. As relevant here, the two issues raised under provocation were: first, whether the fatal shooting in each case was done as a result of a loss of self-control on the part of the offender, which was induced by conduct of the deceased towards him; and, secondly, whether the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. Once the issue of provocation has been raised, the burden lies on the Crown to disprove it beyond reasonable doubt. As already indicated, identical issues were raised in relation to both charges. It was accepted that provocation by either one of the Willis brothers would be relevant in relation to the killing of the other. 

14A significant factual issue arose under this defence, relating to the origin of the small .38 calibre revolver which fired the fatal shots. A considerable amount of evidence was devoted to whether it was Luke Willis who brought the revolver to the confrontation, as described by the offender, or whether it was the offender himself. Although I considered it unlikely that the revolver emanated from the Willis household, I was unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was lying when he said that it was Luke Willis who first produced the weapon. Accordingly, I accepted, for the purposes of the trial, that it was Luke Willis who brought the revolver to the confrontation. 

15In considering whether the offender had lost his self-control when he fired the fatal shots, I took into account the offender's actions immediately after the killing, which did not denote the actions of a person who had lost control of himself. Of even greater significance were the numerous statements made by the offender well after the event in which he continued to justify his conduct and to indicate that he would do the same thing again in the same situation. He even said at one stage that he was ""fucking proud"" of what he had done. These were not the statements of a man who had come back to rationality after a temporary loss of self-control induced by the conduct of the deceased. Accordingly, I concluded that he had not lost his self-control when he inflicted the fatal injuries on the two brothers. 

16Even if, contrary to my finding, the offender had lost his self-control at the time of the killings, I found that an ordinary person confronted with the situation which met the offender that evening could not have lost self-control so as to form an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the two deceased. 

17It is for these reasons that I found that the defence of provocation had been disproved by the Crown and I entered a verdict of guilty of murder in relation to both charges. 

18The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 20 years. The standard non-parole period is generally applicable in relation to offences in the mid-range of objective seriousness, subject to matters which might aggravate or mitigate the otherwise appropriate sentence. In the present case, where the offender stands convicted of two charges of murder, there is a major question as to the extent to which the sentence in one case should be concurrent with or cumulative upon the sentence in the other case. I shall be discussing this later. 

19I turn first to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors as they relate to the offences themselves as opposed to the offender. Other than aggravating factors which are likely to be inherent in the offence of murder, there is only one matter which is potentially relevant here, namely that the offence involved two separate killings, with three shots being fired at close range at the two victims. On the other hand, the fact that there were two offences of murder and therefore two victims will be taken into account in the partial accumulation of sentences. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to also take it into account as an aggravating feature of the individual offences. 

20The single mitigating factor under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is that the offence was not a planned or pre-meditated one. 

21I think I should say a little more about this, as I am aware that the victims' family considers that it was indeed a pre-meditated offence. This is based on the proposition that it was the offender himself who threw the books through the front window of the Willis home earlier that Sunday, and then, in effect, armed himself for what he regarded as the inevitable visit that would follow from the Willis household. However, there was sworn evidence at the trial that it was not the offender but his son, Christopher Filippou Junior, who broke the front window of the Willis home that day, in retaliation for the minor damage which had been occasioned to the offender's car the night before. I have real misgivings about that evidence, which I expressed in my principal judgment. However, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I have no choice but to find that the offender knew nothing about the breaking of the window that day. It follows that there was nothing to alert the offender to the likely arrival of representatives of the Willis household. It is on this basis that I am bound to conclude that the offence was not a planned or pre-meditated one. 

22As to the origin of the revolver which fired the fatal shots, I accept the Crown's submission that for sentencing purposes I am in a form of limbo. I think it likely that it was the offender who brought the firearm to the confrontation. However, I cannot be satisfied of that matter beyond reasonable doubt, which is the standard required for an aggravating factor on sentence. By the same token, I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it was Luke Willis who presented the gun, this being the standard which is required of a mitigating factor on sentence. Accordingly, I am obliged to sentence the offender on the basis that the origin of the revolver is an unknown quantity. 

23The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the criminality or the objective seriousness in the killing of Samuel Willis is greater than that relating to the killing of Luke Willis. This is because it involved two shots, the second being fired into the victim who was already lying wounded on the ground, in a situation where the offender deliberately moved into a position to fire the second shot. This is certainly the case. Indeed it is likely that the offender realised that, despite the seriousness of Sam Willis' neck wound, it was not necessarily a fatal injury. This is the probable explanation for the fact that he then fired a further shot into Sam Willis' chest when he was lying on the ground. To this extent I accept the Crown's submission that there was an additional element of deliberation in relation to the killing of Sam Willis. However given that all three shots were fired within a very short period of time - it would seem approximately ten seconds - it is difficult to attach a great deal of significance to this factor. There was no time for any serious reflection or deliberation. 

24Mr Rosser submitted that the offences fall below the mid-range of objective seriousness. He pointed out that there were no aggravating factors other than those inherent in the offence of murder. In mitigation was the fact that the offences were not planned or pre-meditated. However, I am quite unable to find that these senseless and violent killings fall anywhere below the mid-range of objective seriousness. In my opinion that is where both of them should be categorised. 

25I now turn to say something about the offender personally. He is now 54 years old. He turned 53 on 24 June 2010, three days before he committed these offences. He is no stranger to the criminal courts. His first offences, being offences of dishonesty and drug related offences, brought him before the Children's Court when he was only 15 and then 17 years old. At the age of 18 he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and three months with a non-parole period of a little under one year for three offences of break, enter and steal together with a drug-related offence. That was in 1976, 35 years ago now. Since then he has not received any further custodial sentences. Indeed, his only convictions during those 35 years were in March 1999 when he was fined a total of $600 after pleading guilty to one charge of common assault and one of contravening an apprehended violence order. These latter convictions are particularly relevant here, for they arose out of a neighbourhood dispute between the offender and his then next door neighbour. This was the culmination of a history of problems between the two households which had led, some time earlier, to the offender and his neighbour taking out apprehended domestic violence orders against each other. The Facts Sheet in the 1999 case was tendered by the Crown before me. It shows that the offender was exhibiting a great deal of anger and aggressiveness on that occasion. Fortunately the victim was able to retaliate and force the offender to retreat, thereby avoiding any serious physical injury during the course of this confrontation. The penalty, as indicated, was a fairly minor fine. 

26Otherwise there is not a great deal of detail about the offender's life history in the material currently before the Court. He himself did not give evidence, either during the trial or on sentence. A pre-sentence report was tendered by the Crown, written by Ms J McMahon of the Probation and Parole Service, and the defence tendered a report of Dr Bruce Westmore dated 13 July 2010. This latter was prepared following an interview with the offender on 10 July 2010, less than two weeks after the offences. These two documents between them paint the following picture of the offender's background. 

27The offender was born in Sydney to Macedonian parents. He was the eldest of three brothers. He was brought up in Newcastle and apparently had an uneventful childhood, leaving school at the age of 16 years after obtaining his school certificate. He then started work at the Newcastle dockyards. This coincided with the commencement of his drug use. Between the ages of 16 and 18 years it seems he was heavily into drugs, taking anything which became available to him. It was at this stage that he committed the offences which resulted in the custodial sentences referred to earlier. 

28After his release from custody the offender's drug use apparently decreased dramatically. It was at about that time that he commenced his relationship with his wife. They were married a few years later. They have three children, currently aged between 34 and 27 years old. 

29The offender's drug use did not, however, come to a complete end with his incarceration as a young man. He continued to use cannabis from time to time until a few years ago. More significantly, he has continued to use heroin by needle, the last occasion being only two weeks before the present offences. He told Ms McMahon he generally took heroin on a monthly basis. Dr Westmore reported him as saying that he used it every one to four weeks, depending on its availability. The offender's wife and children were unaware of his continuing heroin use. Indeed, they reported him as adopting an ""anti-drug"" stance within the home. 

30The offender's alcohol use has been regular but moderate. He apparently has a routine of drinking beer and whiskey at weekends, in order to relax himself. He had been drinking immediately before he committed the present offences, but he has always denied that alcohol played any part in the events of that evening. 

31The offender has had an essentially stable employment history. He worked as an electrical fitter's assistant with the State Rail Authority for a number of years. More recently, his principal employment has been as a cleaner. At the time of these offences he had been working for about three years as cleaner and general assistant at a Newcastle primary school. The offender told Dr Westmore that he had good relationships with his co-workers. This was confirmed in the pre-sentence report. The author of the report had contacted the deputy principal of the school, who said that the offender was a reliable employee who was well-liked by both staff and students. 

32The offender and his wife Glenda have been married for 33 years. They clearly have a close relationship. Indeed the offender told both Dr Westmore and the author of the pre-sentence report that his life essentially revolved around his family, and that he did very little outside socialising. His wife and children confirmed this. Apart from work and regular visits to the TAB, they said that he used to spend virtually all his time at home. He was repeatedly described as a private person who kept very much to himself. 

33It became apparent during the course of the trial that the offender has a considerable amount of anger underlying his personality. Indeed this was, in my view, a significant factor in the commission of the present offences. His anger also manifested itself during his confrontation in 1999 with his then next-door neighbour. On the other hand, the offender told Ms McMahon that he did not like confrontation, and she observed that he did not appear to have problems with anger management at work or at home. 

34This is but one of several enigmatic aspects of the offender's life as revealed by the material before me. Another one is that, in spite of his closeness to his wife and children, he has long been alienated from his birth family: he has had no contact with his parents or at least one of his two brothers for over 14 years now. 

35The offender been less than entirely frank with the police, Dr Westmore, Ms McMahon or even his own family about some aspects of his life and of the events leading up to these offences. His family's ignorance of his heroin use is one illustration of this. In addition, when the offender recounted the history of the offences to Dr Westmore, he denied that he had written the two letters which had been left at the Willis home during the twelve months before the killings. The expert evidence given at the trial left it in no doubt, as I commented earlier, that it was the offender who wrote these letters. 

36Similarly, the offender told the police and Dr Westmore that he spent the night after the killings in his car which was parked in a Newcastle suburb. It is obvious that he wanted to avoid any reference to the friend at whose home he in fact spent the night. His family knew nothing about this friend, and he clearly wanted that situation to continue. The friend, incidentally, knew him as ""Steve Tatu"". She had never heard of Christopher Filippou. The offender gave Ms McMahon an explanation for this friendship in terms which frankly defy credulity when one has regard to the totality of the evidence. 

37It can be said of all of us that there is only one person who really knows our inner workings, and that is particularly so in the case of this offender. One thing is certain, namely that he has exhibited no remorse whatsoever for the fact that two young lives have been lost as a direct result of his actions. Indeed, more than once he sought to place the blame on the deceased brothers, saying on one occasion that they ""probably deserved what they got"". 

38The offender's lack of contrition or remorse cannot in any way be used as an aggravating factor on sentence, but it certainly deprives him of the benefit of any mitigation on that account. It is also potentially relevant to the need for personal deterrence. However, given the length of the sentences the offender will be serving in any event, and the age he is likely to be on his release, personal deterrence is of little, if any, significance in this case. 

39This brings me to a consideration of any aggravating or mitigating factors under s21A insofar as they relate to the offender personally. And so far as I can ascertain, there are none of any particular relevance here. Certainly the offender has a record of previous convictions, but they are so long ago now, and of such a different order to the current offences, that they fade into insignificance. For reasons already given, I could not say that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, but that also is of minimal importance, given the time he will be spending in custody. 

40As the Crown Prosecutor has very fairly pointed out, there is also a question as to whether the offender should be given a reduction in penalty under s 22A of the Act because of his co-operation in the presentation of evidence at his trial. As I observed in my principal judgment, considerable efficiencies were gained during the trial as a result of close co-operation between counsel as to the presentation of evidence. This resulted in a reduction in the length of the trial, and a corresponding facilitation in the administration of justice generally. This is certainly the case. However it cannot be regarded as a particularly significant matter. The principal reason why the presentation of evidence was able to be facilitated was because the trial was by judge alone, rather than by judge and jury. And it was the offender who sought to dispense with a jury, on account of the considerable adverse publicity in the local media. Moreover, when placed into the context of the lengthy sentences which the offender will be serving in any event, this matter again fades into insignificance. 

41It follows that there is very little material, either relating to the offences themselves or the offender personally, which suggests that the sentence in each case should be significantly greater or lesser than that provided by the standard non-parole period. 

42This is not to suggest that there was anything ordinary or standard about these two unprovoked killings, committed by this inherently angry man. His acts of gratuitous and senseless violence bought two promising young lives to an unnecessary and a tragically untimely end. Whatever the origin of the firearm, the two brothers were clearly unarmed when the offender fired the fatal shots at point blank range, from less than a metre away. The two young men had no chance whatsoever: they were given no warning, and no opportunity to escape. Indeed these killings were so senseless and so unnecessary that one cannot help wondering about the mental health of the perpetrator. However Dr Westmore, who saw the offender only two weeks after the offences, found no evidence of mental illness, either then or at the time of the offences. 

43The anguish and grief caused by the offender's actions is immeasurable. The offender expressed concern about the effect upon his own family, but this cannot be compared to the devastating and permanent loss suffered by the family and friends of the two victims. Luke and Sam Willis were fine young men, with diverse talents, who were just embarking on their lives and careers which were full of promise. All of this was cruelly brought to a sudden and untimely end. They were the only boys in the family, and the loss suffered by the rest of their family was graphically expressed in extremely moving victim impact statements which were read to the Court by their father, mother and sister Jessica. I would like to convey to each of them the sincere condolences of myself and of the Court. I take these statements into account in the manner provided by the legislation. 

44It goes without saying that in sentencing the offender I am taking into account the general purposes of sentencing, namely retribution, rehabilitation, the protection of the community and general deterrence. As already mentioned, individual deterrence is not a significant issue in this case, given the advanced age that the offender will be upon his release from custody. For similar reasons, it is unnecessary to consider whether there are special circumstances which might justify a departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence, notwithstanding that the partial accumulation of sentences will result in a shorter balance of term than would normally be the case. 

45For all the reasons I have given thus far, I propose to impose a non-parole period in relation to each offence of 20 years, with a balance of term of six years. That leaves outstanding the very significant question of the extent to which the sentences should be concurrent with and cumulated upon each other. 

46It goes without saying that there must be a significant degree of accumulation in the circumstances of this case. After all, one of the starting points in the sentencing process is that the offender has taken not one, but two lives. On the other hand, I must have regard to the principle of totality, and impose a sentence which reflects the fact that the two offences occurred within seconds of each other, as part of the same confrontation. Taking all these matters into account, I propose to accumulate the sentences by a period of five years. 

47The offender has been in custody since 28 June 2010, and his sentence is to commence on that date. 

48Christopher Filippou, in relation to the murder of Samuel Willis I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 20 years commencing on 28 June 2010 and expiring on 27 June 2030, with a balance of term of six years. 

49In relation to the murder of Luke Willis I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 20 years commencing on 28 June 2015 and expiring on 27 June 2035, with a balance of term of six years, commencing on 28 June 2035, and expiring on 27 June 2041. 

50The total sentence is therefore one of 31 years' imprisonment. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 27 June 2035.

2708702,Macquarie Generation v Hodgson [2011] NSWCA 424,"HEADNOTE 
The respondent brought proceedings in the Land and Environment Court (the Court) in Class 4 of its jurisdiction under the open standing provision in s 252(1) of the Pollution of the Environment Operations Act 1997 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in respect of the emission of C02 from Bayswater Power Station at Muswellbrook. Macquarie operates that 
Power Station under a licence granted by the Environment Protection Authority. Pain J summarily dismissed some of the respondent's claims [2010] NSWLEC 34. The respondent later obtained leave to amend [2011] NSWLEC 3. Macquarie's application for leave to appeal was heard as if it was an appeal. 
Macquarie challenged the jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that the respondent's allegations of offences contrary to ss 64(1) and 115(1) of the Act were not within s 252(1) because offences under those sections were not breaches of statutory duty. 
The respondent's first claim in her amended points of claim was that Macquarie's licence contained an implied or common law condition which limited its emissions of C02 to the level that would be achieved by exercising reasonable care for the environment. The respondent relied on the principle that lack of care could defeat defences of statutory authority in claims for common law nuisance. Another claim was that Macquarie had wilfully and negligently disposed of waste in the form of C02 in a manner likely to harm the environment. An injunction was sought to restrain Macquarie from burning more than 7 million tonnes of coal a year in breach of another implied term based on a statement in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in 1979. 
Held: Granting leave, and allowing the appeal: (1) The Court had jurisdiction because the offence sections created statutory duties; (2) Macquarie's licence under the Act did not contain the implied or common law condition relied on; (3) The licence did not contain an implied condition, imported from the EIS, limiting the consumption of coal at the power station. 


			Judgment 

1WHEALY JA: I agree with Handley AJA. 

2MEAGHER JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Handley AJA and with his reasons for proposing those orders. 

3HANDLEY AJA: In July 2009 the late Mr Peter Gray and Ms Naomi Hodgson commenced proceedings in the Land and Environment Court (the Court) in Class 4 of its jurisdiction against Macquarie Generation (Macquarie), a State owned Corporation, which operates Bayswater Power Station (Bayswater) at Muswellbrook. The proceedings were brought under the open standing provision in s 252(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (the Act). Their summons sought declaratory and injunctive relief in respect of the emission of carbon dioxide (C02) from Bayswater as the wilful or negligent disposal of waste contrary to s 115(1). 

4Electricity has been generated at Bayswater through the burning of coal, since March 1996 (W/B1/89), and it emitted 14.1 million tonnes of C02 in 2008. The points of claim alleged that it emitted more C02 than any other power station in the State. 

5The generation of electricity on this scale is ""a scheduled activity"", within cl 17 of Schedule 1 of the Act. Under cl 1(1) and s 48(1) a licence is required for any premises at which a scheduled activity is carried out. Such an activity is a premises-based activity within Pt 1 of the Schedule. 

6Section 48(2) makes the occupier of premises at which any scheduled activity is carried on guilty of an offence unless he is the holder of a licence ""that authorises that activity to be carried on at those premises."" Licences are granted by the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) under s 55. 

7At all relevant times Macquarie has been the holder of a licence for Bayswater which authorised the generation of more than 4000 gwh of electricity per annum from burning coal. Its licence was subject to conditions which covered, among other topics, the emission into the atmosphere of identified pollutants, but not C02, the monitoring of C02 emissions, and the disposal of solid and liquid waste. 

8The licence did not include an express condition limiting the generation of electricity, the consumption of coal, or C02 emission. Macquarie denied the existence of any implied condition limiting any of these matters. 

9Sections 64(1) relevantly provided: 

""(1) Offence 

If any condition of a licence is contravened by any person, each holder of the licence is guilty of an offence ... 

(2) The holder of a licence is not guilty of an offence against this section if the holder establishes that: 

(a)the contravention of the condition was caused by another person, and 

(b)that other person was not associated with the holder at the time the condition was contravened, and 

(c) the holder took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention of the condition ..."". 

10Section 115 relevantly provided: 

(1)Offence 

If a person wilfully or negligently disposes of waste in a manner that harms or is likely to harm the environment: 

(a)the person, and 

(b)if the person is not the owner of the waste, the owner, are each guilty of an offence. 

(2)Defence-1 awful authority 

It is a defence in any proceedings against a person for an offence under this section if the person establishes that the waste was disposed of with lawful authority. 

11Macquarie relied on its licence as lawful authority under s 115(2). 

12The Act's Dictionary defines environment as components of the earth and expressly includes air and any layer of the atmosphere. Harm to the environment is defined as including: 

""... any direct or indirect alteration of the environment that has the effect of degrading the environment and, without limiting the generality of the above, includes any act or omission that results in pollution"". 

13Pollution is defined as including air pollution, and waste is defined as including any gaseous substance ""discharged [or] emitted ... in the environment in such volume, constituency or manner as to cause an alteration in the environment..."". 

14By a motion filed on 11 September 2009, Macquarie sought summary dismissal of the proceedings under UCPR Pt 13 r 13.4(1). The applicants opposed that application and by a motion filed in November 2009 sought to amend their points of claim by introducing new paragraphs 54A and 54B. Macquarie's application was heard by Pain J (Judge). Following the delivery of reasons on 22 March 2010, the Judge ordered on 31 March 2010 that the proceedings be dismissed except for the proposed claims formulated in paragraphs 54A and 54B of the proposed amended points of claim (WB 1/251): Gray v Macquarie Generation (No 1) [2010] NSWLEC 34 (Gray No 1). By Order 2 the Judge directed the applicants to file and serve any motion seeking leave to file a further amended summons and further amended points of claim in relation to the claims made in paragraphs 54A and 54B. 

15On 15 June 2010 the applicants filed a motion for leave to further amend. That application was opposed by Macquarie and heard by the Judge on 5 August 2010. The Judge delivered reasons on 1 February 2011 and on 4 March 2011 made orders granting the applicants leave to file a further amended summons and further amended points of claim. Her reasons are: Gray v Macquarie Generation (No 3) [2011] NSWLEC 3 (Gray No 3). That interlocutory judgment is the subject of Macquarie's application for leave to appeal. 

16The Judge held that it was reasonably arguable that the authority conferred by the licence was subject to an ""implied"" or ""common law"" limitation or condition preventing Macquarie emitting C02 in excess of the level it could achieve by exercising ""reasonable regard and care for the interests of other persons and/or the environment"". It was alleged that this level had been exceeded giving rise to offences under s 64(1). Offences under the air pollution provisions in ss 124-132 were not alleged. 

17The new pleading also sought a declaration that Macquarie had wilfully and negligently disposed of waste in breach of s 115(1) by emitting C02 in a manner that harmed, or was likely to harm, the environment. An injunction was sought restraining Macquarie from burning more than an average of 7 million tonnes of coal a calendar year. 

18The Court has heard full argument on Macquarie's proposed appeal and can dispose of the case finally. At the end of the hearing of the application for leave, the Court granted leave to appeal, directed the filing of the notice of appeal, and reserved judgment. 

Jurisdiction 

19The applicant Peter Gray died while these proceedings were pending. His interest in them is not an asset of his estate and the Court ordered that his name be struck out and that the proceedings continue in the name of Naomi Hodgson. 

20The Judge held that the Court had jurisdiction under s 20 of the Land & Environment Court Act to hear cases under s 252(1), which covered the breaches of ss 64(1) and 115(1) pleaded in the proposed further amended points of claim: [88]-[89]. 

21Section 252(1) provides: 

""Any person may bring proceedings in the Land and Environment Court for an order to remedy or restrain a breach of this Act or the regulations."" 

22Mr Lancaster SC, who appeared with Mr Livingston for Macquarie, submitted that ss 64(1) and 115(1) created offences and did not impose duties and that s 252(1) only applied to breaches of statutory duty. Reference was made to the reporting duties imposed by s 148 and the duties to maintain control equipment imposed by s 167(1) and (2). The corresponding offences were created in ss 152 and 167(4). Section 129(1) also creates a duty in terms. 

23This submission should be dealt with at the outset because if it is upheld the Court below lacked jurisdiction, the applicant lacked standing, and the other points are moot. 

24Mr Lancaster relied on the statement of Lloyd J in Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Sydney Water Corporation [2004] NSWLEC 699; 138 LGERA 383, 389 [15] that proceedings under s 252 ""are brought... to enforce any public duty imposed under [the] Act"". This is clearly correct, but the question is whether statutory offences create statutory duties. 

25Mr Lloyd QC, who appeared with Mr Stafford for the applicant, relied on EPA vAlkem Drums Pty Ltd [2000] NSWCCA 416; 113 LGERA 130, 146 where Smart AJ, giving the principal judgment said, without citing authority: 

""Any statute which creates an offence, by necessary implication, imposes a duty on the person covered by its terms not to commit an offence (or a breach of the statute) by engaging in conduct which amounts to an offence."" 

26This decision was followed in Blue Mountains Conservation Society Inc v Delta Electricity [2011] NSWLEC 145 at [28], [30] where Pepper J said, after referring to s 120[27]: 

""... implicit in the words 'a person who pollutes any waters is guilty of an offence' is the imposition of a duty or obligation not to pollute waters. I do not consider... that it was necessary for the legislature to expressly state that any person 'must not' or 'shall not' pollute waters to create a duty or obligation sufficient to enliven s 252 ... To hold otherwise would be, in my opinion, to elevate absurdity above common sense."" 

27These cases are correct in principle and are supported by long-standing authority to which this Court was not referred. In Cope v Rowlands (1836) 2 M&W 149 [150 ER 707] Parke B said (at 157 [710]): 

""It is perfectly settled, that where the contract... is expressly or by implication forbidden by ... statute law, no court would lend its assistance to give it effect. It is equally clear that a contract is void if prohibited by a statute, though the statute inflicts a penalty only, because such a penalty implies a prohibition: Lord Holt, Bartlett v Vinor (1692) Carthew 252 [90 ER 750]."" 

28This passage was cited by Jacobs J in Yango Pastoral Co Pty Ltd v First Chicago Australia Ltd [1978] HCA 42; 139 CLR 410, 430. The judgment of Parke B was also cited by Gibbs ACJ (at 414, 416) and by Mason J (at 424). 

29Long-standing authority establishes the related proposition that where a statute inflicts a penalty for not doing an act ""the penalty implies that there is a legal compulsion to do the act"": Redpath v Allen (1872) LR 4 PC 511, 517; cited by Williams J in BMA v The Commonwealth [1949] HCA 44; 79 CLR 201, 289. 

30Macquarie's jurisdiction point therefore fails. 

Res Judicata and Abuse of Process 

31Macquarie also relied on issue estoppel and abuse of process based on Gray (No 1). The issue estoppel fails because the decision in Gray (No 1) was interlocutory and not final. In Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34; 220 CLR 363, 375 the Court said: 

""A 'final' decision ... is one which is not of an interlocutory character... it must be final and conclusive on the merits ..."". 

32The decision on an application for summary dismissal does not finally decide any question: Spencer Bower and Handley ""Res Judicata"" 4th ed 2009 at pp 82, 84-5, 86-7. 

33In any event Gray (No 1) did not decide that Macquarie's licence was unlimited. 

34There was no abuse of process in seeking leave to file the further amended points of claim. The applicant was not making a second application for the same relief on the same grounds. The first application had been by Macquarie. The second, dealt with by Gray (No 3) was for leave to plead a narrower case that had not been fully considered in Gray (No 1). 

Implied condition 

35The applicant's case that Macquarie's licence contained an implied condition limiting the emission of C02 depended on the principle that negligence would ordinarily defeat a defence of statutory authority to a claim in nuisance. The principle was stated by Lord Wilberforce with his customary lucidity in Allen v Gulf Oil Ltd [1981] AC 1001, at 1011: 

""We are here in the well charted field of statutory authority. It is now well settled that where Parliament by express direction or by necessary implication has authorised the construction and use of an undertaking or works, that carries with it an authority to do what is authorised with immunity from any action based on nuisance. The right of action is taken away ... To this there is made the qualification, or condition, that the statutory powers are exercised without 'negligence' - that word here being used in a special sense so as to require the undertaker, as a condition of obtaining immunity from action, to carry out the work and conduct the operation with all reasonable regard and care for the interests of other persons ... It is within the same principle that immunity from action is withheld where the terms of the statute are permissive only, in which case the powers conferred must be exercised in strict conformity with private rights."" 

36The authority cited for the qualification in the last sentence, Metropolitan Asylum District v Hill (1881) 6 App Cas 193, should not be misunderstood. In that case the Board's powers were expressed in general terms without reference to the site in question. 

37In Allen v Gulf Oil Ltd (above) Lord Diplock said at 1014: 

""Clearly the intention of Parliament was that the refinery was to be operated as such, and ... in Metropolitan Asylum District v Hill... all three members of this House who took part in the decision would apparently have reached the conclusion that the nuisance caused by the small-pox hospital could not have been the subject of an action, if the hospital had been built upon a site which the Board had been granted power by Act of Parliament to acquire compulsorily for that specific purpose."" 

38In the same case Lord Edmund-Davies said at 1016: 

""... it was ... a necessary implication of the Act that the company was thereby authorised to construct and operate the refinery which they in fact later constructed and operated ... and in acting as it did the company took and used the land for the sole purpose for which a power of compulsory acquisition had been conferred on it."" 

39Thus the principle in Metropolitan Asylum District v Hill (above) does not apply where statutory authority has been given for an undertaking on the particular site. This is confirmed by Hammersmith and City Railway Co v Brand (1869) LR 4 HL 171, 202, 215; and Manchester Corporation v Farnworth [1930] AC 171, 183, 199, 202. 

40The defence failed in Tate & Lyle Industries Ltd v Greater London Council [1983] 2 AC 509, 537-8 because the Council did not prove that its ferry wharves had been constructed with all reasonable regard and care for the interests of others. 

41Those cases were applied in Van Son v Forestry Commission of New South Wales (1995) 86 LGERA 108, 129-30 where reference was made to Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board v OK Elliott Ltd [1934] HCA 57; 52 CLR 134, 143. 

42Those cases dealt with ""statutory authority"" as a defence to an action in tort where the question is whether the plaintiff's common law right has been taken away by the statute. There is no common law tort for causing harm ""to the environment"" which does not interfere with the rights of individuals. 

43The applicant seeks to enforce statutory rights, and the question is whether the licence contains the implied term relied on. That depends on the true construction of the statute and the licence. Common law rights are not relevant. 

44The limits on statutory immunity from liability in tort cannot apply to proceedings under a statute which do not invoke common law rights. 

45The applicant does not allege that C02 emissions from Bayswater have caused an actionable nuisance. This is not surprising because C02 is colourless, odourless and inert, and the Court has no jurisdiction in actions in tort. 

46The C02 emissions may not have caused an actionable nuisance to anyone and proceedings in tort may have failed on their merits. In those circumstances it would be remarkable if proceedings under the Act based on this implied common law condition could succeed. 

47In short the so-called ""common law principles"" protect private rights and are irrelevant if they have not been infringed. 

48The first question must be whether the asserted implied condition is consistent with the statutory scheme. 

49Section 53 provides that applications for this type of licence are made to the EPA as the regulatory authority (s 6). It may grant or refuse the licence but must take into consideration the applicant's submissions (s 55). The Act does not allow third parties to participate. 

50The EPA may issue a licence unconditionally or subject to conditions (s 63(1)). It may vary a licence or its conditions (s 58(1)), on its own initiative or on the application of the holder (s 58(3)). If ""the variation will authorise a significant increase in the environmental impact of the activity authorised or controlled by the licence"" the EPA ""is to invite and consider public submissions before it varies the licence"" (s 58(6)). A licence continues until it is suspended, revoked or surrendered (s 77(1)). 

51The EPA is required to review each licence at intervals not exceeding 5 years (s 78(1)). A licence may be suspended or revoked on specified grounds (s 79) which include contravention of a condition (s 79(5)(b)). 

52The EPA may exempt any person from any provision of the Act (s 284(2)(b)) if satisfied that it is not practicable to comply with that provision or that non-compliance will not have any significant adverse effect on public health or the environment. It may revoke or vary any such exemption (s 284(7)). 

53Section 287(1 )(b) enables an applicant for a licence, or its holder to appeal from a decision of the EPA to the Court. The Act does not provide for third parties to participate. 

54The implied condition relied on was not imposed by the EPA and Macquarie could not appeal against its imposition. If it was a condition within s 64(1) the EPA could remove it. If it was not within that section its contravention would not be an offence under s 64(1) and it could not be enforced under s 252(1). Its anomalous nature is apparent. 

55A licence under the Act is a unilateral instrument, but its terms may reflect a compromise between what is desirable and what is practicable. 

56A decision that a contract contains an ad hoc implied term is an exercise in its interpretation: Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of A/SI/I/[1982] HCA 24; 149 CLR 337, 345 per Mason J. 

57The recognition of such a term in a licence under this Act must also be an exercise in its interpretation. 

58The cover page of the current licence (WB 2/264) issued on 1 December 2008, identified the Scheduled Activity (i.e. Schedule 1) as ""Electricity generation"" and ""Waste Activities"", and the ""Fee Based Activity"" (s 57) as including Waste generation and ""generation of electrical power from coal"" in excess of 4000 gwh. This reproduced the substantive condition in cl A1.2 which contained those details and provided (WB 2/268): 

""This licence authorises the carrying out of the scheduled activities listed below at the premises specified in A2. The activities are listed according to the scheduled activity classification, fee-based activity classification and the scale of the operation. Unless otherwise further restricted by a condition of this licence, the scale at which the activity is carried out must not exceed the maximum scale specified in this condition."" 

59The only maximum specified was that ""Hazardous Industrial or Group Waste Generation or Storage"" must not exceed 100 tonnes. Condition A4.1 provided that""... activities must be carried out in accordance with the proposal contained in the licence application, except as expressly provided by a condition of this licence."" The applicant did not rely on anything in Macquarie's licence application to restrict the generality of the licence or support the implication relied on. 

60The ""Limit conditions"" (L1-L4) dealt with the load and concentration limits on ""Assessable Pollutant(s)"" discharged to the air. Condition L5 dealt with the solid or liquid waste generated on the premises (WB 2/277). The Monitoring and recording conditions required Macquarie to monitor the discharge of identified ""pollutants"" at various points at Bayswater, and to record and retain the results (M1.1). Its monitoring obligation with respect to C02, identified as a pollutant (WB 2/21-2), was to do so yearly. There were no load or concentration limits for C02. 

61The express conditions did not limit electricity generation, coal consumption, or C02 emissions. The question is whether any implied limitation can be identified by construing the licence. The requirements for the implication of an unexpressed ad hoc term in a contract were summarised by the Privy Council in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266, 283: 

""... for a term to the implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied: (1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that 'it goes without saying'; (4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract."" 

62This summary was approved in Codelfa (above) at pp 347, 351, 403, 404, and 405, and has been cited by the High Court in later cases. 

63I see no reason why these principles should not apply by analogy to the implication of a term in a statutory licence, making due allowance for the differences the nature of the instruments. The requirements for the implication to be necessary, obvious, clear, and consistent with the express terms appear to be relevant. 

64The licence allows Macquarie to generate more than 4000 gwh of electricity each year from the burning of coal. The licence may not authorise the creation of a nuisance but this would not depend on quantitative limitations on production, consumption, or emissions but on proof of the nuisance. The fact, if it be the fact, that the licence would not authorise a nuisance cannot matter if there is no nuisance. 

65On its face the licence, is relevantly unrestricted. It is not necessary to imply any condition to make it effective, and the condition relied on would contradict the licence. 

66On the other hand it was necessary to imply a term permitting Macquarie to emit C02 because a licence to burn coal would otherwise be ineffective. 

67The implied condition should be rejected and that disposes of the claim under s 64(1). 

CQ2 as waste 

68The applicant also had a claim that C02 is waste within s 115(1), and Macquarie did not have a defence of lawful authority under s 115(2). 

69The claim struck out in Gray (No 1) was that Macquarie was in breach of s 115(1) because it had no lawful authority to emit waste in the form of C02. The claim that survived challenge in Gray (No 3) was that Macquarie did not have lawful authority under s 115(2) for emissions in excess of the level imposed by the implied condition [12], [13], [15], [62], [69], [78]. 

70Rejection of the implied condition disposes of this part of the case as well, and it is not necessary to determine whether C02 is waste within s 115(1). 

Implied condition limiting the consumption of coal 

71The claim that the licence contained an implied condition limiting coal consumption to 7 million tonnes a year was based on the development consent under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act obtained by Macquarie's predecessor from Muswellbrook Shire Council on 18 September 1980. This stated (WB 2/294): 

""... Council has agreed to the proposal by the Electricity Commission ... for the development of Bayswater Power station as described in the environmental impact statement and supplementary information volume dated June 1979 ..."". 

72The environmental impact statement (EIS) (WB 2/296) comprised 76 pages, and the supplementary information volume contained a further 66. The former included the following (WB 2/317): 

"" Coal Supply System 
The first stage of the station comprising Units 1 and 2 will require up to 3.5 million tonnes of coal per annum ... construction of Units 3 and 4 to bring the station to its full 2640 MW capacity will increase requirements up to 7 million tonnes of coal per annum."" 

73The consent did not contain an express condition limiting coal consumption to 7 million tonnes a year. That condition, based on a few lines in the EIS, could not be implied by a process of incorporation. 

74Section 45(1 )(i) requires the EPA to take into consideration, so far as relevant, when exercising its licensing functions, fourteen matters, including in connection with a licence application: 

""- any relevant environmental impact statement, or other statement of environmental effects, prepared or obtained by the applicant under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979."" 

75The Act does not provide for the automatic incorporation of an EIS, or any part of it, in a licence. 

76The EPA must take the EIS into consideration, along with the other thirteen matters listed in s 45(1), and it should be inferred that it did. The absence of an express condition limiting coal consumption to 7 million tonnes indicates that it decided not to incorporate that in the licence. That decision was for the EPA and not the Court. 

77It would be remarkable if a few lines from an EIS and supplementary material of 142 pages prepared in 1979, which did not become a condition in the development consent, should be an implied term of a licence under the Act granted in 2008. 

78The licence authorises the generation of electricity in excess of 4000 gwh a year, but the EIS contemplated a ""capacity"" of 2640 MW. The evidence does not elucidate the relationship between these figures. 

79For these reasons, the claimed implied condition limiting coal consumption to 7M tonnes a year also should be rejected. 

Conclusion 

80In my opinion therefore the appeal should be allowed. Mr Lloyd did not seek an opportunity to replead the applicant's case and, in any event, the decision on the construction of Macquarie's licence forecloses further reliance on ss 64(1), 115(1), and 252(1). 

81The following orders, which are additional to those in [18] should be made: 

(1)Appeal allowed with costs; 

(2)Orders 1 and 2 made by Pain J on 4 March 2011 be set aside; 

(3)In lieu thereof, order that the applicant's notice of motion of 15 June 2010 be dismissed with costs; 

(4)Order that the applicant's amended summons be dismissed with costs, but not so as to disturb any existing orders for costs in favour of the applicant; 

(5)The respondent to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act.

		22 December 2011",2011-12-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2708715,"McLEAN, Michael v R [2011] NSWCCA 273","Judgment 

1THE COURT : On 20 July 2011, the Court made orders allowing the appellant's appeal, setting aside his conviction and directing an acquittal. These are the reasons for those orders. 

2The appellant was tried by a jury before a judge of the District Court at Parramatta between 31 August and 10 September 2009, on a single count of robbery whilst in the company of unknown persons contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 97(1). 

3He was found guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and four months with a non-parole period of four years and four months. 

4The ground of the appeal was that the trial miscarried as the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1). 

5There was no issue as to the operative legal principle to apply to dispose of the appeal. Whilst the Court has due regard to both the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the evidence and the primacy of the jury verdict, it makes its own independent assessment of the quality and sufficiency of the whole of the evidence at the trial and determines for itself whether there was a reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the appellant: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 571 at [11]-[14], [20]-[25], [37], [40]-[48] and [78]-[80]; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487. 

6The relevant facts from and concerning the trial can be shortly stated as follows. At about 3.50 pm on 24 March 2009, Easter Monday afternoon, three men attended Medusa Jewellers on Church Street at Parramatta. One man stood outside the store, while the two other males entered, having been admitted by the owner Mr Nathan Sobbi who released the door lock. Mr Sobbi's evidence was that while examining jewellery one of the two offenders in the shop lifted his shirt to reveal a gun. Mr Sobbi was directed to comply with directions of this man to open the display cabinets. He was then taken to the back of the store, where the safes were opened. This man demanded the CCTV recordings which were given to him. Mr Sobbi was then tied up. Some time later, he set off an alarm and rang the police. His shop had, of course, been robbed. 

7When the police arrived swabs were taken from arm marks on the glass counter. 

8The appellant had the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from one of the swabs at the scene. 

9There are a number of aspects of the evidence which persuaded us that there was a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt. 

10The first aspect was the description of the two men. The man who showed the gun to Mr Sobbi was said to be of ""Australian"" appearance and to have a tattoo on his neck. The appellant does not have a tattoo on his neck. The second man was said to be wearing an Hawaiian shirt with short sleeves and sunglasses. No mention was made of any tattoos. The appellant has prominent tattoos on his forearms. Mr Sobbi, who is Persian, also described the second man in the shop as ""Middle Eastern, could be Lebanese people or Egyptian or Persian people"". He described the third man outside similarly. The appellant is not of those ethnic descriptions. 

11Thus, not only was there no identification evidence implicating the appellant at the store in the company of the two other men at the time of the robbery, but also such evidence as there was raised a doubt as to the likelihood of the appellant being one of the men. 

12The DNA evidence was the only evidence linking the accused with the crime. Whilst the appellant's counsel put detailed written submissions on DNA evidence, his argument on appeal ultimately did not challenge the reliability of the scientific evidence. There is no call, therefore, to deal with any of the cases on DNA evidence. 

13It was necessary therefore for the balance of the evidence to be sufficient to leave no reasonable doubt that the DNA was left by the appellant in the shop during the robbery. 

14Three bodies of evidence were relevant to this factual issue: the record of interview of the appellant with the police, the evidence of the cleaning of the glass counter by Mr Sobbi on which the swab was found, and the evidence of who may have entered the shop that day and in days before. 

15The interview was conducted some ten months after the robbery. It is unnecessary to set out the whole of the relevant terms of the interview. Crucial to the case of the prosecution was the obtaining of a clear denial by the appellant that he had ever been in this shop. An edited version of the ERISP and the DVD of the edited version were in evidence. The transcript as a whole is simply an inadequate basis to conclude that there was any clear denial ofhis being in this shop at any time. The shop was inadequately, and to a degree inaccurately, described by the police at the interview and the denial, such as it was, was equivocal. 

16We should add at this point that we raised with counsel at the appeal the possibility that the trial miscarried by inadequate representation because of what could be seen to have been agreed to be excised from the transcript exhibit. This matter did not have to be addressed because we came to the firm view that the evidence as led admitted necessarily of a reasonable doubt. 

17The evidence of Mr Sobbi as to when he cleaned the glass was connected with his evidence of trading on the day in question and of his usual practice. The shop had been closed on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday previously. During the course of a normal trading day he would clean the glass at least four times a day with window cleaner and cloth. On the day in question, he opened at 10.30 am. He would usually clean the cabinets at the beginning of the day. The evidence was not taken from any particular recollection, but from his usual practice. 

18Mr Sobbi gave evidence that there were customers that day, before the robbery. Mr Sobbi could not remember them. The evidence was insufficient to conclude that the door was locked all day. Sometimes he left it open, enabling people to walk in. 

19From this material there was no basis to conclude that the appellant did not visit the shop in the morning or early afternoon of the day in question. Though it is unlikely, given the practice of Mr Sobbi as to cleaning, it was possible that the DNA was left the previous week. Even if that can be discounted there was ample time for the appellant to have visited the shop that day. The ERISP did not, with any clarity at all, eliminate that reasonable possibility. 

20When one combines the above with the disconformities in identification - the lack of tattoo identification and the ethnicity identification, we were persuaded that the doubt about the conviction was reason

		16 December 2011",2011-12-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708726,Tattersall v R [2011] NSWCCA 282,"Judgment  1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of detaining Steven Jiminez without his consent and with intent to obtain an advantage, namely psychological, and at the time of detaining, actual bodily harm was occasioned to Jiminez. The offence was contrary to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the maximum penalty being 25 years imprisonment.  2The sentencing judge was also required to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of deem supply of a prohibited drug, being 5.3 grams of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1995 (NSW).  3The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 14 years and 5 months comprising a non-parole period of 11 years with a balance of term of 3 years and 5 months. There are two grounds of appeal being:  Ground 1: the sentencing judge erred in having regard to material that was not in evidence before him.  Ground 2: the sentence is manifestly excessive.  4The facts were not in dispute and are as follows:  5The co-offender Nadia Donn befriended a woman called Amanda Sutton in 2006. Both had interests in common and through those interests met the applicant. Sutton became involved in a relationship with the applicant and they moved into a house together. The victim in this matter is Stephen Jimenez. At about this time he was living in Nowra and befriended the co-offenders being Ben Thomas and his girlfriend Nadia Donn. Donn and Thomas introduced Jimenez to Sutton and the applicant. Jimenez eventually moved to Warilla, a suburb of Wollongong.  6Shortly thereafter the applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. Donn spent a lot of time with Sutton whilst the applicant was in custody. She encouraged Sutton to take up with Jimenez and before long Sutton and Jimenez developed a casual sexual relationship. The applicant was released from custody on 20 February 2010 and stayed in a caravan in his brother's backyard in Nowra. At this time Donn fell out with Sutton and told the applicant's brother about Sutton's sexual relationship with Stephen Jimenez. She expected that information to get back to the applicant.  7At about 9pm on Monday 22 February 2010 the applicant arrived at Donn's house. The applicant asked Thomas if he had been ""rooting Sutton"". Donn said ""No it was junior, Stephen (being the victim) and Dwayne"". The applicant directed Donn and Thomas to attend his caravan. When they got there the applicant took Jimenez's number from Donn's phone. The applicant called the number. Donn and Thomas heard the applicant talking to someone on the phone and becoming very agitated. He appeared to be speaking to someone called Rob. At the time the victim Jimenez was visiting Rob Menz at William Avenue, Warilla. At about 9.30pm Jimenez's mobile phone rang. Menz picked it up and answered. He heard a male voice ask ""Where's Amanda?"" Menz replied ""Hang on buddy, this is not Stephen, I just answered his phone"". The male then said ""I'm looking for Amanda. Is Stephen with Amanda? I just got out of gaol, I don't even have any clothes, I want to know where my things are"". Menz replied ""No they haven't been together since new year"". The male asked ""Where is he?"" Menz replied ""Dunno"".  8The phone rang again and was answered this time by Jimenez. The male asked ""Where are you?"" Jimenez replied ""In Fairy Meadow"". The male said:  ""Were you with my missus cunt? I'm coming to get you. You're not at Fairy Meadow are you cunt, you're at William Street aren't you cunt. Stay put I'm coming to get you cunt. I'll be there in twenty minutes, I'm leaving now"".  9The applicant then directed Donn and Thomas to pick up Jimenez. They were joined by another co-offender Shaun Burne. Donn drove the three of them back to her house where they changed cars and then Thomas drove them to William Avenue, Warilla in his Mitsubishi Magna station wagon. In the meantime Jimenez drove to Warilla Police Station to report the applicant's threat. H e returned to Menz's home in William Avenue. While he was there he received a call from a male calling himself ""Jason."" The male said he would be at the house in twenty minutes. Jimenez went and sat in his car so that he could drive to the police station if need be. He waited for an hour and then phoned Donn. The male who called himself ""Jason"" answered the phone. He confirmed that they were on their way and said ""You want to be there cunt"".  10Shortly thereafter Jimenez heard a car pull up in the street. He saw Donn and Thomas sitting in Thomas's Magna station wagon. He also saw another male in the back seat of the car. Donn and Thomas saw him and yelled out ""Are you coming or what?"" Jimenez replied, ""I don't know, who is that?"" Burne replied, ""I'm Shaun, Jason's cousin. Are you going to get in the car? The longer you keep Jason waiting the shiftier he gets.""  11Jimenez then agreed to follow them in his red Daihatsu Charade. They travelled in convoy to Albion Park. At one point Jimenez phoned Donn to ask where they were going. Thomas answered the phone and told him ""Jason is already at a house and he's waiting for us. We are driving there"". Jimenez said ""I want to meet in a public place"". Thomas replied ""We can't do that, it will make him more shitty. You are better off just going there"".  12When they arrived at Albion Park both cars stopped and Burne got into Jimenez's car. They then drove to the home of the co-offender Matthew Bool and Stephanie Ireland at 5 Murragan Street, Albion Park Rail. The applicant had earlier phoned Bool to tell him that he was coming over to his house with a couple of his mates. He turned up on his motorbike at about midnight. Once inside he told Bool and Ireland, ""I've got something to do. We got to go fucking sort this fellow out"".  13The others arrived a short time later. They were met by the applicant who said to Jimenez ""Get in here now cunt"". Jimenez walked into the house. He was followed closely by Thomas, Donn and Burne. The applicant punched him in the head as he walked past. Jimenez was then told to stand in the kitchen area and was then punched causing him to fall to the floor. He was then punched and kicked by the applicant as Thomas, Donn and Burne sat around the kitchen area watching. At some point the applicant told Thomas to get a baseball bat from the car. Thomas left and then returned with a baseball bat. The applicant started to hit Jimenez with the baseball bat and then he continued to hit and kick the victim whilst the others watched.  14At one point Jimenez heard something crack in his left ankle and felt a burst of intense pain in his left leg. He screamed and was told by the applicant to ""Shut the fuck up, you're going to wake up the kids"". There were five children in the house aged two, four, six, ten and eleven. They were sleeping in the back bedroom. Ireland checked on the children about eight or nine times during the night, otherwise she remained with the others.  15A little while later the applicant told Jimenez to get up and go out to the backyard. Jimenez picked himself up from the kitchen floor and limped out to the backyard. Once outside the applicant screamed at Jimenez, ""Have you learnt your lesson cunt. I'm going to overdose you on heroin and leave you to die cunt"". The applicant started hitting him with a baseball bat again. Jimenez fell to the ground. After a time the applicant said, ""That's what a dirty cunt gets"".  16At this point the offender Shaun Burne said ""It's my turn now, it's my turn now"". The applicant made Jimenez stand up. Burne then punched Jimenez about five times and then kicked him in the ribs. Jimenez fell to the ground again. Burne then said, ""Get back inside you dumb little cunt"". Back inside the house the applicant asked Bool to get his tattoo gun so that he could write ""dog"" on Jimenez's forehead. Ireland got the tattoo gun and gave it to Bool who in turn set it up and gave it to the applicant. Jimenez was made to lie on the kitchen floor as the applicant used his right hand to tattoo the word ""dog"" on his forehead. He took about ten minutes. Burne was standing nearby. Donn, Thomas and Bool were sitting nearby.  17When the applicant was finished tattooing Jimenez's forehead he and Burne again hit Jimenez. Donn was sitting nearby looking at a tattoo book. The applicant made a number of telephone calls to Robert Menz during the early hours of that morning. During the calls Menz could hear Jimenez getting ""flogged"". At one point the applicant said, ""Your mate's having fun here, you're next, this is going to happen to you"". Jimenez was also forced to sign over ownership of his Daihatsu Charade to the applicant. The document to be signed was prepared by Donn. Thomas drove the vehicle away from the scene in an attempt to conceal it.  18Jimenez was then taken out to the backyard in the early hours of the morning. Bool directed him to sit on a chair in the carport. The applicant asked him, ""What are you meant to say now cunt?"" Jimenez replied, ""Thank you for stopping and I'm sorry for what I've done"". Some time later the applicant said to Jimenez:  ""Ben and Nadia are going to take you to a Sydney hospital. This is what you are going to say. You got bashed by five or six wogs in a park and that you signed your car over to a friend earlier today and Ben and Nadia found you in a park. I will kill you and come after your family if you tell the cops"".  19At about 7.30am Donn and Thomas drove Jimenez to Wollongong Hospital in Thomas' car. With his significant injuries Jimenez had difficulty walking so Donn and Thomas helped him into the hospital and left him with the triage nurse. They then drove to Campbelltown trying to find the address of the person referred to as ""junior"" for the applicant. The applicant left about twenty minutes after Thomas and Donn. He phoned Bool some time later and told him to get rid of the tattoo gun. Ireland took the tattoo gun and put it into a friend's garbage bin.  20At about 11am Donn and Thomas stopped at 5 Murragan Street on their way back from Campbelltown and picked up the baseball bat. They were joined by Bool and Burne. They then went to the place where Thomas had concealed Jimenez's Daihatsu Charade. Thomas drove the Charade to Kiama bends lookout where he dumped it and was then picked up by Donn, Bool and Burne and driven home to Nowra.  21Jimenez was examined at Wollongong Hospital. He had a painful left ankle, left forearm and right elbow. X-rays revealed a fractured left ankle. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left ankle on 26 February 2010 and it was put into a back slab. The injury was consistent with a direct blow to the ankle and surgery was required. He also had the word ""dog"" tattooed on his forehead in green ink.  22Dr Angelo Tsirbas, an ocular plastic surgeon reported that the victim has a severe disability in the vision of his left eye so as to be classed as legally blind in that eye.  23The sentencing judge described the factual circumstances as demonstrating ""the sickening nature of the offence."" His Honour was satisfied that the offender organised for several of his co-offenders to bring the victim to the premises in Murragan Street. Once inside the victim who was 18 years of age was outnumbered and vulnerable. His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender then subjected the victim to a brutal bashing that commenced shortly after midnight and did not end until he was taken to the hospital at 7.30 am. Part of the brutality included a threat by the offender that he would be overdosed and left to die. The offender threatened the victim indicating that he and his family would be killed if he spoke to the police. The sentencing judge found that the offence was aggravated by a number of factors including the actual use of a weapon (the baseball bat) and that gratuitous cruelty was involved. His Honour also regarded the use of the tattoo gun as an aggravating feature. His Honour was satisfied that the victim suffered substantial injury and emotional harm well in excess of the actual bodily harm which his Honour described as an element of the offence. His Honour said:  ""During the period of about 7 hours, so completely broken was the spirit of the victim, that he ultimately told the offender what he believed the offender wanted to hear.""  24His Honour was also satisfied that:  ""Callous and calculating nature of the offending conduct was further demonstrated in the act of the offender telephoning Robert Menz, the victim's friend, so he could hear the screams of the victim in the background and threatening Menz this was going to happen to him.""  25His Honour found that the applicant was the ring leader of the criminal enterprise and that his co-offenders were in fear of him and concerned for their own safety if they opposed the applicant's actions. His Honour concluded that the case fell just outside the worst category of offence of its kind, but, mindful of the fact that the applicant had ordered his co-offenders to take the victim to hospital ultimately concluded that the offence ""falls towards the very high end of the range but just short of worst case category.""  26The applicant was aged 35 at the time of sentencing. He has a criminal record for a variety of offences including common assault, custody of a knife in a public place, contravening an apprehended violence order and driving whilst disqualified. He has on previous occasions breached his parole conditions. Following his previous incarceration he was released from custody on 20 February 2010. The offences the subject of the present proceedings were committed 2 days later.  27The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant's conduct ""displayed a viciousness and callousness not often seen."" His Honour said that ""when giving evidence I did not detect any feeling of sympathy for the victim's suffering during the offence or indeed empathy for the continuing psychological damage the victim would experience in the future."" His Honour concluded that he was unable to make a finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation nor that he would be unlikely to re-offend.  28The applicant pleaded guilty and although the plea was entered at a relatively late stage his Honour allowed a discount of 10% for the utilitarian value of the plea. His Honour was not persuaded that there were special circumstances.  Ground 1: To that extent the trial judge's summary of the defence case was also inadequate.  29Under this ground of appeal the applicant challenges the sentencing judge's finding that the applicant was the ring leader and that his co-offenders were afraid for their own safety. It was submitted that the evidence could not support these findings and furthermore that the propositions were not put to the applicant during the course of his cross examination. It was submitted that accordingly his Honour erred in having regard to these matters in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence.  30The sentencing judge was also responsible for sentencing the applicant's co-offenders. In the remarks on sentence for those offenders his Honour indicated that he was satisfied that each of the co-offenders had been afraid of the applicant at the time of the offence. It is apparent from the transcript of the hearing in relation to the applicant that when he gave evidence he was asked questions by his own counsel in which he acknowledged that he knew from the Crown case statement and from the material that his co-offenders tendered in their own proceedings, that the other offenders had said they were fearful of the applicant at the time Mr Jiminez was detained. In the course of submissions in this Court the applicant's counsel acknowledged that his Honour had sentenced the other offenders and was accordingly familiar with the circumstances of the offence. It was implicit if not expressed that counsel acknowledged that his Honour could have regard to his findings in the other proceedings when sentencing the applicant. Counsel acknowledged that he could not submit that the applicant should be sentenced at the level of the other offenders indicating ""that's clearly not an available submission, his role is significantly greater than that of the others who have been previously sentenced."" Counsel also acknowledged that his client had ""an extensive criminal history, extending over many years.""  31In these circumstances I am satisfied it was plain to the applicant's counsel that after having regard to all of the evidentiary material which counsel acknowledged was available to the sentencing judge his Honour would find that the applicant was the ring leader of the enterprise and that the co-offenders had participated because of threats made against them by the applicant. I am not satisfied that his Honour erred and would reject ground 1 of the appeal.  Ground 2: the sentence is manifestly excessive  32There can be no doubt that the applicant committed a very serious offence. The victim was seriously injured in the course of the events and has been left legally blind in his left eye. He was brutally bashed with a baseball bat and detained for more than 7 hours. Apart from the physical injuries he was threatened with death. Death threats were also made against his family if the matter was reported to the police.  33Apart from the other substantial physical injuries and emotional harm the applicant inflicted a large tattoo of the word ""dog"" on the victim's forehead. The applicant was the ring leader of the enterprise.  34The applicant said he committed the offence because he had felt ""a bit upset"" when he learned of the sexual relationship between his former partner and the victim. He also said that he was ""off his head"" on drugs or alcohol at the time. To my mind neither of these matters justified or ameliorated the seriousness of the offence. Apart from the primary offence his Honour also had to have regard to the matter on the Form 1. The offence was committed within 2 days of the applicant being released from custody having previously breached his parole. His objective circumstances include a criminal history which demonstrate persistent disregard for the law. The sentencing judge was not satisfied that the applicant would not re-offend.  35In all of these circumstances I am not persuaded that the sentence which his Honour imposed was erroneously excessive.  36In the result I am of the opinion that the applicant's application was entirely without merit. I would refuse leave to appeal.  37LATHAM J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  38HARRISON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  **********

		09 February 2012",2011-12-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708727,Fong v R [2011] NSWCCA 283,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with Simpson J. 

2SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 4 November 2010, following his plea of guilty to a single charge of supplying heroin on an ongoing basis, brought under s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (""the DMT Act ""). That subsection prescribes a maximum custodial penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. The applicant also asked that two further offences on a Form 1 be taken into account, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act ""): these were offences of supplying heroin and of possessing heroin. 

3Freeman DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 5 years and 3 months, commencing on 18 April 2009, and expiring on 17 July 2014, with a non-parole period of 3 years, which will expire on 17 April 2012. 

4In so sentencing the applicant, his Honour allowed a reduction of 25% in the sentence he otherwise would have imposed, in recognition of the applicant's early plea of guilty: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. He found, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act , that special circumstances existed justifying departure from the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period there specified. The reduction made in the non-parole period was very considerable: on the statutory proportions, a head sentence of 5 years and 3 months would carry a non-parole period of just under 4 years. 

5The applicant stood for sentence with two co-offenders, David Chow, and Jason Wong (also known as Jian Be Huang). Chow and Wong were both charged with, and pleaded guilty to, knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin). That offence also attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, but, additionally, it is subject to a standard non-parole period of 10 years: see Sentencing Procedure Act , Part 4, Division 1A. Each asked that a further offence on a Form 1 be taken into account; this was an offence of dealing in the proceeds of crime (""money-laundering""), that being the sum of more than $480,000 found to be under their control at the time of their arrest. 

6Wong was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 1/2 years, with a non-parole period of 5 years; Chow was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. 

The facts 

7The facts were put before the sentencing judge by way of an agreed statement of facts that related to each of the three offenders. The three men were involved in an organised enterprise of the supply of heroin, which operated from residential premises in Erskineville. 

8In the introductory paragraphs to the statement of facts, both Chow and Wong were said to have: 

""... knowingly [taken] part in the ongoing distribution of heroin from the premises ... and [to have been] involved in all facets of the operation."" 

9The applicant was said to have: 

""... supplied on behalf of the distribution network and [to have been aware he was operating in a well-organised enterprise with access to large amounts of heroin. ... [and to have had] the key to [a safe] ... which contained a quantity of heroin."" 

10Heroin was packaged in the Erskineville premises, and sold on the streets of Surry Hills. Typically, the three offenders attended at the Erskineville address, arriving in separate vehicles. After, presumably, packaging the drugs, they would then leave in one car and travel to Surry Hills, where they would pick up customers, drive them a short distance, supply the drug, and take their money. 

11Section 25A of the DMT Act requires proof of a supply on three or more separate occasions during any period of 30 consecutive days. Established against the applicant were five separate supplies, on 3 April, 7 April, 9 April, 11 April and 14 April 2009. 

12The enterprise had been under surveillance, and on each of these occasions the applicant (or one of his co-offenders, as part of a joint criminal enterprise) supplied the drug to a registered police ""source"" who was working in conjunction with police officers. 

13On the first occasion, by prior arrangement, the applicant and Wong met the source on a Surry Hills street; they introduced themselves, and drove off with him in a vehicle. Some negotiations concerning the quantity of drug that they could supply took place. Within a short time on that date, in two separate transactions, the source paid Wong $750, and Wong handed to the source two packages of heroin, with a total weight of 0.83 grams and a purity of 65%. The applicant was present throughout, and was the driver of the vehicle. 

14During some of the discussion, the source inquired about obtaining ""an eight ball"". Wong told him that ""an eight ball"" cost $2,150, and would take about an hour to obtain. He gave the source a code to use when telephoning to placing such an order. 

15When giving the source the second package, Wong told him that it was not his usual practice to hand over the drug until immediately before the customer left the car, because, if he (Wong) became aware of the presence of police, he could ""get rid of"" the drug, whereas heroin addicts were more likely to retain it and therefore provide evidence that would incriminate them. 

16On the second occasion, 7 April, the source telephoned the applicant and used the code he had been given by Wong for requesting supply of an ""eight ball"". The applicant picked up the source. They had a conversation about the high quality of the drug being supplied. The applicant gave the source an alternative code for requesting an ""eight ball"". Eventually, the applicant handed the source a bag containing 3.41 grams of heroin, with a purity of 65%. The source handed him $2,150. 

17On the subsequent three occasions, a similar pattern operated. The applicant, or one of his co-offenders, was handed by the source sums of $2,150 (on two occasions) and $950 (on the last occasion) and received, respectively, 3.28 grams of heroin with a purity of 67.5%, 3.3 grams with a like purity, and 1.13 grams, also with a purity of 67.5%. 

18The scale of the operation was demonstrated by evidence discovered on execution of search warrants at various locations, including the Erskineville address. Two locked safes were in these premises. The applicant was later found to have the key to the smaller of the two safes. In that safe was 26.1 grams of heroin in packages. In the larger safe was 327.1 grams of heroin, in 5 bays. Other quantities of heroin were found elsewhere in the premises. Also in the room were the paraphernalia of a drug supply enterprise - foil, calculators, scales, disposable gloves, plastic bags, mobile telephones and ""paperwork"". The ""paperwork"" involved a small notebook, which recorded names and amounts of money, from 16 May 2008 to 17 April 2009. The transactions recorded in the notebook amounted to more than $3,000,000. 

19A search warrant at other premises leased in the name of Chow yielded more than $483,000 in cash (including a relatively small amount in foreign currency). This was the subject of the money-laundering offences taken into account in the sentencing of Wong and Chow. Also located in those premises was a ledger which showed receipt, during the period 12 July 2008 to 14 April 2009, of more than $3 million. It showed payments made to the three offenders. The payments made to Chow and Wong were very significantly greater than those made to the applicant, who received only $9,000. Chow and Wong each received in the vicinity of $110,000. However, the applicant had also received, and had the use of, a Honda motor vehicle. 

20The statement of facts also recorded that the applicant rented (in his name) a motor vehicle using Wong's credit card for payment. 

21The applicant was arrested on 18 April 2009 and has remained in custody since that date. 

The proceedings on sentence 

22Although the applicant entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court on 2 March 2010, sentencing proceedings in the District Court did not take place until September 2010. A joint hearing concerning the charges against each of the three co-offenders took place on that date. 

23In respect of the applicant, before the court was a Pre-Sentence Report, a psychiatric report and some medical evidence. The applicant's mother gave evidence. The applicant did not himself give evidence, but a written statement made by him was included in the materials on sentence. Similarly, neither of the co-offenders gave evidence, although, in each case, a relative did give some oral evidence. Each co-offender also provided a written statement. 

24It was from these materials that evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances emerged. 

The applicant's personal circumstances 

25In his statement the applicant expressed deep regret for his conduct, and said that he had ""a renewed insight"" into what he had done. He said that he was able to see things ""with a clear mind"", having ceased his heroin addiction. He expressed remorse. He said: 

""I was a heroin addict and took part in the criminal activities in which I was charged to finance my drug addiction. I turned to heroin use due to my decline in university studies and relationship as a way to deal with the pressures of deferring university and suppressing my emotions in a failing relationship."" 

26He said that he had been drug free since his arrest and would try his hardest to remain so in the future. He said that he had lost his career and his relationship because of his involvement in drugs and he wished to rehabilitate himself. 

27Neither the Pre-Sentence Report nor the psychiatric report reveals anything of particular note in relation to the applicant's background. The author of the Pre-Sentence Report began by observing that the majority of the information contained therein was based on information that had been provided to her by the applicant and remained largely unverified. Although she had been given contact details for family members, and had made efforts to do so, she had not been able to establish contact with family members. 

28The applicant was born in June 1979. He was almost 30 years of age at the time of offences. He was born in Australia to parents of Chinese heritage, the younger of two children. His older sister excelled in school, and qualified as an architect. His father worked as a chef, his mother as a legal secretary. 

29The applicant told the Probation and Parole officer that he began using cannabis and ecstasy at the age of 18, in a social context, approximately fortnightly or three weekly. He ceased cannabis use after about six months, but continued to use ecstasy for a period of two to three years. 

30He began using opiates in 2005 on a regular and escalating basis. In about 2007 he sought assistance through a Buprenorphine program, and remained stable on that medication for 12 months. He continued, infrequently, to use opiates and eventually did return to their use and abandoned the Buprenorphine. That the applicant had undertaken this course was confirmed by the medical evidence to which I have referred. The Probation and Parole officer said that he appeared to take responsibility for his behaviour, although she perceived ""a level of justification"" in his blaming his drug addiction for his conduct. 

31The psychiatric report was to similar effect. The psychiatrist did not offer any particular explanation by way of mitigating circumstances for the applicant's involvement in drugs. In fact, there is nothing in the evidence concerning the applicant's family history that would explain his involvement in the offence, or, indeed, in drug use. 

32The author of the Pre-Sentence Report reported positively on the applicant's progress since his arrest and incarceration. He had incurred no institutional disciplinary charges and had undertaken and completed such programmes as are available to him as an unsentenced prisoner. 

33His mother gave evidence that the applicant had done well in high school, and, although his Higher School Certificate results were not spectacular, he was admitted to an electrical engineering course at the University of Technology. However, without communicating with her, he abandoned that course at some stage. She had had some concerns that he was using drugs, although when asked he denied it. She produced a photograph, which apparently showed the applicant as being in an extremely frail, even emaciated, condition. There had been some family problems, with her mother in bad health in a nursing home, and subsequently dying. There was nothing to suggest that these circumstances had any particular impact upon the applicant. 

34He had been involved in a relationship with a woman from Malaysia, whose visa was not renewed, and who departed the country. That, perhaps, explains the reference in the applicant's statement to ""a failing relationship"" (although it does not explain why he said that his drug use was the cause of the failure). 

35It is evident that the applicant retains family support. 

The Remarks on Sentence 

36The sentencing judge recounted, in a way that has not attracted criticism, the facts of the offences, as they applied to all three offenders. In considering the objective gravity of the offences, he took a global approach. He said: 

""The Crown's submission is that this offence is above mid-range of objective seriousness because of the size of the business, the lease of premises, the hire and purchase of vehicles, the conversations and telephone calls indicating the range of customers and the capacity to supply, both claimed and demonstrated. Taking these arguments into consideration, I would find this crime as being in upper half of the mid-range of objective seriousness. This finding expressed in general terms, refers to the purely physical acts of each offender. 

... having considered the actus reus , the consequences of their conduct and the mens rea of each offender, I would classify this offence as in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. There is no basis for separating out these three offenders, although that will be necessary when considering the punishment which is appropriate to each ."" (ROS p6, italics added) 

37His Honour then made reference to the standard non-parole period, which he noted was ""prima facie"" required in the co-offenders, but not in that of the applicant. 

38In specific reference to the applicant, his Honour said: 

""[The applicant] was involved, either directly or as the driver, in five separate supplies to the police source. The items on the Form 1 to be taken into account are sufficient to make a measurable but not significant increase in the penalty which would otherwise have been applicable to his involvement because those are acts which are really comprehensible within the substance of the charge on which he is to be sentenced."" (ROS p 7) 

39Later, after referring to some of the evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances, he said: 

""[The applicant] had been involved with this distribution ring for about 12 months prior to his arrest. During this time, the Crown suggests, he was operating fully aware of his role in a well organised enterprise with access to large amounts of heroin. He was a relatively minor but important functionary, in that he usually drove the car in which the deals were conducted and from time to time actually supplied the drugs. He had access to the smaller safe which contained what might be described as immediately saleable amounts of heroin. Over the period covered by the records, he received ... less than $9,000. He did not have possession of the large sums of money under the control of Wong or Chow nor is there any evidence that he had access to the safe in which the larger quantities of heroin were stored."" (ROS p 8) 

40He noted the applicant's progress towards rehabilitation since his arrest and assessed his prospects of rehabilitation as ""good"", provided he remained abstinent from drugs. He also noted the evidence concerning the personal circumstances of the co-offenders. Wong had been sentenced, in 1998, to two terms of imprisonment to be served by periodic detention. The order that the sentences be served in that way was subsequently cancelled by the Parole Board and Wong served full time custody for a little over 2 months. He had a ""sparse"" work history. He said that he had engaged in drug supply to fund his own addiction to heroin and to make some money. He had at least twice before attempted to wean himself off heroin but had failed. 

41Chow also had a significant criminal record, commencing when he was a juvenile. In 1993 he was sentenced in respect of two counts of possession of prohibited drugs and possession of money suspected of being the proceeds of crime. In December 1993, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. The remarks on sentence do not specify the offence for which this sentence was imposed. 

42In 2006 he was again charged with possession of a prohibited drug, and given the benefit of a bond under s 9 of the Sentencing Procedure Act . His response was satisfactory and the supervision, which was a condition of the bond, was terminated after six months; the bond remained current at the time of committing the present offence. Also current was a further s 9 bond entered into in March 2009 for two charges of possession of prohibited drugs. His Honour regarded the existence of the two bonds, and the fact that Chow was subject to conditional liberty at the time of committing the present offence to be a seriously aggravating feature. 

The grounds of the application 

43Four grounds of appeal were proposed. They were pleaded as follows: 

""Ground 1: The trial judge erred in the conclusion that having regard to the objective criminality there was no basis for 'separating out these three offenders'. 

Ground 2: The trial judge erred in his approach to sentencing the applicant by adopting a two step approach where the standard non-parole period did not apply. 

Ground 3: To the extent that the proportionality principles applied his Honour failed to recognise the differences in the sentencing regimes that applied between the applicant and Wong and Chow. 

Ground 4: The sentence is manifestly excessive."" 

44On the hearing of the application, leave was granted to amend Ground 2, so that it reads: 

""The trial judge erred in his approach to sentencing the applicant by adopting the two-step approach; the mischief, identified in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357."" 

45In written submissions, counsel for the applicant argued Grounds 1 to 3 concurrently. As I understand the written submissions, it is intended to be asserted that manifest excess (the subject of Ground 4) follows from the substance of the preceding three grounds. No submission was made that, absent the considerations raised by these grounds, the sentence imposed was outside the range legitimately available in respect of the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty. 

46The application revolved around that passage in the Remarks on Sentence in which his Honour said that there was no basis for separating out the three offenders (see the sentence highlighted in the extract above at [36]). 

47This, it was contended, was an incorrect approach. There were, it was put, three bases for separating the applicant from the co-offenders. The first was his level of involvement in the enterprise; the second was his favourable personal circumstances particularly the absence of any criminal history (in contrast to both co-offenders); the third was the inapplicability of a standard non-parole period to the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty. 

48The remark concerning not separating out the three offenders calls for some analysis. It was made in the context of considering the objective gravity of the offences committed by each of the three offenders. Although his Honour immediately noted that differentiation would be required when considering punishment, it seems to me that he did not so differentiate in the assessment of the objective gravity. 

49There were, in fact, considerable distinctions to be drawn between the applicant and each of the co-offenders in that respect. Important in this consideration is the manner in which the agreed facts were framed, stating that Chow and Wong were both ""involved in all facets of the operation"" (which was shown to be of considerable magnitude) and the omission of any such assertion against the applicant the agreed facts do draw a clear distinction between the applicant and his co-offenders in respect of the extent of their involvement in the operation. The role the offender plays in a drug distribution network is of major importance in determination of sentence. Given the agreed facts, I do not think it could accurately be said that there was no basis for separating the objective gravity of his offence from the objective gravity of the other two offences. 

50Further support for that conclusion is to be found in the significant difference in the financial rewards received by the co-offenders (in excess of $100,000) compared with those received by the applicant ($9,000, together with the use of a motor vehicle). Aggravating the objective gravity of Chow's offence was the commission of the offence while on conditional liberty. Also relevant were the very serious money-laundering offences on the Form 1 in respect of both Wong and Chow, compared with the two Form 1 offences to which the applicant admitted his guilt, and which his Honour considered called for ""a measurable but not significant increase in"" penalty. Another distinction, not relevant to objective gravity, but relevant nevertheless, is the criminal histories of both Wong and Chow, compared with the absence of any such history in the applicant. 

51Although it was never expressly so stated, it seems to me that the argument advanced on behalf of the applicant depends on that part of the decision of the High Court in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 289 CLR 295 (at 301-2), which extended the ""parity principle"" ( Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606) to proportionality between sentences imposed on co-offenders whose culpability and personal circumstances are not necessarily comparable. 

52What the High Court said was: 

""Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and different degrees of criminality."" (p 302) 

53Treating the three offenders as equivalent in objective gravity led to a further matter, said to amount to error. This was this Honour took a forbidden two-step approach to sentencing.) 

54Counsel referred to authorities of this Court to the effect that, where no standard non-parole period is applicable to an offence, it is neither necessary nor desirable for a sentencing judge to make an express finding of where on a scale of objective gravity a particular offence lies. Those authorities include R v Andrew John Sivell [1009] NSWCCA 286 and Georgopolous v R [2010] NSWCCA 246. There are others to similar effect. The submissions went on: 

""30. It is apparent that his Honour commenced from the proposition that the objective criminality was comparable but there were subjective factors which warranted a distinction in penalty. Whilst the latter was no doubt correct the former has infected the sentencing exercise and the extent to which proportionality is relevant in the outcome."" 

Resolution 

55It is true, also, that the finding as to where the offence lay in the mid-range of objective seriousness appears to apply to each of the offenders. The sentences were imposed at the time when R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 was thought to state the law applicable to sentencing where a standard non-parole period has been prescribed. That is no longer the case: see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154. But, even before the decision in Muldrock , it was well recognised that to specify where an offence to which no standard non-parole period is applicable lies in a notional range of objective gravity is conducive to error: see, for example, R v Sivell ; Georgopolous v R . 

56In my opinion the error asserted cannot be substantiated. The Remarks on Sentence make it perfectly clear that his Honour was well aware that the standard non-parole period applied to the offences of which Wong and Chow admitted their guilt, and not to that charged against the applicant. There is nothing in the Remarks on Sentence that suggest that a two step approach to sentencing was taken. A finding of objective gravity is required in all cases. 

57The remaining ground, Ground 3, (which is really an aspect of Ground 1), however, cannot be so easily dismissed, particularly in respect of the sentence imposed on Chow. For convenience, I set out below a table showing the sentences: 






Applicant 

Wong 

Chow 


Total sentence 

5 years 3 months 

7 years 6 months 

6 years 


Non-parole period 

3 years 

5 years 

3 years 

58I conclude that the Wong sentence can be put to one side. The total sentence was significantly greater than that imposed on the applicant, as was the non-parole period. That sentence adequately reflects the differences between the two offenders. 

59That is not the case, however, with respect to the sentence imposed on Chow. Although Chow's involvement was greater, and his personal circumstances significantly less mitigatory than those of the applicant, his head sentence was longer than that of the applicant by only 9 months (14%) and the non-parole period identical. The difference between the two called for a greater disparity. 

60The difficulty, however, is that the offence committed by the applicant was serious and called for significant punishment. Without the ""proportionality"" issue it could not be said to be manifestly excessive. I would therefore reduce the non-parole period but only by a relatively small margin. 

61The orders I propose are: 

1. Leave to appeal granted; 

2. Appeal allowed, sentence quashed; 

3. In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years and three months, to commence on 18 April 2009 and expire on 18 July 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, expiring on 17 October 2011. 

62The applicant was eligible for consideration for release on parole from 17 October 2011.

		22 December 2011",2011-12-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708733,Alliston v R [2011] NSWCCA 281,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted of one count of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 ('the Act'). One significant matter raised in this appeal is whether the trial judge should have left to the jury the issue considered in R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292. The trial judge was asked to give the relevant direction but declined. There are further grounds of appeal concerned with the adequacy of the trial judge's summing up and the appropriateness of the appellant's sentence. The appellant also seeks leave to appeal her sentence. The trial judge imposed a sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. 

2Schedule 1 of the Act provides that a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine is 0.25kg. A large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine is 1.0 kg and above. 

3The appellant was charged with a breach of section 25(2) of the Act for supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. Section 25(2) provides that: 

""A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence."" 


4The penalties for offences involving commercial quantities are found in section 33 of the Act . The penalty for supplying a commercial quantity is a maximum of 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, or both (s 33(2)). However, where the court is satisfied that the offence involved not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug the penalty is a fine of 5,000 penalty units or imprisonment for life, or both (s 33(3)). 

5Section 3 of the Act provides an extended definition of supply. It is in the following terms: 

""Supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, suffering, permitting, or attempting any of those acts."" 

6Section 29 of the Act is an evidentiary provision which facilitates proof of the offence where a person has in their possession not less than the traffickable quantity. The traffickable quantity for methylamphetamine is 3.0 grams (schedule 1 of the Act). If the prosecution proves the relevant possession the onus shifts to the accused to prove on the balance of probabilities that the possession of the prohibited drug was for a purpose other than supply. 

Relevant Facts 

7In the present case the appellant was travelling as a passenger in a car driven by her partner Mr Schirmer. They intended to drive from Sydney to Townsville. The car was stopped by the police at Glen Innes where Mr Schirmer was given a random breath test. He returned a negative result but when questioned by the police he volunteered that he had some marijuana in the glove box of the car. 

8The police carried out a preliminary search of the car and on the floor of the front passenger seat found a purse containing two resealable bags containing pills and a paste substance, both of which contained methylamphetamine. The paste substance weighed 27.3 grams and the pills weighed 102 grams. 

9Subsequently the police completed a thorough search of the vehicle. They found secreted in the rear of the vehicle 5 heat sealed bags containing tablets with methylamphetamine. The bags weighed a total of 973.5 grams. 

10Although not relevant to the issues raised in this Court, but no doubt of significance to the jury, was evidence that relatively large sums of cash had been deposited by the appellant, at Mr Schirmer's request, into bank accounts associated with him. 

11The appellant gave evidence at her trial. With respect to the drugs in her purse she said that they were not hers but that Mr Schirmer had given them to her to carry in her purse. The following exchange occurred when she gave her evidence-in-chief at the trial: 

""Q. You're aware that the police found within the black purse a heat sealed bag containing another plastic Goliath bag with a number of pills in it, you're aware of that? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You're also aware, are you, that the police found a further amount of brown substance wrapped in a tissue? 
A. Yes. 

Q. How was that? 
A. I think it was - it might've been the first day we got to Sydney we went to Dwayne's - oh yeah, sorry, I forgot about that - we went to one of Dwayne's friends' place and picked up the drugs. 

Q. When you say the drugs, which drugs are you referring to? 
A. The ones in my handbag. 

Q. Can you describe to the jury what happened when you went out to Windsor - withdraw that. How did you get to Windsor? 
A. We drove out in the red car, I think. 

Q. Who's we? 
A. Me and Dwayne. 

Q. Was there anybody else? 
A. No. 

Q. So could you say what happened when you drove out to Windsor? 
A. Well we got there and we got in the house and we were just chatting like in the lounge for a bit and when we went to go Dwayne asked me to put the drugs into my handbag to carry to the car. 

Q. When you say he asked you to do that, did he do anything? 
A. In - what do you mean? 

Q. Who passed you the drugs to put them into your bag? 
A. Dwayne did. 

Q. He passed them to you and you put them in the bag, is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did that include the heat sealed bag with the pills inside? 
A. Yeah, all of it, whatever was in there. 

... 

Q. So on 1 October when you drove with him out to Windsor and he asked you to put a bag of tablets into your purse what did you at that time think about Mr Schirmer? 
A. Well I didn't - my first impression of him was like you know he runs his business and he was settled and all that. But when I seen that I didn't really know what I was getting into."" 

12When cross-examined the following exchange occurred: 

""Q. Tell us the details of everything you can remember about what you say you saw he gave you? 
A. Yes and he just said ""put it in your bag"" and I did. 

Q. That's all you saw when it was given to you? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You didn't look at it again until after the police retrieved it from your personal bag? 
A. Yes. 

... 

Q. Did you understand that what you say Dwayne Schirmer gave you at Windsor were drugs? 
A. I suspect it, yes. 

Q. So were you worried that the police might locate those items in your purse? 
A. No. 

Q. You weren't worried? 
A. No. 

Q. Why weren't you worried about that? 
A. Well because they weren't mine to begin with."" 

13The appellant also gave evidence in respect of the drugs secreted in plastic bags in the car. Her fingerprints were identified on the bags. The appellant said that she had no knowledge of those drugs and proffered an explanation for her fingerprints being on them. The following exchanged occurred: 

""Q. And at the time that you sent, at Mr Schirmer's request, these two outgoing text messages to Moz, were you aware at that stage of any of the drugs in the back seat of the car? 
A. No. 

Q. At that point in time what drugs did you think were actually in the car? 
A. Just what was in my little black handbag, what was in my bra. 

Q. And what was in your bra? 
A. And I think he had a bit of cannabis in his bum bag."" 

14The drugs secreted in the appellant's bra were, according to her evidence, discarded between the police search of the car and her subsequent arrest. According to the appellant a search was not done on her person, which afforded her the opportunity to discretely abandon the drugs. As such, these drugs were never listed on the indictment. The questioning continued: 

""Q. Do you know who it was who was responsible for what was in the back seat of the car? 
A. Well because Dwayne had asked me to put that stuff in my handbag in the front I just assumed that he was responsible. 

Q. Do you know who was responsible for what was in the back seat of the car? 
A. No, I don't."" 

15In the course of her evidence the appellant was referred to a letter dated 4 February 2009 which she said she had composed. She said that the contents of the letter were not true but it had been written with the objective of helping Mr Schirmer to obtain bail so that he could be with his children. The letter reads as follows: 

""To whom it may concern: 

My name is Jacinta Lee-Jeanette Alliston. 
I am currently in custody at Dillwynia Correctional Centre due to a circumstance which happened on the 3.10.08. My partner Dwyane Adrian Schirmer and I were pulled over for an (RBT) - Random Breath Test at 2am. Dwayne was driving and was breath tested at a reading below the legal limit and informed police that there was cannabis in the car when they asked of any drugs in the vehicle this lead to the car being searched and a large amount of drugs were found under the backseat and inside my handbag. Because of this my partner and I are both imprisoned awaiting court. I want to inform you Dwayne Schirmer had no knowledge of the drugs or the drugs being there. He had no involvement whatsoever. I hereby am admitting to having sole responsibility for the charges laid. Due to my irresponsible actions of this criminal offence Dwayne had property seized as stolen goods and cash seized as suspected unlawfully obtained which had no part in the crime. Also three young children of his are being deprived of his nurture and care and a carpentary business he cannot fulfill his duties of running as a victim of my crime. Don't let this man suffer the consequences I should be punished for. 

Kind regards, 

Jacinta Alliston"" (sic) 

16The creation of the letter and the appellant's acknowledgement that it was not true was particularly damaging to her credit. 

17Four grounds of appeal were pleaded. The first three related to the conviction, the fourth was concerned with the sentence. 

Ground 1: Her Honour erred by not directing the jury that the possession of the appellant must consider whether the possession was for other than supply. 

Ground 2: Her Honour failed to sum up the case for the appellant. 

Ground 3: Her Honour erred in not sufficiently identifying as a possible verdict that the accused was not guilty of all charges; the primary charge, the first alternative, and the second alternative 

18It is convenient to consider the grounds together. 

19The decision of this Court in Carey concerned the circumstance where a person has drugs under their physical control but always intends to return them to the owner or the person reasonably believed to be the owner. If the accused establishes the necessary intention an offence contrary to s 25 cannot be established. In these circumstances the accused will not have the relevant drug(s) in ""his or her possession for supply"". Supply as defined in s 29 of the Act does not ""include the mere return of the drugs to their owner or to the person reasonably believed to be the owner"" (Hunt J at p 294). 

20Hunt J emphasised that the words ""sending, forwarding, delivering"" are all qualified by the words ""for supply."" His Honour said at p 297: 

""The word 'supply' where secondly appearing in s 29 of the Act therefore does not include the mere transfer of physical control of the drugs from a person who has had the drugs deposited with him to their owner or to the person reasonably believed to be such."" 

21However his Honour acknowledged that in many, if not in most cases, the circumstances of the delivery would have the consequence that the accused was an accessory of the person by whom the delivery was affected. 

22In Carey the drugs were found in the appellant's bedside table. The appellant said that her sister had asked her to mind them overnight and that the sister intended to collect the drugs the next day. The appellant said that she did not herself use drugs and she intended to flush the drugs down the toilet if they were not collected by her sister. 

23A "" Carey defence"" has been held to be available in a number of other cases. 

24In R v EAS (unreported NSWCCA 26 July 1990) the evidence was that cocaine had been left with the appellant by his brother for ""safe keeping"" while the brother was interstate. A "" Carey defence"" was held to be available. 

25In R v Tuckey (1991) 57 A Crim R 468 the appellant was found in possession of 13.4 grams of cocaine. He gave evidence that he had agreed to sell some clothes to a man named Nigel, who did not immediately have the money available to pay for them but wanted to take them with him. Nigel offered to leave some cocaine as security. When arrested the appellant had been in possession of the drugs for a week and said that he intended to return them to Nigel. The court held that a "" Carey defence"" should have been left to the jury. 

26In R v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 the accused gave evidence that he was holding the drugs for his friend until his friend asked for the drugs to be returned. The drugs were held by the accused for close to 32 months. The Court ordered a retrial on the basis that the "" Carey defence"" should have been left to the jury. 

27In R v Fong (unreported NSWCCA 29 November 1996) there was evidence that the appellant had been asked to look after the drugs. This Court said that there was a ""real question whether his possession was for the purpose of supply or temporary custody and return to the owner"" and that the issue should have been left to the jury. 

28Before a "" Carey defence"" can be sustained, it is necessary for the party raising it to demonstrate that the evidence is capable of proving that the accused's possession of the drugs was merely momentary or transient and that the accused intended to return the drugs to their owner ( R v EAS (unreported NSWCCA 26 July 1990; R v Tuckey (1991) 57 A Crim R 468; R v Frazer [2002] NSWCCA 59). Analogies have in the past been drawn to the concept of bailment ( R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78). 

29In the present case the possibility of a "" Carey defence"" was raised by defence counsel with the trial judge before the summing up. Her Honour questioned whether the defence was available in the absence of evidence from the appellant in which she said she intended to return the drugs to Mr Schirmer. 

30Counsel accepted that there was no evidence of the appellant actually stating or indicating that she intended to return the drugs. However, counsel stressed to her Honour that the relevant inference was available. Counsel emphasised the following exchange in the evidence of the appellant: 

""Q. You knew you were going to be stopped at Glen Innes? 

A. Well, I didn't know. I didn't know what he was doing with them. I didn't know if he was taking them back to Peter or who, where."" 

31It was submitted that it is implicit in this answer that the drugs were Mr Schirmer's and that, insofar as some drugs were found in the appellant's purse, they remained in control of Mr Schirmer who would determine what would happen to them. Although the appellant did not expressly indicate that she proposed to return the drugs to Mr Schirmer, it was submitted that this inference was available from her evidence. 

32Having rejected the possibility of a "" Carey defence"" her Honour gave the jury the following directions. Her Honour said: 

"" ... you are aware that Ms Alliston in her evidence admitted that the accused Mr Shirmer gave her those bags, that is, the paste and the tablets, found in the black purse which I think is exhibit E. She says she had them effectively in her custody and control and said she effectively that she was keeping them for him. Effectively that they had joint possession of them. You have to decide whether you accept her evidence of that on that point. She specifically said in evidence that she knew that they were prohibited drugs. And as I have said before you are aware that the weight of those prohibited drugs was in excess of three grams."" 

33To my mind it is clear, as her Honour acknowledged, that the appellant was in possession, at least, of the drugs found in her purse. The jury must also have found that she was in possession of the drugs secreted elsewhere in the car. However, the fact that she was in possession of the drugs does not mean that she was guilty of the offence of supply. In accordance with the decision in Carey before she could be guilty of supply the jury would have to be satisfied that she was both in possession of the drugs and was holding them for the purpose of supply rather than returning them to Mr Schirmer who had continuing control over them. 

34Although the appellant did not actually say in her evidence that her intention was to hold the drugs and later return them to her partner, in my opinion it was it was open to the jury to conclude, from her responses to the questions which she was asked as to how she came into possession at least of the drugs in her purse, that this was in fact the case. In relation to those drugs the "" Carey defence"" should be have been left to the jury and accordingly ground 1 of the appeal should be accepted. To that extent the trial judge's summary of the defence case was also inadequate. However, lest there be a misunderstanding, I express no view about the manner in which a jury might have resolved this issue. 

35This conclusion is not the end of the matter. Although I am satisfied that the "" Carey defence"" should have been left in relation to the drugs in the purse I can see no basis for it to have been left in respect of the drugs in the plastic bags in the car. The appellant denied all knowledge of those drugs but her evidence must have been rejected by the jury. The jury must have found that the appellant was together with Mr Schirmer in possession of those drugs. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that her possession of them was transitory or that she intended to ""return"" them to another person. 

36The charge as framed included both the drugs in the purse and the drugs in the car which together weighed a total of 1,102.8 grams, placing the offence as charged into the category of a large commercial quantity. The jury did not find that offence proved, its verdict being confined to a commercial quantity of the drug. When sentencing the appellant the trial judge, as her Honour was required to do, made factual findings consistent with the jury's verdict and said: 

""In Ms Alliston's case there are two bases on which the jury could have reached its verdict, the first is that she was not in possession of the drugs in the handbag. However, in the light of the jury's note, MFI 39, in my view it is more probable that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she knew, or was aware, that there was a significant or real chance that the amount was more than the large commercial quantity. I propose to sentence her on that basis."" 

37It may be that her Honour's conclusion is correct. The jury note, to which her Honour referred, asked whether the accused needed to understand the meaning of a large commercial quantity before she could be convicted. However, I do not believe that this is now of any significance. 

38In the result, in my opinion, although the "" Carey issue"" should have been left with the jury in respect of the drugs in the appellant's purse, the fact that it was not has had no adverse consequence for the appellant. She was convicted of the offence appropriate to the quantity of drugs in respect of which a "" Carey defence"" was not available. Although the trial judge did not leave the "" Carey defence"" and accordingly did not adequately put the appellant's case to the jury I am not persuaded that for that reason there has been a miscarriage of justice. 

39With respect to ground 3 of the appeal the trial judge directed the jury as to their possible verdicts in relation to both the appellant and Mr Schirmer. In the course of her Honour's summing up she provided the jury in writing with the alternative verdicts which were open to the jury. The document included the following: 

""1. The accused is Guilty or Not Guilty of the charge on the indictment 

2. The accused is Not Guilty of the charge on the indictment but is Guilty of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (weight 250g) 

3. The accused is Not Guilty of the charge on the indictment but Guilty of supplying a prohibited drug."" 

40The appellant submitted that her Honour's directions, and in particular the written directions, pointed to only three available verdicts and did not include the possibility that the appellant might be not guilty of the principle charge and both the statutory alternatives. This issue was not raised at the trial and rule 4 applies. 

41A reading of the summing up confirms that the trial judge directed the jury as to the onus and standard of proof. Her Honour described the elements of the offence which the Crown must prove including the ""fourth element"" being ""possession"" of the drugs. When speaking to the written directions her Honour said: 

""To find the accused not guilty of the charge on the indictment effectively means that you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he or she had possession of any of the drugs in the car. In other words the Crown would fail at that very fourth element. Then if the Crown fails on the fourth element that is the end of your deliberations in respect of that accused."" 

42I have no doubt that the jury were aware that they could return a verdict of acquittal. In any event the verdict which the jury returned confirms that they were satisfied to the required standard that the appellant had in her possession a commercial quantity of the drug. The verdict makes plain that the jury were satisfied of all of the elements of the offence necessary for a conviction. 

43Defence counsel raised no issue with her Honour's direction and I am not persuaded that any further direction was required. 

44I would refuse leave to raise ground 3. 

45It follows in relation to the appeal against conviction that although ground 1 and 2 are made out the problem with the directions is confined to the drugs in the appellant's purse. However, having regard to the jury's verdict there has been no miscarriage of justice and I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 

Ground 4: The sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances and another sentence is warranted at law. 

46The appellant was sentenced for the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years and there is a standard non-parole period of 10 years ( Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 54A and item 18 in the Table to Division 1A of Part 4). Her Honour was of course sentencing before the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 and followed the approach to sentencing required by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. 

47Her Honour regarded the appellant's involvement in the offence as ""falling significantly below the mid range of objective gravity"" and in part for that reason her Honour did not believe that it was appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period. Although her Honour found that the appellant did not participate in the planning of the offence she nevertheless sentenced her on the basis that she played an active part in the packaging of the drugs located in the back of the car. 

48Her Honour said: 

""The quantity of the drug, 953.5 grams, is towards the top of the range for a commercial quantity. However Ms Alliston's involvement in this offence was at a low level. It essentially came about because she had the misfortune to become emotionally attached to Mr Schirmer. Nevertheless, based on the fingerprint evidence, she assisted in the packaging of the drugs in the five heat sealed bags, and of course she was prepared to accompany him on the trip back to Townsville knowing that the car contained a large quantity of illegal drugs. 

In her case no aggravating factors have been taken into account given her limited role. She was not part of any planning involved in the offence and any financial gain she made would be dependent on Mr Schirmer's goodwill. 

I find that her offence falls significantly below the mid range of objective gravity, therefore again in her case it is not appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period. There are additional reasons for not doing so. They are: 

- her youth and the fact that this is her first custodial sentence, 
- that she has no prior convictions, 
- her mental health issues and isolation in custody, which will make her term of imprisonment more onerous, and 
- my finding that she has good prospect for rehabilitation. 

In her case I do find special circumstances as in my view it is essential that she have a longer period of supervision on parole than that provided by the usual ratio for the reasons that I have outlined in this judgment."" 

49With respect to subjective matters her Honour said: 

""Turning now to consider matters personal to Ms Alliston, she is now 20 years of age. At the time of the offence she was only 18. She has no prior convictions in New South Wales. She and her twin sister are the youngest in the family of five girls. They were raised by their mother in Queensland. However, because her mother was battling mental health issues the offender spent periods of time in foster care. She has essentially no relationship with her father, who I gather was not part of the family from when the offender was very young. She has in effect been on her own, and without stable accommodation, since she was 15. In addition she has been physically and sexually abused. In summary, she has had an extremely difficult and to quote from the psychiatric report ""chaotic childhood and adolescence"". It is not necessary to relate further details in this judgment, but sadly she has not had the benefit of a stable early life. She was educated to year nine level and then engaged in a period of home schooling for a period of a few months. Her employment history is limited to a few brief casual positions. To the psychologist, Ms White, she expressed an interest in completing year 11 and 12 studies while in custody. 

She would clearly benefit from undertaking as many educational and vocational courses as she can during the period she is in prison. I note that to date she has only been able to complete a drawing course, that may be because she has been on remand. 

Since being arrested she has experienced anxiety and depressive symptoms, which is not surprising given her young age. In the psychiatrist's opinion: 

'it is likely these in part relate to her experience of being in custody and I would consider that the onset of these symptoms in prison relate in part to the stress of isolation and incarceration.' 

Of even greater concern is the evidence that there have been two episodes of self harm, and that the offender displays a number of symptoms of psychosis. 

Dr Clark, who prepared the psychiatric report in July this year noted that: 

'Ms Alliston will thus require close mental health monitoring, including periodic psychiatric review to monitor her mental state and response to medications.' 

He went onto say: 

'In addition to an antidepressant, which can assist in treating her depressive and anxiety symptoms, she may require treatment with anti-psychotic medications as well. I believe that a further trial of low dose anti-psychotic medication may be warranted.' 

Dr Clark recommended that Ms Alliston receive cognitive therapy, which she is apparently now receiving. He also noted: 

'Given her chaotic adolescence she will require counselling to assist her in developing appropriate coping strategies, and to interact in social relationships in ways which are less deleterious to her ongoing mental health, and will assist in her further development interpersonally, socially and vocationally.' 

It is hoped that these recommendations will be acted on while Ms Alliston is in custody. 

She too has a history of drug and alcohol abuse, and Dr Clark suggested that she refrain from use of both as it was likely such substances would impact negatively on her mental state. It is clear that she will need ongoing support when she is released, especially as she has few positive role models among her family members, and little, if any, support in the community. If she takes advantage of the vocational and health facilities available in custody in my view she has good prospects for rehabilitation."" 

50The appellant submitted that her Honour's finding of special circumstances was appropriate but that in the circumstances the sentence imposed was erroneously excessive, in particular bearing in mind the low level of the appellant's criminality. It was submitted that the appellant was a vulnerable dupe and was in reality ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"". 

51There being no particular error identified by the appellant before she could succeed on this ground she must demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" conscious of the fact that there is no single correct sentence. This Court cannot substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that judge: Dinsdale v R (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [57]; Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [26] - [28]. 

52Although the sentencing judge found that the appellant was less culpable than her co-offender, she nonetheless was knowingly involved in the supply of the drugs and had played an active role in the packing of the drugs. It may be as the Crown submitted that her Honour's finding that the appellant was not part of any planning of the offence was lenient in light of the finding the she was involved in packing the drugs. Although I have not overlooked the appellant's subjective case, of which her Honour was clearly conscious and was reflected in the non-parole period having regard to the large quantity of drugs, and the appellant's knowing involvement in the preparation of the drugs for supply, I am not persuaded that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust. 

53Although I would grant leave to appeal, the appeal against sentence should be dismissed. 

Orders 

1. Leave to appeal is granted. 
2. The appeal is dismissed. 

54SIMPSON J: On 7 December 2009 the appellant and Dwayne Adrian Schirmer were arraigned in the District Court on an indictment that charged them jointly with supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine). Each entered a plea of not guilty to the charge, and a trial before a jury proceeded. On 23 December 2009, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of the charge on the indictment against Schirmer; it found the appellant not guilty of that charge, but guilty of an alternative charge of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of the drug. 

55On 30 July 2010, Hock DCJ sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 7 years, commencing on 3 October 2008, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, expiring on 2 April 2012. 

56The appellant appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed. Schirmer has abandoned an appeal that he earlier filed. 

Relevant legislation 

57It is convenient here to set out the relevant legislative provisions. All are contained in Part 2, Division 2 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (""the DMT Act ""). The relevant provisions are: 

""25(1) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence. 

... 

(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence. 

... 

(3) Where, on the trial of a person for an offence under subs (2) [that is, supply of a commercial quantity] ... the jury are not satisfied that the amount of prohibited drug involved is equal to or more than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug, they may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of an offence under subs (1) [supply of prohibited drug] ... and the person shall be liable to punishment accordingly."" 

""29 A person who has in his or her possession an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug shall, for the purposes of this Division, be deemed to have the prohibited drug in his or her possession for supply, unless 

(a) the person proves that he or she had the prohibited drug in his or her possession otherwise than for supply; or 

(b) ..."" 

58""Supply"" is given an extended definition. By s 3, it includes: 

""keeping or having in possession for supply""; 
""sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply""' ""authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things."" 

59By s 3 and Sch 1 methylamphetamine is a prohibited drug. The traffickable quantity is 3 grams; the indictable quantity is 5 grams; the commercial quantity is 250 grams; the large commercial quantity is 1 kilogram. 

60Sections 32 and 33 provide for penalties on conviction for drug offences. Relevantly, pursuant to s 32(1)(c), the penalty for an offence under s 25(1) (supply) is imprisonment for 15 years. Pursuant to s 33(1)(a) and (2) the penalty for an offence under s 25(2) (supply of not less than the commercial quantity) is imprisonment for 20 years. Pursuant to s 33(3), where the offence involves not less than the large commercial quantity, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life. 

The Crown case 

61The Crown did not seek to prove any actual physical supply of the drug by either accused. Rather, it relied upon the deeming provision, s 29 of the DMT Act (above). 

62The Crown case was as follows. In the early hours of 3 October 2008, the appellant was a passenger in a red Nissan Exa motor vehicle, then being driven by Schirmer on the Midlands Highway near Glen Innes. At 2.30 am police signalled Schirmer to pull over for what was said to be random breath test. Schirmer pulled over and alighted from the vehicle. The appellant remained in the vehicle. A breath test was administered to Schirmer and proved negative. After a brief conversation with Schirmer, police decided to conduct a search of the vehicle. During this conversation, Schirmer told police that he had in the vehicle a quantity of cannabis. 

63At the request of police, the appellant alighted from the vehicle while they conducted a search. On the floor of the passenger side of the vehicle they located a black purse, which was found to contain a brown paste substance (later weighed at 27.3 grams) and some tablets (later weighed at 102 grams) in separate resealable plastic bags. The appellant acknowledged that the purse was hers. Later analysis revealed that both the brown substance and the tablets contained methylamphetamine. 

64The appellant and Schirmer were cautioned, arrested, and taken in a police vehicle to the Glen Innes police station. One of the police officers drove the Nissan to the police station, where it was secured in a police garage. A bum bag was found on the side of the driver's seat. When it was opened, it was found to contain more than $1,500 in cash, predominantly in $100 and $50 notes. 

65At the police garage a further search of the vehicle was conducted, in the presence of the appellant (but not Schirmer). This search revealed, under the back seat, a plastic bag. Inside the bag were a number of heat-sealed plastic bags, five in all. In turn, these bags contained another 21 bags, all containing variously coloured tablets. These weighed 973.5 grams. They were later analysed and shown to contain methylamphetamine. The appellant's fingerprints were found on three of the bags. 

66Also found in the appellant's purse were documents that included bank deposit slips for amounts of $9,500, $7,000 and $8,000. Although this was a significant piece of evidence, it appears to have little, if any, relevance to the grounds raised in the appeal, and can be passed over without further mention. 

67At 6.55 am on 3 October, following her arrest, the appellant was interviewed by police. The interview was electronically recorded. The appellant answered a number of questions, in the course of which she admitted to having used narcotic drugs in the past. When asked about the relationship between herself and Schirmer, she said it was: 

""Excellent. Like I feel bad like 'cause, you know, I'm a bit of a bad girl. I'm being good but."" 

68When asked to explain that, she said: 

""Like, you know, I've tried drugs before. And he's told me about his life. He's living a pretty good life, you know. He's a good boy. He's got kids, he does well for 'em and, yeah."" 

69She said that police searching the car had found a ""billy"" which she said was a ""bong"" or a device used for smoking cannabis. It was put to her that police had found cannabis in the glove box of the car. She said she agreed with that. When asked who the owner of the cannabis was, she said: 

""I'm not putting a name to it."" 

70She said that she did ""not really"" know that the cannabis was there. 

71The appellant confirmed that the black purse was her property and said that the bum bag belonged to Schirmer. 

72She was then asked about the money in the bum bag. At that point she declined to answer any further questions. 

73The appellant was not granted bail. She remained in custody from her arrest on 3 October 2008. 

74She remained in contact, by letter, with Schirmer, who was also, at that stage, in custody. 

75On 4 February 2009, the appellant wrote a letter (Exhibit R in the trial), addressed to ""To Whom it May Concern"". The letter read: 

""My name is Jacinta Lee-Jeanette Alliston. 

I am currently in custody at Dillwynia Correctional Centre due to a circumstance which happened on the 3.10.08. My partner, Dwayne Adrian Schirmer and I were pulled over for an (RBT) - Random Breath Test at 2 am. Dwayne was driving and was breath tested at a reading below the legal limit and informed police there was cannabus [sic] in the car when they asked of any drugs in the vehicle. This lead [sic] to the car being searched and a large amount of drugs were found under the backseat and inside my handbag. Because of this my partner and I are both imprisoned awaiting court. I want to inform you Dwayne Schirmer had no knowledge of the drugs or the drugs being there. He had no involvement whatsoever. I hereby am admitting to having sole responsibility for the charges laid. Due to my irresponsible actions of this criminal offence Dwayne had property seized as stolen goods and cash seized as suspected unlawfully obtained which had not part in the crime. Also three young children of his are being deprived of his nurture and care and a carpentary [sic] business he cannot fulfill [sic] his duties of running as a victim of my crime. Don't let this man suffer the consequences I should be punished for. 

Kind regards 

Jacinta Alliston"" 

76The letter appears to have been written at the request (direct or indirect) of Schirmer, in order to facilitate an application made by him for bail. 

The trial 

77Evidence in the Crown case was given in accordance with the above outline. The appellant gave evidence. She said that in 2008 she was living in Townsville, where she met Schirmer in July of that year, and that after about a month a relationship developed between them. She understood that he had a carpentry business, that he had recently broken up with his partner, and that he had three children. [From evidence given by Schirmer, it appears that he was, at the time, living in Sydney, but was holidaying in Townsville, and that after meeting the appellant, he made regular trips to Townsville, either by car or by air. There was documentary evidence recording a number of occasions on which Schirmer, and the appellant, had travelled by air between Sydney and Townsville.] 

78The appellant said that at the time she met Schirmer she was using ""ecstasy and speed and ice"", the last on a daily basis. With his help she ceased using drugs (or reduced her use). 

79She said that on three or four occasions she and Schirmer travelled to Sydney, where his children lived. 

80She said that at Schirmer's request she had on occasions deposited money in bank accounts in the names of other people. She believed that the source of the money was his carpentry business. She did not think that he was involved in illegal activity. 

81She said that, about two days before their arrest, Schirmer had asked her to fly to Sydney with him. She was reluctant to do so because she had other plans, but agreed because he wanted to see his children, and also because they intended to pick up a new car which they had purchased for her. They did in fact travel to Sydney, and pick up a new (second-hand) car, (the red Nissan) and were returning to Townsville when arrested. 

82She again identified the black purse as her property. She was asked about the drugs in the purse, and if she knew how they had got there. She said that she did know. It is necessary to extract, in some detail, some of her evidence in chief. The following is drawn from the transcript: 

""Q Do you know who [sic] those items got into your black purse? 

A Yes. 

Q How was that? 

A I think it was - it might have been the first day we got to Sydney we went to Dwayne's - oh yeah, sorry, forgot about that - we went to one of Dwayne's friend's place and picked up the drugs. 

Q When you say the drugs which drugs are you referring to? 

A The ones in my handbag. 

Q Do you know what suburb you went to, or where you sent? 

A I think it was out near Windsor. 

... 

Q How did you get out to Windsor? 

A We drove out in the red car, I think. 

Q Who's we? 

A Me and Dwayne. 

Q Was there anybody else? 

A No. 

Q So could you say what happened when you drove out to Windsor? 

A Well we got there and we got in the house and we were just chatting like in the lounge for a bit and when we went to go Dwayne asked me to put the drugs in my handbag to carry to the car . 

Q When you say he asked you to do that, did he do anything? 

A In - what do you mean? 

Q Who passed you the drugs to put them in your bag? 

A Dwayne did. 

Q He passed them to you and you put them in the bag, is that right? 

A Yes. 

Q Does that include the heat sealed bag with the pills inside? 

A Yeah, all of it, whatever was in there. 

Q What the about the amount of drugs that were wrapped in the white tissue? 

A Yes, that was there. 

... 

Q So you put those drugs into your black purse? 

A Yes. 

Q Then what did you do? 

A We left and went into the car and drove back to Pete's I think. 

..."" (AB2 362 - 383, T 335 -356, italics added) 

The appellant also said that Schirmer had given her a small bag of ecstasy tablets which she concealed in her bra, after she and Schirmer had consumed one each. She said that these were still in her bra at the time police stopped the car, but that she disposed of them while police were attending to the arrest of Schirmer. 

She said that during the course of the journey she thought that the drugs in the car were (only) those in her black bag, and in her bra, together with a small amount of cannabis in Schirmer's bum bag. She said she was unaware of the drugs under the back seat. 

83The appellant gave some evidence (relevant to the grounds of appeal) under cross-examination by counsel for Schirmer, as follows: 

""Q You knew he wouldn't approve you having anything to do with these drugs? 

A They weren't my drugs. 

Q You did it behind his back didn't you? 

A No. 

Q At the time you were writing these letters you felt terrible about what you had done to Dwayne Schirmer, didn't you? 

A No, at the time I wrote the letters I was showing him how much I was thankful. When you are born into a family of drug addicts, paedophiles and prostitutes and then you try your whole life to get away and escape from that and then you finally get someone you think God has sent me an angel to take me away from all of that, I was doing everything fucking could from the first minute to get him out of this."" (AB 446, T419) 

... 

""Q Did you understand that what you say Dwayne Schirmer gave you at Windsor were drugs? 

A I suspected it, yes. 

Q So weren't you worried that the police might locate those items in your purse? 

A No. 

Q You weren't worried? 

A No. 

Q Why weren't you worried about that? 

A Well because they weren't mine to begin with."" (AB 447, T420) 

... 

""Q We will do it one at a time, Ms Alliston. Dealing with the methylamphetamine tablets in [sic - and] the paste which was located by police in your purse I am putting to you that Mr Schirmer had nothing at all to do with that? 

A He did. 

Q He didn't give it to you? 

A Yes, he did."" (AB 529 - 530, T502 - 503) 

84In the transcript of the cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown Prosecutor the following passages appear: 

""Q What did you think was going to be happening to the drugs, that's the tablets and the paste in your purse that would otherwise have gone to Queensland but for being stopped at Glen Innes? 

A I don't know, I just - Dwayne and his mates were doing their thing. I don't know what was going on until I saw that. 

Q Well they weren't going to be used I suggest for either your or your and Dwayne's personal use, correct? 

A Yes 

... 

Q What you took from Dwayne at Windsor and put in your purse and kept with you on the road north up the New England Highway were drugs that were more than for personal use I suggest? 

A Not for me, no. 

Q No. They were for supply in Queensland? 

A I don't know what he wanted to do with them. 

... 

Q Well going back to my second suggestion to you was that as part of the storing and transporting of those drugs in the purse earlier at Windsor was that you knew that they were being - ultimately to be used for sale later in Queensland? 

A I didn't know that. I didn't know what his deal was with his mates."" (AB2 539-540) 

... 

Q Did you examine what you received from Dwayne Schirmer at all? 

A No, it was just sitting on the table, on the end of the coffee table, I was on a chair here, Dwayne was there, and the other dude was here and it was sitting there and all I could see was the tissue bit wrapped on top of the plastic and he just said, 'Can you put this in your bag?', and I just grabbed it and put it in my bag and put it in the car. 

... 

""Q So is it the case that you received one bundle, as it were, or one item from Mr Schirmer? 

A Yeah. 

Q You knew they were drugs though, didn't you? 

A Yeah, I figured they were. 

Q They were, weren't they? 

A Yes. 

Q You took them from the house at Windsor knowing they were drugs? 

A Yes. 

Q It was more than suspicion, wasn't it, it was belief? 

A Yes. 

Q You were doing the person you loved a favour at the time? 

A Yeah. 

Q You didn't take them for your own use? 

A For my own use? 

Q Yes? 

A No, I didn't know if - like we were going to be having them, or what. 

Q You knew they were heading off to Queensland but for being stopped at Glen Innes? 

A Well I didn't know. I didn't know what he was doing with them. I didn't know if he was taking them to Peter or who, where. 

Q But you had them with you when you left Sydney? 

A Yeah. I totally forgot they were on the floor in my handbag because when I put them in the car like that's where they remained until the cops had found them. 

... 

A Yeah, I just totally forgot that they were in the car. I didn't know - because I was drinking and stuff and I wasn't focussing on what he was doing. 

Q You're not suggesting to the jury that you had forgotten that they were drugs, just that you'd forgotten that they were there? 

A Oh no I knew - yeah, I just forgot they were there. I know [sic] they were drugs."" (AB2 587 - 588) 

85The appellant explained how the letter (Exhibit R) came to be written. She said that she had received from Schirmer a letter (Exhibit 6) dated 9 December 2008 (his birthday), among many other letters. In that letter, he wrote ( inter alia ): 

""So pray for me babe, but I need you to do a couple of things for me. When you speak to jason next he will let you know what I need you to do. So thank you for being by my side and being there for me! Without you I would be lost and lonely ..."" 

86She said that she understood what he required her to do was to write a letter saying that he had nothing to do with the drugs. [""Jason"" was Jason Pardey, Schirmer's brother-in-law.] Mr Pardey did visit the appellant in prison where they spoke about the letter. She said: 

""Well it's to do with when I was in the back of the police car and I said 'I will do whatever I can, I'll try to get us out of this', and they'd asked me to write the letter and I knew he needed to get out and see his kids and that and sort stuff out so I helped him by writing the letter."" (AB2 388 - 389, T361 - 362) 

87In that context, she gave the following evidence (in chief): 

""Q Did you write that letter because you knew at the time when police arrested you that there were drugs in the back seat of the car? 

A No. 

Q When you wrote that letter what were your feelings towards Mr Schirmer? 

A Like I said before, I would have done anything for him. 

Q Is that what you did in writing the letter? 

A Yes. 

Q When the police pulled over the car for the random breath test did you have any idea what was in the back seat of the car? 

A No. 

Q Do you know who it was who was responsible for what was in the back seat of the car? 

A Well because Dwayne asked me to put that stuff in my handbag in the front I just assumed that he was responsible. 

Q Do you know who was responsible for what was in the backseat of the car? 

A No, I don't."" (AB 388 - 389, T 361 -362) 

88Schirmer also gave evidence, at some length. He denied his guilt of the offence and gave an account, in considerable detail, of his movements shortly before and up to the time the two were arrested. The import of his evidence was that he knew nothing of the drugs, either those in the appellant's purse, or those in the back of the car. 

89Put simply, each accused denied knowledge of the drugs under the back seat of the car, and blamed the other for their presence. The appellant acknowledged possession of the drugs in the purse, but said that she held them at Schirmer's request; Schirmer denied knowledge of those drugs also. 

90At the conclusion of the final addresses by the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for Schirmer, counsel who appeared for the appellant sought to confirm that the alternative verdicts that would be left to the jury were: 


supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine; 
the statutory alternative of supplying the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and a third alternative of supplying a traffickable quantity of methylamphetamine. 

91She agreed with her Honour that supply of a traffickable quantity would amount to ""supply simpliciter "". She then sought a direction ""in terms of Carey and Liberti "" but expressly limited the application for such a direction to the third alternative of supplying a traffickable quantity of the drug. The reason for that will become apparent. I will explain below the nature of the direction counsel sought. 

92After discussion, her Honour declined to give such a direction. She did so because she considered that there was no evidentiary basis to support it. That ruling is the foundation for grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal. 

93Counsel for the appellant then addressed, and her Honour summed up. She gave the jury three documents. The first (MFI 37) set out written directions. (MFI 37, in fact, consisted of two separate documents, identical, one each in relation to the accused.) The written directions were expressly stated ""to be read in conjunction with the oral directions given"". That in relation to the appellant was in the following terms: 

""The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that on 3 October 2008 at Glen Innes: 

1. the tablets and substance contained methylamphetamine; and 

2. methylamphetamine is a prohibited drug; and 

3. the amount of the drug was more than the traffickable quantity (which is 3 g); and 

4. the accused had more than the traffickable quantity of methylamphetamine in her possession ; and 

5. the total amount of the prohibited drug was more than the large commercial quantity applicable to methylamphetamine (which is 1000 g); and 

6. the accused had more than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine in her possession; and 

7. the accused knew the amount of the prohibited drug was more than the large commercial quantity applicable to methylamphetamine. 

Possession means: 

a. the accused intentionally had the substance in her physical custody or control to the exclusion of others, except anyone who was acting jointly with her in committing this alleged offence; and 

b. the accused knew or believed at the time that it was a prohibited drug. The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew or believed that what she had custody or control of was a prohibited drug, or was aware there was a significant or real chance that it was."" 

The second document (MFI 38), that related to both accused, was entitled ""Possible Verdicts"" and was as follows: 

""1. The accused is Guilty or Not Guilty of the charge on the indictment. 

2. The accused is Not Guilty of the charge on the indictment but is Guilty of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (weight 2.50g). 

3. The accused is Not Guilty of the charge on the indictment but Guilty of supplying a prohibited drug."" 

94This document, to which no objection was taken at trial, is the foundation for ground 3 of the appeal. 

95During the course of the oral directions, the trial judge asked the jury to amend their copies of the written directions by inserting, in directions 6 and 7, brackets around the words ""large"". She did this in order to draw to the jury's attention the possibility of what was said to be the statutory alternative to the charge on the indictment, a verdict of guilty of supply of a commercial quantity, as distinct from a large commercial quantity. In relation to the ""Alternative Verdicts"" written direction she elaborated by saying: 

""Firstly, the accused is guilty or not guilty of the charge on the indictment, as I have just said. For the accused to be guilty of the charge on the indictment the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt of all seven elements, including large commercial quantity, element 6 and large commercial quantity, element 7. 

To find the accused not guilty of the charge on the indictment effectively means that you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he or she had possession of any of the drugs in the car. In other words the Crown would fail at that very fourth element. Then if the Crown fails on the fourth element that is the end of your deliberations in respect of that accused. ..."" 

She went on to deal with the second and third alternatives on the document. 

96The jury retired to consider its verdict at 2.22 pm on 22 December 2009. At 3.11 pm they sent the trial judge a note (MFI 39) in the following terms: 

""The jury needs clarification on point 7 again. Does the accused need to understand what large commercial quantity means?"" 

97Her Honour directed the jury that they did not have to be satisfied that the accused knew the precise amount of the drug, but that the Crown did have to prove that the accused ""actually knew, or believed"" that the quantity he or she had in possession was not less than the relevant quantity - that is the commercial quantity, or the large commercial quantity. 

The grounds of appeal 

98The grounds of appeal are pleaded as follows: 

""1. Her Honour erred by not directing the jury that the possession of the appellant must consider whether the possession was for other than supply [sic]. 

2. Her Honour failed to sum up the case for the appellant. 

3. Her Honour erred in not sufficiently identifying as a possible verdict the accused was not guilty of all charges; the primary charge, the first alternative, and the second alternative. 

4. The sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances, and another sentence is warranted at law."" 

Grounds 1 and 2 

99The foundation for these grounds is the refusal of the trial judge to direct the jury in accordance with the express request may by counsel for the appellant . 

100The application was based upon the decision of this Court in R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292, followed in R v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120. It is convenient here to extract the principle stated in those decisions. In Carey Hunt J (as he then was), with whom Wood and Finlay JJ agreed, said: 

""The word 'supply' where secondly appearing in s 29 of the Act [ie in sub-para (a)] therefore does not include the transfer of physical control of the drugs from a person who had the drugs deposited with him to their owner or to the person reasonably believed to be such. Although the issue does not directly arise in this appeal it is clear ... that the same construction must also be applied to the word 'supply' in the phrase 'having in possession for supply' in the definition of 'supply' in s 3."" 

101The facts in Carey were simple. The appellant had, in a bedside table, traffickable quantities of two different drugs. She did not dispute the possession. She told police that the drugs had been left with her by her sister, to mind overnight, and that her sister was to collect them the following day. If her sister did not do so, it was the appellant's intention to flush them down the toilet. 

102The Court held that it ought to have been (but was not) left to the jury to determine whether the appellant had proved (within s 29(a)) that she had the drugs in her possession ""otherwise than for supply"". The decision turned on the meaning of ""supply"" in that context. 

103In O'Brien v Smith (unreported, NSWSC, 9 May 1986), Yeldham J had reached a similar conclusion in relation to similar provisions in the Poisons Act 1966. 

104The decision in Carey is about no more and no less than the meaning of the word ""supply"" as it appears in the exception (in para (a)) to the deeming provision enacted by s 29. Section 29 does three things. First, it creates a presumption, adverse to a person shown to be in possession of more than the traffickable quantity of a prohibited drug (ie that the drugs are in possession for supply to another). Second, s 29, in paras (a) and (b), creates two exceptions to that presumption. The relevant exception is that created by para (a): that the person had the drugs in his or her possession otherwise than for supply. Third, it casts the onus of proving that the exception applies on the accused person. It is commonly said that sub-paras (a) and (b) provide statutory defences, where the evidence otherwise would be sufficient, by reason of the presumption created by the opening words of s 29, and by reason of the extended definition of ""supply"" in s 3, to establish possession for the purpose of supplying to another. Carey explains that what is meant by ""supply"" in the statutory defence includes its ordinary meaning (of furnishing or providing something needed or required by its recipient) as well as the extended s 3 meaning. 

105All the decision in Carey does is to confirm that, where an accused person adduces evidence capable, if it is accepted, of proving that he or she had the relevant quantity of drugs in possession otherwise than for supply, that question must be left to the jury for determination. Whether the evidence in any trial is capable of raising that issue will be a matter for individual determination in all the circumstances of the individual case. Carey does not create or state any new principle or proposition of law; it clarifies the meaning of ""supply"" in s 29(a). 

106The principle of Carey is that, where the evidence in a trial permits a finding that the physical possession or control of drugs by a person is transitory (that is, where that person is ""a temporary minder"" of the drug: see R v Frazer [2002] NSWCCA 59; 128 A Crim R 89 at p 91), then the jury must be directed accordingly. 

107What was stated in Carey has been applied in a number of subsequent cases. I will defer for the moment further consideration of those cases. 

108""Supply"" is, as mentioned above, in s 3 given a definition that is considerably wider than its ordinary meaning. But the extended definition is not without any boundaries. In relation to the s 3 definition, in Carey , Hunt J said: 

""None of the various limbs of that extended definition would include the mere return of the drugs to their owner or to the person reasonably believed to be the owner. References to 'sending, forwarding, delivering' are all qualified by the words 'for supply'. 

The word 'supply', however, retains its ordinary meaning as well as the extended meaning for which that inclusive definition provides. The various dictionary meanings of the word are generally agreed as being to furnish or to provide something which is needed or wanted or required by the person to whom it is given. They do not suggest that the use of the word is appropriate when that something is merely returned to its owner or the person reasonably believed to be its owner."" (p 294 F-G) 

109The question for this Court is whether the evidence given by the appellant was sufficient to call for the s 29(a) defence (or exception) to have been left to the jury for determination; that is, whether her Honour was in error in declining to take that course. It is necessary to bear in mind that the s 29(a) defence or exception was, to the extent that it was raised at all, raised only in relation to the traffickable, but relatively smaller, quantity of drugs in the purse. The appellant, in denying any knowledge of the drugs under the back seat, made no claim that she possessed them otherwise than for supply. 

110The decision in Carey has been invoked, and considered, in a number of appeals to this Court, to which both counsel referred. It is fair, I think, to say that its application depends upon the final analysis of the evidence in the trial. Cases in which it has been held that the defence was available on the evidence, and ought to have been left, include R v EAS, unreported NSWCCA, 26 July 1990; R v Tuckey, unreported, NSWCCA 11 May 1991; R v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120; R v Fong (unreported NSWCCA, 29 November 1996; R v Frazer [2002] NSWCCA 59; 128 A Crim R 89. It is unnecessary to say more about EAS ; the case was heard in conjunction with Carey , with which it was said to be ""on all fours"" and judgment was given immediately after the judgment in Carey . 

111It has been held not to have been available in R v Small , unreported NSWCCA, 31 May 1991; R v Asim , unreported, NSWCCA, 3 March 1997; R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78. 

112In Frazer , the appellant, a 38 year old woman, was one of three people in a motor vehicle driven by the appellant's boyfriend. The vehicle was stopped by police who announced that they intended to search the vehicle as they suspected that it was carrying prohibited drugs. The search revealed a number of capsules in the vehicle itself. 

113When female police officers told the appellant that they proposed to conduct a search of her, and asked her if she had anything to disclose, she told them that she had ""a bubble"" but she did not know what it contained. It was concealed in the front of her pants. When asked why it had been there concealed, she did not respond, but produced a container that proved to contain a quantity of methylamphetamine. In an interview, the appellant told police that she had found the container in a public street, but had not opened it, and did not know what was in it. In answer to a direct question, she said that she had not been given the item by anybody else. 

114In her trial, the appellant gave very different evidence. She said that she was travelling with her boyfriend at his request, but that, prior to departure, had taken an analgesic because of a headache, as a result of which she became quite drowsy. She said that she partially woke when the car was parked in a service station and that her boyfriend woke and asked her to take and ""put away"" a ""bubble-like container"". She said that she had intended to return the capsule to her boyfriend once he had paid for petrol. She fell asleep, and then became aware that her boyfriend was telling her that the police were following them. 

115She gave an explanation for the earlier version she had given. 

116The issue on appeal in Frazer was not whether the evidence adequately raised an issue concerning s 29(a), but whether the jury had been adequately directed with respect to what it was held had been clearly enough raised in the appellant's evidence. The Court held that it had not been sufficiently explained and ordered a new trial. The reasoning in Frazer casts no light on the present issue. 

117Liberti was a somewhat curious case. The appellant had entered a plea of guilty to two counts of supplying a prohibited drug (amphetamine). There was no evidence of actual supply; the prosecution relied upon the deeming effect of s 29. An agreed statement of facts was put before the sentencing court. The statement of facts included information that a search of the appellant's home had produced a quantity of amphetamine concealed in a light fitting, and that, on interview by police, the appellant had said that he was minding the drug for a friend whom he knew to be a supplier. He refused to name the friend, but said that the friend had asked him to take care of the drug because he was afraid that his own house might be searched. The appellant said that he was to return the drug to its owner at a later date. 

118In that case the Crown conceded that, notwithstanding the plea of guilty, he could not and should not have been convicted because the agreed statement of facts was insufficient to sustain a conviction in the circumstances. This Court accepted that concession as properly made. Liberti casts no light on the present issue. 

119In Tuckey , the appellant was the proprietor of a ""clothing studio"". Police attended and asked him if he had any drugs in his possession. He disclosed that a sideboard contained a package of cocaine. Of this, he told police: 

""A person owed me some money and he asked me to keep it until he could give me the money."" 

120In evidence on his trial, he gave a slightly expanded account to the same effect, saying that a man called ""Nigel"" had come to the studio and selected some clothing he wished to buy, worth about $950. He said that he had no money with him but would return with the money, and wanted to take the clothing with him. Eventually, after some argument, ""Nigel"" gave the appellant a bag of cocaine as ""collateral"", telling him that it was worth more than the value of the clothing. ""Nigel"" left and never returned. The appellant said he thought that ""Nigel"" would return and said that he was not going to do anything with the cocaine. 

121This trial took place before the decision in Carey was delivered and the trial judge gave directions not in accordance with Carey , but, in fact, in accordance with a contrary decision of the House of Lords which this Court in Carey declined to follow ( Maginnis [1987] AC 303; and see Carey at 295F - 297A). 

122This Court held that a direction in accordance with Carey ought to have been given. For reasons upon which it is not necessary to elaborate, the Court declined to order a new trial and entered a verdict of acquittal. Toohey was an instance of the application of Carey , on the specific evidence addressed in the trial. 

123Fong is another curious case. The allegation against him was that a substantial quantity of heroin had been found secreted in premises occupied by him. Police gave evidence that, in a conversation with Fong, he claimed that he had been asked to look after the drug, and had had it for three days, but declined to name the owner. On those facts, it was held, a Carey direction would be called for. The curiosity is that, in the trial, Fong gave evidence denying that conversation, and denying any knowledge of the heroin. The Court held that a s 29(a) defence could be established by evidence in the Crown case, as well as in the defence case, and that the conversation attributed to Fong by police was a sufficient basis for the jury to accept that he was in possession of the drug otherwise than for supply. The jury having been expressly directed in a contrary way, the Court upheld the appeal ordered a new trial. 

124On the other hand, there are cases in which it has been held that the facts do not justify a direction based on Carey . In Asim , the appellant, who had been found in possession of heroin, said in evidence that he had intended to return the drug to the person whom he believed was entitled to it. However, he also said that he intended to use the drug as ""leverage"" to persuade another person to repay a debt which he owed to the appellant. At trial it was held, in effect, that possession for such a purpose amounted to possession for supply, and did not come within the s 29(a) exception. That ruling was upheld on appeal to this Court. 

125In Blair, a quantity of drugs was found in a freezer in the appellant's home. Initially, he said he had no idea what it was. When asked if he could say who owned the drug, he said that he could, but declined to do so. He then told police that a friend from South Australia, whom he declined to name, had asked him to drive to Coogee to collect a parcel. (The appellant was a courier by occupation.) He went to Coogee, was approached by a person who identified him, and handed him three bags of white powder. He took this home and put it in the freezer in containers. He did not know what it was, but suspected it may have been heroin. Neither the friend from South Australia nor anybody on his behalf had come to collect the substance. 

126This Court held that the facts as alleged by that appellant could not come within the Carey principle. The Court quoted and adopted a passage in Carey to which I have not previously alluded. Hunt J added: 

""I should also refer to one very common situation which that construction [of supply] should not be understood as including. That is the situation where one person has obtained a quantity of drugs on behalf of another person or on behalf of a group of persons (which may or may not include himself) and where he transfers physical control of those drugs (or some portion of them) to that other person or to those other persons. That is in no sense analogous to the 'bailment' situation as is that with which the present appeal is concerned, and in my view such a situation would necessarily fall within the ordinary meaning of the word 'supply'."" 

127In Blair , Grove J, with whom James and Barr JJ agreed, said: 

""16 The appellant's assertion of facts, if accepted, would fall within that situation which is expressly distinguished from that of Ms Carey. The appellant received the drugs from the Coogee man on behalf of the South Australian man. He was not a receiver of them from the latter as a mere custodian but was a link in a chain of intended supply commencing with the man at Coogee and passing through the appellant's possession ultimately to the man from South Australia. That does not demonstrate a possession by the appellant 'otherwise than for the purpose of supply'."" 

128From the above review of cases, it can be seen that whether a Carey direction ought to be given or not depends upon a close analysis of the evidence, whether given by an accused person in the trial, or by way of response to police questioning, or that otherwise emerges during the course of the trial. Fine distinctions may emerge. Based on Blair , for example, a distinction may be drawn between a passive custodian, and a custodian who becomes part of the supply chain. It is therefore necessary to analyse in a little more depth the considerable complications that attended the trial of the appellant. 

129The sole allegation against the appellant (and Schirmer) was of supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, constituted by their joint possession of the entire quantity of that drug found in the car, both in the appellant's purse, and in the back seat. The charge did not distinguish between the two separate packages. Neither quantity alone was sufficient to constitute a large commercial quantity. A large commercial quantity is one kilogram: the drug found in the back of the car, at 973.5 grams, fell short of that quantity. It was more than sufficient to constitute a commercial quantity, of 250 grams. It was only in combining that quantity with the 27.3 grams in the brown paste, and the 102 grams in the tablets (the drug contained in the purse), that the quantity could be made to exceed one kilogram. 

130Thus, in order to prove the appellant guilty of the supply of the large commercial quantity, it would be necessary that the Crown prove that she (knowingly) had possession of both the drug in the purse and the drug under the back seat, and that she knew that, in total, it amounted to one kilogram or more. 

131There was no difficulty in proving the appellant's possession of the drug in the purse; she admitted as much in her evidence. Her position on appeal is that her defence to that (which was never as clearly articulated by her as it might have been) was that, in accordance with Carey , she was a mere transitory custodian of the drug, which she held on behalf of Schirmer (and would return to him, or at his direction). Examination of her evidence, however, reveals that she never explicitly, or indeed, by any clear implication, made that claim. At most, she said (in chief) that Schirmer had asked her to put the drugs in her handbag to carry to the car. In cross-examination by counsel for Schirmer, she repeatedly denied that the drugs were hers. In cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, she said that she did not know what Schirmer (or his mates) intended doing with them. But she made no mention of her own intention with respect to the future disposal of the drugs. 

132This is some way short of claiming transitory possession with the intention of returning the drugs to their owner. 

133The appellant was represented at trial by counsel who was, if the transcript is a fair indication, alert to the various issues that arose. She was certainly aware of the Carey issue; she asked for a direction in accordance with that decision, and also mentioned Liberti . She did not ask the appellant the critical question. 

134Hock DCJ was correct to decline to direct the jury in accordance with Carey . 

135The appellant also denied outright all knowledge of the larger quantity of the drug in the back of the car. That made it impossible for her to raise a Carey defence in relation to that quantity: R v Small (1991) 54 A Crim R 460. The judgment in Small makes it quite clear that where an accused person denies knowledge of the presence of a drug, there is no evidentiary basis to establish possession for a purpose other than for supply. 

136It is clear that the jury rejected the appellant's denial of knowledge of the drug under the back seat of the car. Had they not done so, they could not have found her guilty of supply of not less than the commercial quantity. They would have been left only with the much smaller quantity contained in her purse, which was significantly less than the 250 grams required to establish a commercial quantity. 

137Given the different position adopted by the appellant in relation to the two quantities of drugs, it was necessary to differentiate between those in the directions to the jury. It is necessary now to analyse with some particularity the jury's verdict. 

138The possibilities are: 

1. the jury accepted that the appellant was in (knowing) possession of the drugs in the purse. (That the jury was so satisfied is, given the evidence, highly likely, virtually inevitable.) In that case (subject to s 29(a) and Carey ), it would find her guilty of the supply of not less than the traffickable quantity; 

2. the jury accepted that the appellant was in (knowing) possession of the drugs under the back seat of the car (rejecting her evidence that she did not know of their presence), but not of the drugs in her purse. In that case it would find her guilty of supply of not less than the commercial quantity; 

3. the jury accepted that the appellant was in knowing possession of both quantities of drugs. In that case (again, subject to s 29(a) and Carey in relation to the drugs in the purse) it would find her guilty of supply of the large commercial quantity. 

139The only way in which the jury could arrive at a verdict of not guilty of supplying the large commercial quantity, but guilty of the supply of the commercial quantity, was by applying, even in the absence of instruction, the Carey principle - that is, accepting that the appellant held the drugs in the purse on behalf of Schirmer. 

140There is no other basis on which the appellant could have been found guilty of the offence of which she was convicted. In this respect, the conviction of Schirmer on the charge on the indictment is of some relevance. That verdict is consistent with the jury accepting that the drugs in the purse were his, held by the appellant on his behalf, and that the larger quantity in the car was in the joint possession of the two accused. 

141In her sentencing remarks, the trial judge said: 

""In Ms Alliston's case there are two bases on which the jury could have reached its verdict, the first is that she was not in possession of the drugs in the handbag. However, in the light of the jury's notice, MFI 39, in my view it is more probable that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she knew, or was aware, that there was a significant or real chance that the amount was more than the large commercial quantity. I propose to sentence her on that basis."" 

142I am unable to accept this construction of the verdict. The note did not differentiate between the two accused. There was no basis in the evidence for concluding that the appellant might not have known of the presence of sufficient of the drug to constitute the large commercial quantity, but did know of the presence of sufficient to constitute a commercial quantity. 

143It is also of some relevance to note that, during the course of argument at a very late stage, after the final addresses of counsel, the judge commented on how ""extraordinarily attentive"" the jury had been (AB 961). I would reject grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal. 

Ground 3 

144The complaint in relation to this ground is based upon the document provided to the jury, entitled ""Possible Verdicts""; specifically, that only three possible verdicts were identified. Omitted from the jury's consideration was a verdict of not guilty of any offence. 

145The first possible verdict specified on the document was of ""Guilty or Not Guilty of the charge on the indictment"" - that is, of supply of the large commercial quantity of the drug. The subsequent possible verdicts were, in descending order of seriousness, of Not Guilty of that charge, but Guilty of the lesser offence of supplying a commercial quantity; or of Not Guilty of the offence on the indictment, but Guilty of supply (quantity unspecified, and therefore less than the traffickable quantity). 

146As I have indicated in my consideration of grounds 1 and 2, the second alternative could only have been reached by finding the appellant guilty of knowing possession of the drugs under the back seat, but excluding those in the purse. 

147But the current question is whether a fourth alternative - not guilty of any offence - ought to have been included in the document. Perhaps it would have been better if it had, although that did not suggest itself to either counsel at the trial. It is also necessary to have regard to the oral directions. These were as follows: 

""Firstly, the accused is guilty or not guilty of the charge on the indictment, as I have just said. For the accused to be guilty of the charge on the indictment the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt of all seven elements, including large commercial quantity, element 6, and large commercial quantity, element 7. 

To find the accused not guilty of the charge on the indictment effectively means that you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he or she had possession of any of the drugs in the car. In other words the Crown would fail at that very fourth element. Then if the Crown fails on the fourth element that is the end of your deliberations in respect of that accused. ..."" 

148Thereafter, her Honour reiterated the content of the written directions and then said: 

""Both accused, as you know, deny all knowledge of the drugs in the back of the car. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either accused, when you are considering each case, knew anything about the drugs in the back of the car, your verdict would be not guilty of the charge on the indictment, but guilty of supplying a prohibited drug. If you are satisfied that the accused knew something about the drugs in the bag, or was in possession of the drugs in the bag, there are a number of different possibilities, of course, depending upon your findings in respect of the evidence about the two discrete quantities of drugs and that is why it is a little bit complicated for you. 

Your findings may involve, as I am sure you are aware, that both accused knew about all the drugs. That one accused knew about the drugs in the back of the car and the other did not. That one accused knew about the drugs in the purse and other did not. There are a number of combinations. For that matter, that neither of the accused knew anything about the drugs in the car. They are all matters that you have to decide as your role as judges of the facts."" 

149In my opinion, the jury could not have been under any misapprehension that an outright acquittal was one of the alternative verdicts available. Had the possibility of such misapprehension been a realistic one, it would have been apparent to one or both counsel. The directions, taken in conjunction with the oral directions, were adequate. 

150I would reject this ground of appeal. 

151With respect to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 

152FULLLERTON J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J. 

153In so far as grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal against conviction concern the trial judge's refusal to direct the jury in accordance with the decision in Carey, I agree with McClellan CJ at CL at [34] that there was a sufficient foundation in the appellant's evidence as to the circumstances in which she came to be in possession of the drugs in her purse for the jury to consider whether her possession of those drugs was as a mere custodian and, if so, to conclude that her possession was otherwise than for the purposes of supply. While I accept Simpson J's analysis of the collected authorities and her Honour's observation at [75] that, depending upon the facts in a particular case, fine distinctions may emerge between a passive custodian and a custodian who intends to become or does become part of a supply chain, I am also of the view that, in this case, whether the appellant was a mere custodian was a jury question obliging the trial judge to give the direction sought by her counsel. 

154The question that then arises is whether the consequence of upholding those grounds of appeal necessitates ordering a new trial. In my view it does not, there being no miscarriage of justice. The appellant faced one charge on the indictment, namely supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine which is specified under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act at 1 kg. In the way the Crown conducted its case at trial, a conviction on that charge necessitated the jury being satisfied that the appellant was in possession (for supply) of the drugs in the purse (totaling 129.3 grams) and the drugs in the back seat (totaling 973.5 grams), since it was only by the combined weight of those discrete packages that the total weight of the drugs exceeded 1 kg. The appellant was acquitted on that charge and convicted of the statutory alternative of supply of a commercial quantity of that drug, specified under the Act as 250 grams. Whether the verdict was because the jury were in doubt as to whether she knew or was aware that the combined weight of all the drugs exceeded 1 kg (the view of the trial judge and adopted by McClellan CJ at CL at [37]) or whether it was as a result of the jury accepting that the drugs in her purse were not for supply despite the absence of instruction on the basis of Carey (the preferred analysis of Simpson J), the jury must have rejected the appellant's claim that she had no knowledge of the drugs under the back seat. The trial judge's failure to direct on the Carey principle cannot affect that finding. In those circumstances there is no utility to ordering a new trial. 

155I agree with his Honour that leave should be refused to raise ground 3 and that ground 4 is not made out. I agree that leave to appeal is granted but that the appeal should be dismissed. I also agree with his Honour that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

2708735,WINDLE v R [2011] NSWCCA 277,"Judgment 

1MEAGHER JA: I agree with Hoeben J 
2HOEBEN J: 
Offence and sentence 
On 12 November 2010 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Gosford Local Court to the offence of robbery, contrary to s94 of the Crimes Act 1900 in that on 7 April 2010 at Shelly Beach he did rob Kenneth Raymond Nipsalla of $18,000. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 14 years. When the matter came before his Honour Judge King SC on 3 February 2011 the applicant adhered to his plea of guilty. 

3His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing 3 February 2011 and expiring 2 August 2013 with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months expiring 2 February 2015. 

4The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the severity of the sentence on the following grounds: 

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in concluding that he was unable to find any acceptable evidence of remorse or contrition in that the judge: 
(i) Failed to properly assess remorse expressed in evidence by the applicant at the proceedings on sentence. 
(ii) Failed to properly consider the remorse demonstrated as a result of a plea of guilty; and 
(iii) Took into account the fact that the applicant had refused to name his co-offenders as going to the issue of remorse and contrition. 

Ground 2: The sentence was in all the circumstances manifestly excessive. 

Factual background 

5At the time of the offence, the applicant was subject to a good behaviour bond pursuant to s9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The good behaviour bond was for 12 months commencing 19 January 2010 and was imposed by the Gosford Local Court as part of a sentence for the offence of larceny. 

6The victim was aged 63 and conducted a business known as ""Nippi Consulting Pty Ltd"". Through that business the victim employed 40 persons in relation to the collection of shopping trolleys at shopping centres at various places in New South Wales. 

7The company paid wages fortnightly on Wednesdays with the majority of employees being paid in cash. The victim's system was to withdraw cash from banks at Bateau Bay and then to pay the wages to the company's Central Coast employees. His procedure to obtain the cash, divide it and pay it to the employees was widely known to the employees of the company. 

8The applicant had previously been employed by the company as a trolley collector for 3 years. His employment was terminated in July 2009. 

9On 7 April 2010 the victim withdrew a total of $27,000 in cash to pay the wages. $18,000 of that cash was placed in a cloth bank bag. On collecting the cash, the victim paid a number of employees in the vicinity of the bank, including a Mr Robertson. By the time the victim left the bank area, he still had approximately $21,000 in cash, $3,500 of that in his pocket and $18,000 in the bag. 

10The victim gave Robertson a lift to his home. After dropping off his belongings, Robertson accompanied the victim as the victim drove to his daughter's home in Shelly Beach. It was at these premises that the victim intended to divide the wages and put the cash into separate envelopes to pay the employees. 

11When they arrived, Robertson alighted from the vehicle and walked towards the victim's son-in-law, Jason Miller. The victim went from the driver's seat to the rear driver's side door to retrieve a number of envelopes on the backseat. He had the $18,000 in the bag under his arm. As he was leaning in, he was pushed in the back by someone and the bag was snatched from under his arm. He fell face first onto the rear seat of the car. 

12The victim observed the person who had pushed him running away towards a maroon four-wheel drive vehicle. The victim alerted his son-in-law, Miller, who chased the male person as he was running towards the vehicle. The male person was observed to jump into the front passenger seat of that vehicle and it immediately sped off west along Shelly Beach Road. 

13Just before the incident, another of the victim's employees had arrived in his vehicle at the daughter's home to collect his pay. That person, Wayne Byth, witnessed the robbery and saw the male person run past his car. Byth drove after the maroon four-wheel drive vehicle, pulling up next to Miller to allow him to get into the car. Miller and Byth then followed the four-wheel drive through a number of streets. 

14Eventually they managed to drive in front of it so as to prevent it from proceeding further. Miller and Byth got out and approached the four-wheel drive. As they did so, they recognised the applicant as the driver. Miller grabbed the applicant by his shirt and said a couple of times ""Give back the money"" while shaking him. The male who had snatched the bag was sitting in the front passenger seat and there was a further unknown male in the rear of the four-wheel drive. 

15While Miller was holding onto the applicant, the applicant revved the four-wheel drive and managed to reverse away. Miller and Byth got back into Byth's car and again attempted to pursue the four-wheel drive vehicle. Eventually they lost sight of it. They returned to the victim's daughter's premises and told the victim of their identification of the applicant. 

16The victim reported the offence to the police. He then rang the applicant on his mobile phone and on a number of occasions requested that the applicant return the money. The applicant denied any knowledge of the money, or the robbery. 

17At about 3.40pm on the day of the robbery, the police located the applicant and spoke to him. He denied any involvement in the offence and claimed that he had been home all day. The applicant was then arrested, conveyed to the Gosford Police Station and informed of his rights. In due course he was charged with the offence and granted bail. The police were unable to locate any of the $18,000 cash that had been taken. No repayment of any of the stolen money had been made at the time that his Honour passed sentence. 

18The police were unable to identify the other two persons involved in the offence. The applicant provided no information to the police in relation to the identity of those two persons. 

19A victim impact statement was placed before the Court. It revealed that the victim had been released from hospital four days before the robbery, having had stents inserted because of heart problems. At the time of the robbery, he not only suffered from significant heart problems, but had also been diagnosed with lung cancer. 

20The loss of the $18,000 in cash placed him in significant difficulty in relation to paying his employees, all of whom were persons who ""lived from week to week and needed their money for rent and food"". The victim eventually was able to pay his employees by calling on friends to lend him money and taking on debt as a result. As of the sentencing date, the victim was still paying back the money which he had borrowed. 

21The financial hardship brought about by the robbery caused the victim to move his family to a smaller and cheaper house because he could no longer afford the premises that he had been renting. As a result of one long outstanding account, which he could not meet, he was declared a bankrupt. 

Remarks on sentence 

22His Honour reviewed the factual background to the offence as indicated above. When referring to the fact that the applicant had not identified his co-offenders, his Honour said: 

""The offender has provided no information to the police in relation to the identity of any other person involved in the offence, which of course means that there could be no consideration of any discount on sentence for assistance. The fact that he has not identified any co-offender or possible co-offender does not of course increase the penalty to be imposed. It is, however, also relevant to the question of remorse and contrition, which I will deal with later."" (ROS 5.8) 

23The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. In that evidence he accepted that of the three persons involved in the robbery, it was he who had knowledge of the victim's procedures in relation to the payment of employees, as a result of his past employment. He accepted that he used that knowledge to plan the commission of the offence with the assistance of his co-offenders. 

24His Honour noted that the applicant was not the person who actually snatched the bag from the victim. His Honour concluded that there was a good reason for this. Had he done so he would immediately have been recognised by the victim. This meant that he needed the assistance of at least one other person who was unknown to the victim to effect the offence. 

25While there was no injury to the victim, his Honour assessed the offence as a serious example of such offences. In reaching that conclusion, his Honour took into account the amount which was stolen, the planning and the use of the applicant's prior knowledge which involved a breach of trust on his part. 

26His Honour then analysed the applicant's subjective case. He was aged 48 and had one child aged 22. The child was the result of a relationship between the applicant and Ms Godden, an Aboriginal Liaison Officer with the Department of Education and Training. Ms Godden gave evidence on sentence. Their relationship had broken up as a result of the applicant's alcohol addiction when the child was aged 2. Some 7 years before the proceedings, they became re-acquainted and the applicant had been residing in the same premises as Ms Godden and his son, but not in terms of a new relationship between himself and Ms Godden. 

27The applicant gave evidence that he committed the offence to acquire money to spend on his amphetamine addiction, which had existed for approximately 12 years. He said that at the time of the offence, his amphetamine addiction was costing $400 per day. The applicant did not explain how he could afford such an addiction when apart from the proceeds of the robbery, his only income was from a disability pension. The applicant said that of the $18,000, he only received $6,000 which he spent on drugs. 

28Apart from the 3 years that the applicant spent working for the victim, there was no evidence of any other previous work history. 

29There was medical evidence before the Court that the applicant suffered ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic lower back pain and an anxiety disorder. The ischaemic heart disease was apparently irreversible and restricted the applicant's ability to engage in heavy work. His chronic obstructive lung disease was due to a long-term addiction to cigarettes since his early teenage years. 

30His Honour concluded that all of these conditions could adequately be treated within a custodial situation. Ms Godden said that she remained supportive of the applicant and would endeavour to remain supportive of him when released, provided that he participated in appropriate programs to deal with his drug problem. She said that she had tried to get him into rehabilitation in the past, but without success. 

31In relation to the applicant's amphetamine addiction, his Honour said: 

""The offender has had his amphetamine addiction for some 12 years. Despite being before the court from time to time in respect of drug-related offences, it does not appear that he has ever made any genuine effort on his own behalf to obtain any treatment or assistance in respect of that addiction prior to committing this offence."" (ROS 10.8) 

32Prior to sentencing, the applicant had applied to be admitted to the Glenn Residential Rehabilitation Centre, but his application had been rejected. 

33The applicant had a criminal history which commenced when he was a juvenile and had continued into adulthood. There had been periods when the applicant was apparently able to stay out of trouble with the law for a number of consecutive years. His offending largely related to matters of violence, prohibited drugs, being in possession of goods suspected of being stolen and larceny. His Honour regarded these offences as falling within the lower range of seriousness in that they had all been dealt with in the Local Court and only bonds, community service and fines had been imposed. 

34His Honour regarded the fact that the offence occurred while the applicant was subject to a s9 good behaviour bond as a significant aggravating factor. 

35In relation to remorse, his Honour said: 

""There is nothing in the pre-sentence report which indicates that the offender has expressed any remorse or contrition for his offending behaviour. In his evidence on sentence when asked by Mr Bickford his solicitor about having committed the offence, he said that he had committed the robbery and that he was sorry he had done it. When asked how he felt about the fact that he was robbing other peoples' wages he said ""I realise it was wrong, I wouldn't have liked it done to me"". 

Other than acknowledging that he should not have done it and ""would not have liked it done to me"" there was little evidence of remorse or contrition contained in the offender's statement. A plea of guilty itself does not necessarily indicate either remorse or contrition."" (ROS 12.3) 

36In relation to remorse, his Honour also noted that although the offence was committed on 7 April 2010 and the applicant knew he had been identified, he proceeded to take the benefit of his offence by spending at least $6000 of the victim's money to satisfy his addiction. In that regard, his Honour noted that the applicant had not repaid the victim any of the money stolen. His Honour also noted that when Ms Godden gave her evidence, she did not say anything about the applicant having expressed any remorse or contrition to her. 

37His Honour expressed his conclusions as to remorse as follows: 

""The court is unable to find, in the circumstances, that there is any acceptable evidence of remorse or contrition. Nor can it be said, in the absence of any treatment or counselling to this time, that there is a good prospect of the offender being rehabilitated in the sense of being able to deal with his current drug addiction."" (ROS 13.7) 

38His Honour then referred to the purposes of sentencing and noted that general deterrence had an important part to play in this matter. In respect of aggravating features, his Honour said: 

""I note that the offender was on conditional liberty at the time of committing the offence and that the offender's prior criminal history does not increase the seriousness of the offence, but is relevant to such issues as retribution, deterrence and the protection of society. That is, the sentence is not increased because he has a criminal history but his criminal history is relevant also to the question of any possible amelioration."" 

39His Honour allowed a 25 percent discount because of the applicant's early plea of guilty. 

APPEAL 
Ground of Appeal 1 

40The applicant submitted that contrary to his Honour's findings, he had given evidence which demonstrated remorse in that he said he was sorry he had committed the offence, he knew he was taking wages from people, he realised it was wrong, he would not have liked someone else to do it to him, and he did not realise the victim had cancer and was sorry about that. 

41Implicit in that submission is the unstated premise that his Honour was obliged to accept what was said as evidence of genuine remorse. That is not the law. While it was open to his Honour to accept the evidence, he was not obliged to do so. This is particularly so when his Honour had the advantage of seeing and hearing the applicant give his evidence which this Court does not. 

42His Honour's acceptance or rejection of this evidence was essentially a discretionary matter and the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505 apply. No error of the kind referred to in House v The King has been identified. 

43In any event, the evidence to which the applicant has referred is at best oblique. There was no statement in terms which would constitute a clear assertion of remorse and contrition and no evidence of conduct which supported the truth of such an assertion. 

44In that regard, the observations of Buddin J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreed) in Alvares & Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33 are of assistance. 

""44 The issue which presently falls to be considered arose because each of the applicants was endeavouring to persuade the sentencing judge, with a view to ameliorating the otherwise appropriate sentence, that he was remorseful, and genuinely so. Remorse in this context means regret for the wrongdoing which the offender's actions have caused because it can be safely assumed that an offender will always regret the fact that he or she has been apprehended. Remorse is but one feature of post offence conduct upon which an offender may seek to rely as a matter which has the potential to mitigate penalty. The manner in which the issue of remorse is approached is not unique to either the sentencing process or to the courtroom. Indeed, it is a common feature of everyday existence. Ordinary human experience would suggest that it is only natural that a person who is committed some misdeed would wish to make the most favourable impression possible in seeking to make amends for it. It is unsurprising that such a person would also wish to maximise the prospect that his or her expression of remorse was seen as genuine by the person or persons whose task it was to determine the appropriate sanction for the misdeed. Such an outcome is likely to be assessed as having increased prospects if the expression of remorse, whether it be by deed or word, is communicated directly, rather than indirectly to those responsible for determining the sanction. By the same token, an assessment of the genuineness of the remorse by the person or persons to whom it is expressed, is likely to be better informed in circumstances in which it is expressed directly, that is face to face. That is because remorse is an intrinsically subjective matter, the evaluation of which depends upon the subtleties of human interaction."" 

45The applicant submitted that his Honour should have given greater weight to the fact that he had entered a plea of guilty at an early point in time as indicative of remorse. The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in taking into account as a relevant consideration that the plea had been entered some 6 months after the charge was laid. 

46His Honour's statement that ""A plea of guilty itself does not necessarily indicate either remorse or contrition"" is a correct statement of principle. In R v Winchester (1992) 38 A Crim R 345 at 360 Hunt CJ at CL observed that the extent to which a plea of guilty evidences remorse and contrition so as to attract leniency, depends to a large degree upon whether or not the plea resulted from a recognition of the inevitable. See also Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121 at [48]. 

47On that issue, the strength of the Crown case is relevant to the evaluation of remorse and in that context what weight should be given to a plea of guilty in determining the appropriate sentence: R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12]. His Honour specifically addressed the question of the strength of the Crown case. His Honour pointed out that the applicant had been clearly identified by two persons at the time of the offence. It is clear that his Honour held the view that the Crown case was a strong one and that the applicant's plea of guilty was not necessarily indicative of any contrite attitude towards the offence as distinct from a recognition of the inevitable. Not only was that conclusion open on the evidence, it was the more likely of the inferences available. 

48Against that background, it was not erroneous for his Honour to take into account that the plea was entered 6 months after the applicant had been charged as a factor in determining the genuineness of remorse and contrition. The corollary is that an admission of guilt much closer to the commission of the offence than to the sentencing proceedings is capable of demonstrating genuine remorse. 

49The applicant's final submission on this issue was that his Honour erred in treating the applicant's reluctance to identify his co-offenders as indicative of the absence of remorse and contrition. In that regard, the applicant referred to the remarks of Simpson J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Hall J agreed) in Pham v R [2010] NSWCCA 208 where her Honour said: 

""27 I do accept that it was erroneous to treat the applicant's reluctance to identify his co-offenders as relevant to, and indicative of the absence of, remorse and contrition. As was pointed out on his behalf, there are good and well-known reasons why participants in drug offences might display that reluctance: see R v Baleisuva [2004] NSWCCA 344."" 

50A proper reading of what his Honour in fact said, does not support the submission that he treated the reluctance to identify as indicating an absence of remorse. When referring to his refusal his Honour specifically stated that this ""does not of course increase the penalty to be imposed"". When referring to its relevance to the question of remorse and contrition, his Honour said that he would deal with that later. When he did deal with remorse and contrition later in his remarks on sentence, his Honour set out clearly the bases for his decision and they did not include the applicant's refusal to name his co-offenders. Whatever his Honour's preliminary views were on that issue, by the time he came to consider remorse and contrition, he did not take that matter into account for the suggested purpose. 

51Apart from the advantage which his Honour had of seeing and hearing the applicant, the matters which he did take into account in relation to remorse, were clearly and fully set out and were relevant to that question. 

52These were the applicant's failure to express contrition and remorse in clear terms, the absence of any mention of contrition and remorse in the pre-sentence report or in the evidence of Ms Godden, the absence of any attempt to repay the victim and the delay between his arrest and the plea of guilty. These considerations justified his Honour's conclusion that there was no acceptable evidence of remorse or contrition. 

53While his Honour did not refer to them expressly, the provisions of s21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which list remorse as a mitigating factor are instructive. That subsection provides: 

""... remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if: 

(i) The offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and 

(ii) The offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both). 

54The evidence before his Honour did not satisfy those requirements. His Honour set out in clear terms why it was that he was not prepared to find remorse and contrition. No error in his Honour's approach has been established. This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground of Appeal 2 

55The applicant accepted that for him to show that the sentence was manifestly excessive it was necessary to show that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". He accepted as applicable the test in R v Vuni [2006] NSWCCA 171 where (with the agreement of Tobias JA and James J) I said: 

""33 To establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" ( Dinsdale (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325). This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle. Most pertinently the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge. ( Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 at [26] - [28])."" 

This statement of principle was recently endorsed in Stewart, Wade John v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16] - [17] and Simon Hayek v R [2010] NSWCCA 139 at [37]. 

56The applicant submitted that the offence was the non-aggravated form of robbery in that the victim was pushed and the bag snatched. The applicant submitted that he was the driver of the vehicle but was not the assailant. While accepting that a sentence of imprisonment was the only available option, the applicant submitted that the sentence imposed was excessive when looked at against the objective seriousness of the offence which was towards the lower end of the range. 

57The basis for that submission was a series of cases involving offences under s94 which, the applicant submitted, demonstrated that the sentence imposed was excessive given the absence of violence and his comparatively modest contribution to the offence. 

58The applicant provided the Court with a schedule of 40 cases relating to s94 offences which set out a brief summary of the facts and the sentences imposed. The applicant submitted that in many cases the objective seriousness of the offences in the schedule appeared to be significantly greater than that prevailing in this case, yet the sentence imposed was lower. Implicit in the submission was the proposition that by reference to those cases, the sentence imposed by his Honour was outside the appropriate range of sentences for an offence of this kind and was therefore ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". 

59When assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour had regard to the substantial sum of money taken ($18,000) and the important part played by the applicant in planning the offence because of the knowledge which he had acquired during the course of his employment by the victim. His Honour took into account that this offence involved a breach of trust. 

60His Honour took into account other considerations. The offence was aggravated because it was committed whilst the applicant was at conditional liberty being subject to a s9 bond. The applicant's previous criminal record was relevant to retribution, deterrence and the protection of society and reduced the applicant's entitlement to any leniency. His Honour's unwillingness to find remorse and contrition has already been referred to. Finally, as his Honour pointed out, there were good reasons why the applicant did not take the bag containing the money, i.e. he would have been recognised by the victim. 

61It is trite law that each case has to be considered on its own merits and no case is entirely similar to any other. There is a wide discretion to impose a sentence that seems to the judge to be just and appropriate. As was recently restated in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 when imposing a sentence the court has to take into account, not only the objective seriousness of the offence, but all of the associated circumstances. In this case, while the applicant had health issues, his subjective case was modest. 

62As the applicant acknowledged, the use of statistics is a somewhat blunt instrument when seeking to establish manifest excess. The particular difficulty was identified by Garling J in Fogg v R [2011] NSWCCA 1 at [59] [60]: 

""59 ... But for many offences, culpability varies over so wide a range that the statistics are of limited utility for a particular case: ... 

60 I accept that the statistics referred to demonstrate that the sentence in this case falls at the high end of the range of sentences imposed for the offence. But the question remains whether it falls within the range of the permissible exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion."" 

63This Court has said on a number of occasions that undue weight should not be given to sentencing statistics. This is because of the ""vast range of factors relevant to sentencing for such offences"" (RA Hulme J in Furia v R [2010] NSWCCA 326). The large number of variables is simply not reflected in statistical figures, percentages and a brief statement of the facts of the offence. 

64What is important when considering a particular sentence are the specific findings as to the objective seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the offender. These are the considerations which are determinative when assessing whether a particular sentence is manifestly excessive rather than the comparison of the sentences with statistics ( Holloway v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 23 [85]). The critical question is whether the sentence imposed was appropriate for the particular case ( R v F [2002] 132 A Crim R 308 adopted in Ayoub Omran v R; El Masri, Ali v R; [2010] NSWCCA 196 at [58]). 

65The limitations of sentencing statistics have been identified by decisions at the highest level. In Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, (2010) 85 ALJR 195 the plurality said: 

""54 In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence "" (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned."" 

... 

59 As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen , ""[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion"". And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong , appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"". Rather, as the plurality went on to say[ in Wong , ""[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"". But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition. And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that ""the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error""."" 

66The matters which his Honour took into account when imposing the sentence were relevant, cogent and compelling. Taking all of the circumstances of the offence into account, including its objective seriousness, the surrounding circumstances and the applicant's subjective case, I am not satisfied that the sentence imposed was outside the range or that error has been revealed. Most particularly, I am not satisfied that the sentence imposed is plainly unjust or unreasonable or that it is manifestly excessive. 

67This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

68The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal should be allowed, but that the appeal should be dismissed. 

69ROTHMAN J: I agree with Hoeben J.

5The effective overall sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 11 months and 7 days commencing 17 April 2009 and expiring 23 March 2013 with a head sentence of 5 years and 3 months expiring on 16 July 2014.

6The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the severity of the sentence imposed by her Honour on the following grounds.

1.Her Honour failed to properly consider the applicant's mental illness.
2.Her Honour erred in failing to backdate the commencement of the sentences beyond 17 April 2009.
3.Her Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances so as to allow the applicant to be released on parole after serving 75 percent of the overall effective sentence.
4.The sentences in respect of counts 2 and 5 are manifestly excessive.

Factual background

7The facts and circumstances giving rise to the offences were as follows:

8Count 1 - The premises at 4/485 George Street, South Windsor were a single room retail store, located within a two storey arcade. At about 4.30pm on Thursday, 18 September 2008 the store was left unattended by the victim. Before leaving, the victim had locked and secured the store. At 6.50 am on Friday, 19 September the victim returned to the store and saw that the glass entry door was partly open and that there was an 8 centimetre hole smashed in the glass. The victim found that one laptop computer, three computer monitors and various computer accessories were missing. The total value of the items taken was $2,500.

9The police established that the applicant smashed a small hole in the front glass door of the premises which he utilised to manipulate the lock and enter the store. Once inside the store, the applicant stole the items specified. When a forensic examination was carried out of the store, a red stain was located on a laminated sign inside the glass of the entry door. The sample of the stain was taken and analysed which revealed DNA matching that of the applicant.

10Count 2 - At about 10.30am on Saturday 11 October 2008 the victim left her home in Castlereagh Road, Agnes Banks and locked and secured the premises. When she returned at about 6pm, she observed the front door to be ajar and found that eight rooms of the house had been ransacked. A large amount of electrical items, jewellery and other household items were missing from the home. The total value of the missing items was $37,535.

11The police established that the applicant forced open the front door and entered the house and ransacked the eight rooms taking property belonging to the victim. The victim reported the matter to the police and a forensic examination of the house was conducted. During that examination, two fingerprints were located on an Ipod box inside the premises. Those fingerprints were collected and resulted in identification of the fingerprint profile of the applicant.

12Count 3 and Count 4 - At 9am on 19 October 2008 the victim left his premises at Cattai Ridge Road, Glenorie unattended prior to which he had locked and secured those premises. At about 3pm the victim returned and observed his front gates to be open and that his black quad bike was missing from underneath the front verandah.

13When the victim walked to the rear of the house, he saw that a rear window had been smashed. He observed that the house alarm had been activated. He could not identify any property missing from within the house. 

14Police established that between 9am and 3pm on 19 October the applicant entered the property and stole the quad bike. They established that he smashed the rear window of the premises and entered the house. Once he entered the house, the burglar alarm was activated and he then exited the premises without taking any property.

15When the victim reported the matter to the police, an examination of the area took place. During the examination a fingerprint was located on a broken panel of glass at the rear of the house. Additionally a red stain was located on the dining room floor. Both the fingerprint and the DNA from the stain were identified as belonging to the applicant. The quad bike was not recovered and its value was assessed at $1,000.

16Count 5 - At about 11am on Saturday, 12 October 2008 the victim left her home at Ridgeline Drive, Stanhope Gardens and locked and secured the premises. When she returned at 5.30pm, she found the garage door fully opened. She also found that the main bedroom, two other bedrooms, the study and the rumpus room had been ransacked. Several pieces of jewellery were missing along with power tools. The total value of the items stolen was $30,000.

17The victim also found the rear side window open. It had been locked and secured when she left early that day. A jemmy bar was found on the lounge which did not belong to her. 

18The police established that the applicant forced open the rear side window using the jemmy bar and entered the house and ransacked the rooms taking property belonging to the victim. He left the premises by opening the garage door. When the victim reported the matter to the police an examination of the premises took place. During that examination, a fingerprint was located on the internal lower windowsill of the rear window. The fingerprint was collected, examined and identified as belonging to the applicant.

19The only information provided to her Honour concerning the Form 1 offences was that set out on the Form 1 itself. The larceny offence involved the stealing of a Sony CD player and a camera valued at $1,057. The damage to property offence involved the breaking of the window of a motor vehicle. The take and drive conveyance offence involved the stealing of a Toyota LandCruiser. The break enter and steal offence involved breaking and entering a dwelling in Panorama Crescent, Freemans Reach. The possess housebreaking implements offence involved the possession of a jemmy bar without lawful excuse. The maximum penalty for each of the first three offences was imprisonment for 5 years. The maximum penalty for the break enter offence was imprisonment for 14 years and the maximum penalty for the possession of housebreaking implements was imprisonment for 10 years.

Remarks on sentence

20Having reviewed the facts and circumstances of each offence, her Honour considered the applicant's subjective case. The applicant did not give evidence on sentence but his aunt did so. A pre-sentence report and a report from a psychiatrist retained by Justice Health were before her Honour. 

21The applicant was aged 38 at the time of sentencing. He was raised by his father and grandparents, following the breakdown of his parents' marriage. At 14 his grandmother died and in the pre-sentence report he described himself as ""going off the rails"" at that point in time. He left school in year 10 and has been largely unemployed since that time.

22The applicant has extensive criminal antecedents. As a juvenile he was dealt with for offences of assault, stealing a motor vehicle, driving offences, goods in custody and break enter and steal. As an adult he had convictions for motor vehicle theft, possessing implements to enter a conveyance, driving offences, larceny of a motor vehicle, escaping lawful custody, break enter and steal, break and enter with intent, failing to appear, drink driving, supplying false information, accessory after the fact to stealing, breaching an apprehended violence order, custody of an offensive implement, receiving, stealing, making false or misleading statements with intent, common assault, assault with intent to prevent apprehension, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and drug offences.

23The applicant has been dealt with in a variety of ways including juvenile detention, bonds, suspended sentences and fulltime custody. He was at one stage referred to the Drug Court Program. Her Honour noted that he had breached most orders made in relation to him, including parole and had three convictions for escape from custody.

24In relation to the applicant's health, her Honour said:

""He has a long history of drug abuse and schizophrenia, his drug of choice is amphetamines. At the time of his arrest he reports using an 8 ball of amphetamines injected intravenously a day. In the past he was addicted to heroin, his drug usage commenced at 14, his addiction to amphetamines commenced at 17 ... He is currently medicated with Risperidone, Zoloft and Seroquel, he is also on the methadone program. He informs Dr Samuels that six weeks prior to these offences, he ceased taking his medication and he was no longer taking methadone. ... Since he recommenced using amphetamines he reports continuing to experience some symptoms of schizophrenia. He says to those who interviewed him that his recall of these offences is at best sketchy, he had no recall of the circumstances surrounding the first offence, agreed with the police facts in respect of count 2, could recall the events surrounding counts 3 and 4, but could not recall committing count 5. ... His aunt says the offender has expressed a desire to change his ways and that he wants to better himself, she admits however that she has heard the offender say the same thing in the past. On this occasion it is her opinion that he is more motivated to try, she thinks he has developed insight into a need to maintain his medication to stabilise his mental health."" (ROS 6.5 - 7.2)

25In relation to the objective seriousness of the offence, her Honour noted that break enter and steal offences have long been regarded as serious crimes. Her Honour took into account the factors identified in the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435, (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. Her Honour specifically noted that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of these offences, i.e. on parole. He had a record for like offences. He was facing sentence for a multiplicity of offences and in respect of counts 2 and 5, jewellery was taken. Her Honour took into account that jewellery is often said to have sentimental value. Her Honour noted that the value of the items taken from the victims in counts 2 and 5 were both in excess of $30,000. Her Honour said that the applicant's previous criminal record did not aggravate the offences for which he was being sentenced, but disentitled him to leniency.

26Her Honour accepted that the applicant had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and was entitled to a 25 percent discount as a result. 

27In relation to remorse, contrition and rehabilitation her Honour said:

""As I did not hear from him on sentence it is difficult to make a finding that he is truly remorseful and contrite. His prospects for rehabilitation remain extremely guarded. It is essential he maintains his medication regime to stabilise his mental health and that he refrains from using illicit substances, either by remaining on the methadone program or abstaining totally.

He has in the past been offered significant assistance and has failed to avail himself of the opportunities afforded to him. The fact that his father and aunt remain supportive is not a matter which enhances his prospects. He was residing with his aunt when he breached his parole on the last occasion and failed to adhere to his medication regime and of course resumed abusing illicit substances."" (ROS 8.2)

28In relation to special circumstances, her Honour said:

""I'm asked to find special circumstances but I've declined to do so. The offender has been afforded ample opportunity in the past, if he is truly committed to adhering to his medical regime put in place to assist him and to abstain from illicit substances, the standard period of parole will be sufficient to ensure his compliance and to provide him with assistance with post release."" (ROS 8.9)

29In relation to the commencement of the sentences, her Honour said:

""The offender went into custody on 25 October 2008 and served his balance of parole until 17 April 2009. It is appropriate that he serve his remainder of parole before he commences to serve the sentences to be imposed for these offences. He was in breach of his parole for failing to abide by conditions of his parole in addition to committing these offences."" (ROS 9.2)

30After her Honour had imposed sentences in respect of the various counts, she was somewhat belatedly advised by the Crown of the existence of the Form 1 matters, which were attached to Count 5. When advised of that fact, her Honour re-sentenced the applicant in respect of count 5 and increased the sentence by adding 9 months to the head sentence and approximately 5 1/2 months to the non-parole period.

APPEAL
Ground 1

31The applicant submitted that although there was undisputed evidence that he had suffered from chronic schizophrenia for approximately 10 years, that factor was not properly taken into account by her Honour in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. In support of that submission, the applicant relied upon Sperling J's summary of relevant principles in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 where his Honour said:

""33Mental illness may be relevant - and was relevant in the present case - in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced. 

34Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration.

35Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person.

36A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence.""

32The applicant accepted that there was no evidence that the schizophrenia contributed towards the commission of the offences and accordingly the first consideration was not relevant. However, he submitted that the second and third considerations were relevant and had not been taken into account by her Honour. This was clear, it was submitted, when her Honour concluded that general deterrence ""looms large"" in the sentence proceedings.

33The applicant relied upon the observations of R A Hulme J in Withers v R [2009] NSWCCA 133 as limiting the application of the fourth consideration to those situations where the mental illness contributed to the commission of the offence. The observation by Hulme J was:

""35... The countervailing consideration of the protection of the community generally becomes relevant in a case in which the offender's moral culpability for the offence is reduced because of a lesser capacity to reason, or appreciate the wrongfulness of the conduct, or to exercise appropriate powers of control. In such a case the emphasis upon denunciation and general deterrence might be reduced but the protection of the community may receive greater emphasis: see Engert at 71. But these are not considerations in the present case.""

34I do not accept that last submission. The fourth consideration in Hemsley is not limited in the way submitted by the applicant. That is not the effect of what was said by Hulme J in Withers. His Honour was doing no more than pointing out how the fourth consideration could still operate despite the application of the first consideration. The relevance of the fourth consideration, albeit referring to special deterrence, in circumstances where the second and third considerations apply is obvious. Significantly, the operation of the fourth ""and countervailing consideration"" was not so qualified by Sperling J in Hemsley nor was it so qualified in the authorities to which Sperling J referred when setting out his conclusions in that case.

35As was properly conceded by the applicant, the evidence concerning the applicant's schizophrenia was limited. There was no evidence that it made any contribution to his offending, in contrast to his substance abuse which clearly did. There was no evidence that because of his schizophrenia a custodial sentence might weigh more heavily on him, nor was there any evidence that his schizophrenia might render him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. On the contrary, to the extent that there was evidence, it was to the effect that the taking of the prescribed medication would moderate the condition and that his offending was directly related to his drug abuse.

36Moreover, there is ample authority that general deterrence is not completely irrelevant even where a mental disorder is established. This is particularly so where an offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing, which seems to be the case here.

37In R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51 the applicant's psychotic state was self-induced as a result of his failure to take his medication and his deliberate taking of drugs. Hunt CJ at CL said at 52:

""By his recklessness in bringing on these psychotic episodes, [the applicant] is a continuing danger to the community, a matter which would in any event reduce - if not eradicate - the mitigation which would otherwise be given for the respondent's mental condition.""

Similar expressions of opinion are to be found in Benitez v R (2006) 160 A Crim R 166 at [41] - [42] and Cole v R [2010] NSWCCA 227 at [71] - [73].

38R v Wright was applied in Taylor v R [2006] NSWCCA 7 where McClellan CJ at CL (Howie and Latham JJ agreeing) said that because the appellant was:

""30... aware of the state he was in and the effect upon him of sleep deprivation, together with the effect of beer and marijuana, but nevertheless elected to drive, his impaired psychological state would not play a significant part in determining the ultimate sentence.""

39The evidence on this issue is all one way. The applicant had been aware of his schizophrenia for many years and had been prescribed anti-psychotic medication. The pre-sentence report and the report from Dr Samuels make it clear that over the years the applicant repeatedly ceased taking his medication and consistently engaged in substance abuse. He did so with full knowledge of the likely consequences. In those circumstances, her Honour's finding concerning general deterrence was not only open to her, it was appropriate.

40It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 2

41The applicant submits that in circumstances where:

(i)The revocation of the applicant's parole appears largely to have been attributable to the further offences taken into account on the Form 1; and

(ii)The fact that the present offences were committed while on conditional liberty was taken into account as an aggravating factor, 

it was an error for the sentencing judge to fail to backdate the sentences beyond 17 April 2009 in that the applicant was being penalised for a second time in respect of the same matters. Reliance was place on R v Kaiva (NSWCCA, unreported 1998).

42It is clear from what was said on behalf of the applicant during the sentencing proceedings, and from the Parole Order and Parole Report, that the revocation of parole was due to breaches by the applicant of his parole conditions, i.e. failing to inform the Probation and Parole Service of his new address, failing to attend the Gateway Methadone Clinic to receive his methadone and failing to attend the Blacktown Mental Health Team to receive his anti-psychotic medication. The offences for which the applicant was sentenced by her Honour played no part in the revocation of his parole. Accordingly, it is incorrect to say that the applicant was being doubly penalised because the commission of these offences while the applicant was at conditional liberty was taken into account as an aggravating factor.

43It was open to her Honour to take account of the revocation of parole and to backdate the commencement of the sentence if she thought it was appropriate. She was not, however, bound to do so. Because parole was revoked for reasons other than the commission of the offences for which she was sentencing, her Honour determined not to take into account the time spent in custody by the applicant for breach of his parole conditions. This was a discretionary response open to her Honour: R v Kitchener [2003] NSWCCA 134. As that case makes clear at [51] - [52] the facts in R v Kaiva were most unusual and quite different to those in this case.

44In R v Callaghan [2006] NSWCCA 58; (2006) 160 A Crim R 145 Simpson J summarised the position as follows:

""21That the matter is discretionary appears to be the prevailing view of members of this Court. Even in Andrews and Kelly, the court accepted that a judge might backdate a sentence where parole had been revoked by reason of the offence for which the offender is then to be sentenced.

22I maintain the view that a discretion exists. There is no clear rule which will govern all cases. The circumstances that bring an offender before a court for sentence after parole has been revoked are far too varied to permit a single absolute rule.

23It would, in my opinion, in some cases be unfair not to backdate to some point (not necessarily the date of revocation of parole) before the expiration of the earlier parole period. It is always open to an offender to seek and be granted parole even after a revocation; to sentence in such a way as to commence the subsequent sentence only on the date of expiration of the whole of the previously imposed head sentence is to assume that, absent the subsequent offences, the offender would not have been granted a second chance at parole.""

45No error has been demonstrated in her Honour's approach to the commencement date of the sentences and this ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 3

46The applicant submitted that her Honour had not complied with s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in relation to the sentence for count 5 because the balance of the term of sentence exceeded one-third of the non-parole period and her Honour had not found special circumstances. Alternatively, the applicant submitted that there had been a failure to comply with s44 if one took into account as part of the sentence for these offences the period of time which the applicant had spent in custody for breach of parole.

47While the applicant's submission is correct if one looks at the sentence for count 5 in isolation, it fails when one considers the total effect of the sentence. The ratio between the total parole period and the total non-parole period is 1:3 which is precisely the ratio required by s44 if special circumstances have not been found. 

48For the reasons already articulated in relation to ground 2, there was no obligation for her Honour to take into account in fixing the non-parole period, the time spent by the applicant in custody as a result of his breach of parole for earlier and unrelated offences.

49The reasons given by her Honour for not finding special circumstances were appropriate. Her Honour took into account that on a number of prior occasions the applicant had been placed under supervision and had been given the opportunity for rehabilitation, but had not availed himself of those chances. As a result, her Honour saw no useful purpose being served by allowing for further supervision of the applicant upon his release to parole beyond that provided by s44.

50The wide discretion available to judges when deciding whether or not to make a finding of special circumstances was set out by RA Hulme J (with whom Giles JA and Adams J agreed) in R v Caristo [2011] NSWCCA 7:

""27The non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the offender must spend in custody having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the offence and the offender's subjective circumstances: Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 627-629; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [59]; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [34]. 

28A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact in respect of which this Court will be slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83].

29As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive - R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19]; R Cramp at [36].

30Simply because there are circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances, the Court is not required to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period R v Fidow at [22].

31The degree or extent of any adjustment of the ""statutory ratio"" is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Cramp at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56 at [33] ...""

51This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 4

52The applicant submitted that by reference to the statistics for offences against s112(1)(a) (i.e., break enter and steal after plea of guilty) the total sentence passed by her Honour was within the top 10 percent of sentences awarded for such offences and was therefore excessive. The applicant submitted that the large number of samples which went into making up the statistics gave added weight to the submission.

53By reference to four specific cases - R v Lay [2006] NSWCCA 45, Buddle v R [2006] NSWCCA 236, Arnold v R [2007] NSWCCA 188 and Chandler v R [2008] NSWCCA 240 - the applicant pointed out that significantly lower sentences had been imposed for much greater criminality than was involved here. By reference to those cases and the statistics generally, the applicant submitted that the total sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive.

54For the applicant to succeed on this ground, he must satisfy the Court that the sentences imposed by her Honour were unreasonable or plainly unjust (Makarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25, (2005) 202 CLR 357 at 370-371, Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13, (2009) 83 ALJR 579 at [8] - [9], R v Vuni [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33], Stewart, Wade John v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16] - [17], Simon Hayek v R [2010] NSWCCA 139 at [37]. It is not sufficient that this Court might be of the view that had it been sentencing the applicant, it might have exercised its discretion differently to that of the sentencing judge. Intervention is warranted only where error is demonstrated in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40, (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.

55Each case has to be considered on its own merits and no case is entirely similar to any other. There is a wide discretion to impose a sentence that seems to the judge to be just and appropriate. As was recently stated in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, when imposing a sentence the court has to take into account not only the objective seriousness of the offence, but all of the associated circumstances.

56The particular difficulty in relying upon statistics and sentences passed in other cases was identified by Garling J in Fogg v R [2011] NSWCCA 1:

""59... But for many offences, culpability varies over so wide a range that the statistics are of limited utility for a particular case: ...

60I accept that the statistics referred to demonstrate that the sentence in this case falls at the high end of the range of sentences imposed for the offence. But the question remains whether it falls within the range of the permissible exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion.""

57The limitations in the use of sentencing statistics have been emphasised by decisions at the highest level. In Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, (2010) 85 ALJR 195 the plurality said:

""54In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned.""

...

59As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen, ""[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion"". And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong, appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"". Rather, as the plurality went on to say[ in Wong, ""[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"". But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition. And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that ""the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error"".""

58What is important when considering a particular sentence are the specific findings as to the objective seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the offender. These are the considerations which are determinative when assessing whether a particular sentence is manifestly excessive rather than the comparison of sentences with statistics: Holloway v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 23 at [85]. The critical question is whether the sentence imposed was appropriate to the particular case: El Masri, Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 196 at [58].

59These were serious offences of their kind. Counts 2 and 5 involved the ransacking of the victims' homes and the stealing of large amounts of valuable property, including property of personal and sentimental value. The offences were committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty and against the background of his very lengthy criminal history for similar offences. Considerations of the protection of the community and deterrence (both general and personal) were of importance in the sentencing exercise. In relation to count 5 a number of additional serious offences were taken into account on a Form 1. The effect of this was to increase the sentence for that offence: Attorney General's Application under section 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146.

60Her Honour took those matters into account and error of the necessary kind has not been demonstrated in the sentence. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

61The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal should be granted but that the appeal should be dismissed.

62ROTHMAN J: I agree with Hoeben J.

2708741,R v Forbes [2011] NSWSC 1547,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HIS HONOUR: The offender Daniel James Forbes was indicted for the manslaughter of Joshua Maynard at Raymond Terrace on or about 29 June 2010.  The Crown accepted his plea to that charge on 8 June 2011.  He was originally charged with murder and taken into custody on 1 September 2010 where he remained until he was granted bail some 132 days later on 11 January 2011.  The murder charge was later withdrawn and replaced by the current charge.  The offender's plea to manslaughter, as the Crown properly concedes, was therefore entered at the first available opportunity.
The offence
2Except where specifically indicated, I make the following findings of fact, of which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.  They are taken from an agreed statement of facts tendered by the Crown on the sentencing proceedings.
3The deceased apparently belonged to a group known as ""the Raymond Terrace Boys"".  The offender belonged to a group known as ""the Lakeside Crew"".  On 29 June 2010 at about 9.00pm, members of both groups were involved in an altercation at the intersection of Salamander Place and Mount Hall Road, Raymond Terrace.  The deceased and the offender were both present and involved in what occurred at this time.  The offender was punched in the face and his friend Christopher Wilson sustained a facial injury and possibly concussion.  The offender and Christopher Wilson, together with other members of the Lakeside Crew, subsequently left the area and went to the offender's home.
4The offender telephoned John Shedden and told him what had happened.  A short time after that the offender and some of his companions gathered at Mr Shedden's home in Links Drive, Raymond Terrace.  Mr Shedden then made a series of telephone calls to a number of other people, requesting them to gather at his home.  One of those who came in response to that request was his brother, Chad Shedden. He brought with him a shortened firearm that he loaded in the presence of the offender.
5The offender, the Shedden brothers and at least seven others then left the Links Drive address and assembled in the street nearby.  Chad Shedden was armed with the shortened firearm.  Others were armed with poles, rods, pieces of masonry and brick, and a tomahawk.
6At some time between 11.30pm on 29 June 2010 and 12.10am on 30 June 2010, the deceased and three other men were travelling along Links Drive in a blue Holden Commodore.  The deceased was seated in the rear on the passenger's side.  The group that included the offender and the Shedden brothers stopped the vehicle.  They then proceeded to attack the car with projectiles and other weapons.  The car was damaged and the rear window was smashed.
7At some stage the deceased alighted from the vehicle, possibly armed with a knife or a sword.  There is a factual issue about whether or not the deceased was in fact armed.  However, having regard to the evidence (referred to below) given to police about this by the offender, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was armed with a knife.  When the deceased moved slightly away from the door of the car, Chad Shedden discharged the firearm, shooting the deceased in the chest at close range.  He died from wounds he received before reaching hospital.  The offender and the others then ran back to the Links Drive address.  John Shedden took possession of the firearm and later disposed of it.
8John Shedden provided a statement to the police on 2 July 2010 in which he denied any involvement in these events.  
9The offender provided a statement to the police on the same day.  Some of the particular matters revealed by the offender at that time included the following.  He said that he had consumed about twenty alcoholic drinks on 29 June 2010 between 10.30am and 7.50pm.  At about that time he was walking along Mount Hall Road with other members of the Lakeside Crew when they saw a red or maroon coloured Holden Commodore.  Christopher Wilson approached the car and was attacked by a man who alighted from it.  He was kneed and punched in the face.  The offender was also punched in the course of this incident.  
10He confirmed other details of the events described earlier.  For example, he told police that when he was preparing to go to John Shedden's house, he initially took a decorative sword from his room.  However, he ultimately left that item behind and so did not take it with him when he went to Links Drive.   The offender recalled that there were weapons at John Shedden's house but could not remember who had them.
11The offender also told police that John Shedden made a number of telephone calls asking people to ""come around"".  The offender said that there was ""never"" any discussion about what was going to happen, apart from some of the group saying, ""Don't worry Chris, we'll get them back"".  About one hour after John Shedden made his telephone calls, Chad Shedden and other ""mates"" of John Shedden arrived at the premises.  Chad Shedden pulled the gun from his right sleeve.  The offender described the weapon as having some ""wood"" on it.   Whilst seated in the lounge room of the premises, Chad Shedden put a cartridge into the barrel of the gun and took it out a number of times.
12The group then left the house and went to Mount Hall Road where they heard some cars driving near Salamander Place.  He said that he did not remember any particular discussion amongst the group as they walked from John Shedden's house but he thought that they ""would be doing something to get back at the blokes who bashed [them]"". The group sat down in a reserve at the end of Salamander Place for about ten minutes.  The group then walked back towards John Shedden's house.  During the walk the offender saw two cars drive along Mount Hall Road, one being the Holden Commodore and the other being a white car that had been present when Christopher Wilson was assaulted.  The Holden Commodore did a u-turn and drove back along Mount Hall Road and stopped near the group.  The offender heard one of the occupants of the car yelling out, ""Who wants to get stabbed?""  Three or four men then got out of the car.  One of them was the deceased.
13The offender recognised the deceased as the person who had assaulted Christopher Wilson earlier in the evening.  He said that he had a knife in his right hand about 30cm to 40cm in length with a ""curved edge"".  The offender told the police that another man from the vehicle was also armed with a knife.  The offender said that he ""backed up"" down Links Drive after seeing the men with knives.  John Shedden was a couple of metres in front of him when he heard Chad Shedden call out, ""John, watch out"".  He then heard a loud bang and realised it was the gun firing.  He saw the deceased hit by a gunshot and stumble back into the car, which then drove off.  The offender told the police that he did not see who fired the gun but that John Shedden was not holding it.  The only person he ever saw with a gun was Chad Shedden.
Crime scene evidence
14Police examined the vehicle in which the deceased was travelling immediately prior to the offence.  There were numerous linear depressions located on both sides of the bonnet.  The passenger side rear vision mirror was missing, together with the base of the mirror housing.  A large linear depression was to be seen on the driver's side of the boot lid about 23cm in length.  The metal in the immediate vicinity was dented and was apparently caused by the same force that caused the linear depression.  Scrape marks were also evident.
15The police recovered a number of items from the area in Links Drive.  These included a black handled serrated knife, four separate fragments of brick or paver, a piece of metal grille, a piece of grey metal and a brown handled hammer.  Police also recovered a metal star picket and a cutlery knife from a house in Salamander Place.
Basis of plea of guilty to manslaughter
16It is clear from the facts that I have found that the offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he participated in a joint criminal enterprise to carry out acts that were both unlawful and dangerous.  Having been subject to an attack by the deceased and others, the offender gathered people together to assist him to respond by assaulting the deceased and his companions with a view to causing them actual bodily harm.  Counsel for the offender conceded that a reasonable person in the position of the offender would have contemplated that the assault and the unlawful violence carried with them an appreciable risk of serious injury to the deceased and his companions, particularly since some of the offender's colleagues were armed with items such as pavers, poles and a tomahawk, and Chad Shedden had a loaded shotgun.
17In the course of carrying out the agreement to assault and cause actual bodily harm to the deceased and others, and while the offender was still a party to this agreement, Chad Shedden discharged the weapon he was carrying thereby causing the death of the deceased.  The offender participated in the joint criminal enterprise by helping to arrange for the parties to gather at the Links Drive address in order to go together, intending to assault and cause actual bodily harm to the deceased and others.  In addition he was present at the time of the fatal discharge of the weapon and so was involved in an assault upon the deceased and the others with knowledge that actual bodily harm was intended to be caused to them: see R v Chai [2000] NSWCCA 320.
18In this case the unlawful act contemplated was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon the deceased and his companions.  The act contemplated was dangerous because in all the circumstances of this case a reasonable person in the offender's position would have appreciated that the contemplated act was one which exposed others to the risk of serious injury: see Wilson v The Queen [1992] HCA 31; (1992) 174 CLR 313.  See also Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64; (2003) 219 CLR 1 at [10]-[26] and R v AB [2005] NSWCCA 360; (2005) 156 A Crim R 577 at [107] and [108], in which this Court discussed the concept that an accused person can be guilty of manslaughter where he knows of the presence of a firearm, whether or not he contemplates that it might be discharged.  
Sentencing for manslaughter
19In R v Nguyen [2005] NSWSC 600 at [21]-[24], Johnson J set out the relevant sentencing principles in the case of the crime of manslaughter.  In setting out the paragraphs referred to, I respectfully adopt his Honour's summary:
""[21] The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: s.24 Crimes Act 1900. The offence of manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life, and as such it has long been recognised as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. In R v MacDonald (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, BC9501664), the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Hunt CJ at CL) said at page 8: 
'Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. This may involve a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. (See R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.) The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectations of that system.'
[22] In R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, BC9501665), Gleeson CJ (Grove and Ireland JJ agreeing) said at page 4: 
'It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.'
[23] The importance of denunciation in sentencing for manslaughter has been stressed: R v MacDonald, above, at page 9. Little assistance is to be gained by reference to sentencing statistics which encompass all forms of manslaughter, save so far as they disclose a broad range within which sentences have been passed since their compilation began: R v Mohamad Ali [2005] NSWSC 334 at paragraph 61. 
[24] A sentence for manslaughter must reflect the seriousness of unlawfully taking the life of another human being and it is not of great moment whether the killing is characterised as coming within any particular head of manslaughter. Rather, it is a question of what sentence is required to reflect the objective facts by way of retribution and denunciation, the subjective circumstances and, if necessary, deterrence: R v Walsh (2004) 142 A Crim R 140 at 149 (paragraph 40); R v Mohamad Ali, above, at paragraph 56.""
20I have had regard to these comments in the course of my deliberations in this matter.
Subjective features
21The offender was born in February 1992 and is the only child of the union of his biological parents.  He has a younger maternal half-sister.  He was born in Queensland but his family relocated to Raymond Terrace when he was four years old.  His parents separated shortly thereafter and he remained in the custody of his mother.  He had a normal childhood and a close relationship with his mother.  She was ""strict"".
22The offender's mother had approximately three casual partners whom he appears to have liked but with whom he did not form a paternal relationship.  He maintains a close and supportive relationship with his half-sister.  Following his parents' separation, the offender maintained only sporadic contact with his father until he was in Year 6 but that contact became further restricted when his father was sentenced to a period in custody.  He has had very little contact with his father since the age of about 15.
23The offender enjoyed school despite the fact that he was not particularly studious.  He attended two primary schools without problems of any sort.  He also attended two high schools.  He was not disciplined for behavioural problems and was a quiet student.  He was not suspended or expelled and did not fail to attend.  He had good relationships with his teachers and fellow students and was not bullied.  He played sport and received merit certificates for good behaviour.  The offender ceased school before the completion of Year 10 to seek employment.  He later completed a literacy and numeracy course through TAFE.
24The offender thereafter obtained employment as a concrete labourer at the age of 15.  He remained in that employment for a few months when he resigned to seek more remunerative work.  Between the ages of 15 and 18 he worked intermittently as a lighting and sound technician at concerts.  He resigned from this work when he was relocated with his family to another area in circumstances referred to later in these remarks.
25The offender has no prior criminal history of any sort.  I was provided with a large series of testimonials from people in many different walks of life.  All spoke with one voice about the offender's kind nature and courteous disposition.  A reoccurring theme of surprise was also evident.  A former employer confirmed that he would re-employ the offender without hesitation.  He is described by the Team Leader of Port Stephens Youth Services as having been ""a real leader amongst his peer group"" for close on two years and ""a very confident, committed and genuinely...caring young person"".  He was responsible for helping to get a PCYC Outreach basketball program running in Irrawang.
26I find that the offender is a person of good character and is entitled to be given the benefit upon sentence of such favourable consideration as that finding may permit.
Psychologist's report
27Danielle Hopkins, a psychologist, assessed the offender on 24 October 2011 at the request of his solicitor.  Part of her report recites a history given to her by the offender with respect to the offence.  It is in the following terms:
""Mr Forbes has pleaded guilty to the current charge and is awaiting sentencing.  In discussing the criminal behaviour, he noted events that are generally consistent with the Agreed Facts.  He discussed antecedents to the offence as that it was a friend's 18th birthday.  He said that it was a social event, he had consumed two 'six packs' of beer (approximately 18 standard drinks) throughout the day and was intoxicated.  He noted that as the group walked home in the evening, they were accosted by a group of people and Mr Forbes was punched in the eye.  He advised that some of the other members of the group were also assaulted and they all returned to one of their houses.  He noted that they hatched a plan to retaliate against the group that had assaulted them earlier in the evening.  Mr Forbes explained that at this time, he was aware of one of his co-offender[s] having possession of a firearm but said that he 'was not comprehending what would really happen' and believed it to be 'just big talk', explaining that he did not anticipate his co-offender to use the firearm.  When Mr Forbes and his co-offenders confronted the other group of men including the victim, he said that he had seen men running in the other direction to his co-offender and began running with them.  He noted that he had already begun to flee the scene when he heard the gun shot and continued to abscond.""
28Ms Hopkins reported that the offender expressed what she considered to be genuine remorse and regret for his offending behaviour.  He told her that he believed the offence ""shouldn't have happened"".   He was only young.  He told her that his own parents would be just as upset as the parents of the deceased.  He said that he ""regrets that it happened but can't take those kinds of things back"" despite his desire to do so.
29The offender reported that he had not been involved with mental health professionals.  He has never been prescribed psychotropic medication or been diagnosed with a mental illness.  He denied any serious anxiety or psychotic symptoms.  He also denied any periods throughout his life when he had been concerned about his mental health.
30The offender also noted that his mood was ""good, normal"" and stable.  He did not present with difficulties such as appetite changes, low mood, concentration difficulties, energy problems or suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm.  He did not present with consistent symptoms of depression or adjustment disorder.  Ms Hopkins opined that the offender was not mentally impaired and was functioning well.  He advised her that the seriousness of the offence had ""not sunk in yet"", but he believed that it may become ""real"" when he is sentenced.
31Ms Hopkins expressed the following opinion with respect to the offender's risk of re-offending:
""In sum, taking into account the historical, clinical and future risk factors, Mr Forbes is considered to pose a low risk of reoffence within the violent domain.  [The fact] that the offending behaviour occurred when he was young and the fact that he has experienced a somewhat unstable employment history are his only risk factors.  Positively, he is motivated to engage with intervention.  Future risk factors such as exposure to destabilisers, including deviant peers and employment problems.""
32Ms Hopkins concluded her report with the following recommendations:
""When Mr Forbes returns to the community he may benefit from some support in order to monitor his adjustment back into society...Assistance with employment would be beneficial for his community stability and he may contact specialist employment services that focus on these types of barriers to employment"".
33No contrary submissions were made.
Aggravating and mitigating factors
34Counsel for the offender provided me with written submissions in which he contended that even though an offence that involves the death of a human being is ""one of the gravest offences against an ordered society"" (R v Bolt [2001] NSWCCA 487; (2001) 126 A Crim R 284), this was a case in which the death of the deceased was not something that the offender desired, contemplated, anticipated, expected or intended.  Notwithstanding that submission, counsel for the offender also conceded that the seriousness of the offence in this case was such that the sentence to be imposed could not be anything other than one of full time imprisonment.
35In this context I note that the offence was aggravated by reason of the use of a weapon, even though the offender was not armed with it, or indeed armed with any weapon at all.  The offence was committed in company.  The shooting that caused the death of the deceased was also committed without regard for public safety, even though the discharge of the weapon was not an outcome intended by the offender.  The offence as such involved no specific planning at all, but the circumstances which led to its commission were associated with limited planning, including the gathering of the group in order to pursue members of another group of young men who had assaulted one of their number earlier in the evening.  These are matters that I find are aggravating factors.
36In terms of mitigating factors it is apparent that the death of the deceased was not itself planned, organised or even discussed.  There was some provocation, in terms of the assaults upon the offender and Christopher Wilson, although in the scheme of things these acts were low on the scale of events that might be expected to provoke any response at all and certainly not one that corresponded to the result that eventuated.  I do not consider that the provocation was significant.  As discussed elsewhere, the offender has no criminal convictions and I regard him to be a person of prior good character.  I accept as well that he is very unlikely to re-offend and clearly has excellent prospects for rehabilitation.  This is particularly so having regard to his absence of any criminal record, his young age and his family support.
37The offender's only expression of remorse was to be found in the terms of Ms Hopkins' report.  This is somewhat unsatisfactory.  However, no submission was made suggesting that I should disregard it or give it less weight for that reason.  It was agreed and accepted that the offender's plea of guilty was offered at the earliest opportunity with all of the attendant advantages and benefits that accompany that fact.  That early plea is also itself some evidence of remorse and contrition.
38Further, the offender gave a witness statement and took part in a recorded interview in the course of which he set out in detail his role in the offence and provided details of the actions of others, including in particular John Shedden and Chad Shedden.  These amount to mitigating circumstances as well.
The plea of guilty and assistance to authorities
39An undertaking by the offender to give evidence on behalf of the Crown has been tendered in evidence before me.  It is intended that the Crown will call the offender to give evidence in accordance with a statement given by him on 2 July 2010 and a record of interview conducted on 1 September 2010 detailing in each case what he said was the involvement of himself and others who have been charged with murder arising out of the incident in which the deceased was killed.  The offender has expressed fears about each of the co-accused against whom he will be required to give evidence.  The Crown accepts that these fears have a basis in fact.
40In R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151, Howie J had this to say concerning assistance to authorities:
""[3] As Latham J points out, the discount for assistance reflects a number of considerations that impact upon the sentence to be imposed upon the offender. One factor has traditionally been that a person giving assistance will normally be at risk within the gaol environment and, therefore, may need protection for a substantial part, if not all, of the term of the sentence. When this Court has expressed the view that the appropriate range for the plea of guilty and assistance is between 20 and 50 per cent, that range has been formulated on the basis that some reduction was due, not only to encourage others to give information to the authorities but also 'to compensate them for the more difficult conditions under which they will inevitably have to serve their sentences as a result of having given that information', see R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 250. 
[4] However, it is no longer inevitable that an offender who has provided assistance will serve the sentence in more difficult conditions. As was pointed out in R v Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304 the experience of this Court at least has been that prisoners who have provided assistance are not serving their sentences, or even a significant part of their sentences, in any more onerous conditions than prisoners in the general prison population. In Mostyn the appellant's discount was reduced when the Court came to re-sentence him because of evidence placed before this Court that indicated that he was not serving his sentence in more difficult circumstances nor was he deprived of programmes to aid in his rehabilitation. 
[5] It seems to me that the courts should now acknowledge the reality of the situation and reduce the range of discount to reflect the fact that one of the bases of the discount is no longer generally applicable. In my opinion discounts for a plea and assistance of more than 40 per cent should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted in a case where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population. It should now be accepted that an offender who has provided assistance will not necessarily be disadvantaged in the prison system and, if the offender wishes to assert otherwise, he or she should lead evidence of that fact. 
[6] In the present case there was simply no evidence that the respondent was at risk by reason of the assistance he had given or that the assistance would have impacted at all upon the manner in which he would be required to serve his sentence. There was no evidence placed before this Court in answer to the Crown appeal to show that in any way the respondent had been disadvantaged by the fact that he had given assistance. The Judge erred in the discount given to the respondent for his plea and assistance and one of the reasons is because he made the unjustified assumption that imprisonment would be more onerous for the respondent because of the assistance provided.""
41The Crown called Det Sgt Olivares, a police officer with over 23 years' experience in the NSW Police Service.  He was the officer in charge of the investigation into the offences arising out of the circumstances already described.  He was asked some questions concerning the offender and what he anticipated would be the consequences for and effects upon the offender were he to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  Det Olivares said that he was aware that the offender ""had had no contact with the criminal justice system whatsoever"" and that that ""placed him in a position of being rather vulnerable"".  He gave the following evidence as well:
""Q.  And is there some - what can you tell me about how people who are totally naïve to the criminal justice system, about Mr Forbes' age, if they are faced with or confronted with the reality of a prison sentence?
A.  Well from my experience, and I can only speak from my experience, is that Mr Forbes is going to find it rather difficult, should he receive a custodial sentence.  The problem he has is that he is very vulnerable.  He's young and he has no experience or worldly experience in relation to dealing with what you'd call hardened adults, which is what he's likely to face should he be sentenced to a custodial sentence.""
42Det Olivares also gave evidence that, by reason of either some actual acts of intimidation against the offender, including the fact that his car had been firebombed, or at least the threat of recrimination against him for agreeing to give evidence against his co-accused, in particular the Shedden brothers, he had been relocated outside the Raymond Terrace area with his family for his protection.  Det Olivares confirmed that it was clear from this that the offender could anticipate that any time that he spent in custody would be particularly difficult and onerous for him and would have to be served in protection.  I accept that the offender will be at risk of physical harm and reprisals during any period of incarceration that he may serve and even following his release.
43It was in these circumstances uncontroversial before me that the offender was entitled to a substantial discount for the combined effect of his early plea of guilty and his undertaking to give evidence against his co-accused.  It was recognised and accepted in this context as well that the case against the Shedden brothers would be materially and significantly assisted by the particular evidence that the offender would be able to give.  I accept the Crown's submission that the offender's case ""does [not] get into the exceptional category of above 50 per cent"".  However, having regard to the particular circumstances of this case, and to the terms of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I consider that a discount of 50 per cent for the combined effect of his early plea of guilty and his undertaking to give evidence against his co-accused is appropriate.
Contrition and remorse
44The offender did not give evidence before me.  Any proper understanding of his attitude to his offending and its consequences for others is therefore principally to be gleaned from what he reported to Ms Hopkins.  However, I accept that assistance to authorities may provide some evidence of remorse and contrition: R v Sukkar. 
Special circumstances
45It was contended on behalf of the offender that special circumstances existed in the fact that a custodial sentence would see him in prison for the first time in circumstances where the strong likelihood, approaching certainty, would be that he would serve his sentence in protective custody by reason of his undertaking to give evidence against his co-accused: see, for example, R v Stelfox [2001] NSWSC 630 at [34].
46I am prepared to find special circumstances to justify a reduction in the non-parole period that would otherwise result from an application of the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The Crown did not argue against such a contention.  I consider that special circumstances exist for the reasons suggested, as well as for the reason that the offender is likely to confront some difficulties obtaining employment having regard to his age, limited qualifications and experience.  I note that this was one of the matters to which Ms Hopkins made particular reference. 
Determination of sentence
47There is no standard non-parole period for the offence of manslaughter.  Moreover, the range of possible factual circumstances that may fall for consideration as manslaughter is extremely wide. 
48The extent to which the offender himself intended to inflict harm of any sort on members of the opposing group emerges from his ERISP.  He said that as his group was leaving the house, his intention was to ""punch on"" with the members of the opposing group.  He explained that this was because of all of the alcohol he had consumed and because he was angry at the time at what had happened to Christopher Wilson.  He agreed that he wanted to ""get them back"".    In answer to another question about what his intention was at that stage, he said it was ""whatever the group's thinking"".  He said that he was just following the others.  In response to another question about whether he had ""the intention of punching on with these blokes...if he found them"", the offender responded, ""Oh maybe, if I probably found them, yeah"".  He reiterated later that he only wanted a fight, saying, ""I didn't want to bring weapons or none of that"". 
49It is apparent that the offender neither armed himself with any weapon nor would he appear at any time up until when the deceased was killed to have taken any specific or particular act in furtherance of the enterprise beyond his limited organisation of his colleagues and his presence at the scene as a participant in it.  However, the offender was aware that other members of the group had armed themselves with weapons and that one member of his group had armed himself with a shortened firearm.  It is also clear that, by reason of what he saw at the Links Drive premises, he knew or might reasonably have inferred that the firearm was loaded.
50Significantly for present purposes, the Crown accepts that the shooting of the deceased was not intended by the offender as part of any attack upon the deceased or his group.  Moreover, the Crown accepts that the offender did not contemplate as a possibility that the shooting would occur. These concessions accord with the facts as I find them, and mean that the offender's conduct must be assessed as falling at a significantly reduced level of criminality in the circumstances.
51It is trite to observe that the death of the deceased is a tragic and unfortunate event.  The death of any member of the community as the result of unnecessary and unacceptable criminal violence will always be a very serious matter and something deserving of the sternest condemnation.  In terms of assessing the objective seriousness of the offence to which the offender has pleaded guilty, however, it is also important to bear in mind that it is his particular role in the events concerned that are called up for examination.
52The Crown has emphasised that the attack, during which the deceased was killed, was a planned and organised act.  The attack was in retaliation for an earlier assault.  As I have already intimated, however, the level of planning involved was in my view quite low.  Certainly from the offender's standpoint, there would appear to be no more than an ill-considered and vague proposal to wander the streets of Raymond Terrace in the hope that his group might encounter its rivals.  The so-called plan was at no stage one that rose above the prospect that the two groups would find one another and that a fight might occur.  I accept that some members of the group took crude weapons with them but that the offender did not.
53The Crown has also contended that what was involved was mob violence in a suburban residential area amounting to riot.  It involved trespassing on private property at a time when residents would be expected to be in their homes.  Even putting aside the presence of the firearm, the Crown contended that the conduct being engaged in carried a high risk of very serious consequences.  The presence of the loaded firearm exacerbated this situation.
54The Crown submitted, having regard to the infinite scale of facts that could amount to the offence of manslaughter, that the subject offence falls towards the middle of the range of seriousness, and well above circumstances normally, or at least most often, encountered in manslaughters committed by an unlawful and dangerous act.
55In R v Stelfox, the facts of which bear some broad resemblance to the facts in the present case, Howie J said this at [29]:
""[29] This appears to me to be simply a case where the prisoner, while being somewhat affected by alcohol and drugs, and perhaps being, as he described it, at the wrong place at the wrong time, chose to participate in serious criminal conduct because one or more of his close friends were involved. Unfortunately, this is not an unusual scenario for young men in our community...""
56In that case his Honour came to the conclusion that the offender's role in the enterprise which resulted in the death of the deceased ""was substantial"" and that it was ""a serious case of manslaughter"": at [17].  I agree with that assessment by his Honour.  However, I consider that the present case is far removed from the seriousness of the offence committed in that case.
57I reaffirm my concern that any case of manslaughter must necessarily be viewed as serious to the extent that it results in the death of an innocent person.  In the present case the offender was in all relevant and practical respects an unworldly young man with an unblemished record whose involvement in the unfolding events of the fateful evening has contributed to an unanticipated and tragic outcome.  Whilst in no way condoning the unacceptable behaviour revealed by the offender's own admission of what was intended on the night, the ""plan"" did not involve or anticipate that there would be any more than a proportionate response in retaliation for the earlier attack upon his group.  The offender intended to ""punch on"", but things went terribly wrong.  This is a case, in conformity with the submissions made on behalf of the offender, in which he truly was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
58There is as well the very troubling spectre of the role played in all of these events by the Shedden brothers.  Each has a significant criminal history, as the evidence tendered before me reveals.  Chad Shedden has spent time in custody, including convictions and sentences for violence and drug related offences.  John Shedden has been convicted of armed robbery and assault and has served terms of imprisonment.  Neither has a conviction for offences involving the use or possession of firearms.  Each was also in relative terms considerably older than the offender and other members of the Lakeside Crew.  It is clear that they were influential in what occurred. Moreover, in terms of the influences that may have been at play or in some way exerted upon the offender in particular, I observe that Det Olivares gave evidence that Chad Shedden had at one time been in an intimate relationship with the offender's mother.   The presence of the Shedden brothers at the events of the evening and their participation in them in my view added a malevolent dimension that the offender at least did not foresee or appreciate and certainly did not comprehend.
59In dealing with the various layers of criminal responsibility, this Court should be slow to characterise as identical or even similar those events that on closer examination are revealed to have significant differences.  I have in mind, for example, the differences between the involvement of the offender in the death of the deceased in cases like R v Stelfox and the corresponding but different role of the current offender.  Each pleaded guilty and was convicted of the same offence but the dissimilarities in my view produce a significantly different sentencing outcome.  The relationship between the death of the deceased and the presence of the offender at the scene in this case is very little more than spatial and contemporaneous.  He did not contribute to the death of the deceased in any direct causal sense and he had no opportunity to prevent it or to withdraw from the enterprise on the theoretical assumption that he had been apprised of what was about to occur.  The objective seriousness of the criminal acts to which this offender has pleaded guilty are in my view at the lower end of the scale of criminality for this offence.
60It strikes me as uncontroversial that at the time of the events that give rise to these proceedings, the offender was inexperienced in life and unfamiliar with the potential consequences of violence.  He was also naïve and gullible, and upon the basis of his uncontested record of interview, he was easily led.  I recognise and accept that part of the sentencing exercise is to punish and generally to deter others from committing like offences.  That exercise necessarily requires a proper balance to be struck between the consequences flowing from the commission of an offence concerned with the death of an innocent person and the need to give meaningful recognition of the subjective characteristics of the particular offender.
61I have not been provided with a victim impact statement.  That is not to suggest that the death of the deceased has not had a terrible and enduring impact upon the close relatives and friends of the deceased.  Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of those who remember him.
62Taking into account all of the objective facts and all of the subjective circumstances, and other factors required to be taken into account under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I consider that the appropriate sentence in this case is one of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months.  The commencement of that sentence should be backdated to 6 August 2011 to take account of the period already served before bail was granted.  I order that the sentence I impose will operate from that date.  The sentence as proposed also takes into account my finding of special circumstances and the combined discount for the early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities.
63I also wish to record in the strongest and most emphatic terms that for the reasons and in the circumstances highlighted in the course of these remarks, the offender is known to be potentially very vulnerable and liable to extra curial punishments within the prison system unless special and urgent steps are taken to prevent this occurring.  I will direct that a copy of these remarks be taken out and forwarded as a matter of urgency to Commissioner Woodham at Corrective Services NSW, in the expectation that my concerns are addressed and proper protective protocols are instituted and followed.
64Daniel James Forbes, for the manslaughter of Joshua Maynard, to which you have pleaded guilty, I sentence you to imprisonment for 3 years, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 6 August 2011 and expiring on 5 February 2013, and to a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 6 February 2013 and expiring on 5 August 2014.  I direct that the offender be released on parole on 5 February 2013. I direct that as a condition of the offender's parole he be required to submit to the supervision and direction of the Probation and Parole Service during the period of parole that I have specified.

		27 August 2012",2011-12-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708742,Damon JOB v R [2011] NSWCCA 267,"Judgment 

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 

2Hidden J: The applicant, Damon Job, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a number of offences of a fraudulent nature arising from his employment at the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA). He was sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating 5 years with an effective non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 19 August 2010, when he was remanded in custody at the conclusion of the proceedings on sentence. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 

Facts 

3The applicant joined the RTA in 1998. In late 2003, he was appointed to the position of Operations Manager within the Traffic Management Centre. His duties included responsibility for ""tidal flow"" operations, which are the traffic arrangements designed to give extra lanes of traffic travelling in a particular direction during peak hour periods. He received training in anti-corruption, the RTA's Code of Conduct and the importance of declaring any conflict of interest which might arise. 

4However, he used his position corruptly to benefit a friend of his parents, Terry Steptoe. He himself received benefits from this pattern of corruption, which occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 March 2006. Over that period Mr Steptoe received about $300,000, of which the applicant was paid $106,500 as a reward for his corrupt activities. 

5There is no need to describe the offences in any detail. Mr Steptoe operated a company named Advanced Traffic Solutions which, apparently, provided services necessary for the RTA's tidal flow activities. Late in 2003, the RTA called for tenders for work at Mays Hill. The applicant knew that Mr Steptoe was in financial difficulty and suggested that he put in a tender. Eventually, the RTA awarded his company the work and a contract was entered into. 

6Put shortly, after that contract expired Mr Steptoe's company continued to provide invoices to the RTA for work which was not done. This occurred on seven occasions, and on each occasion the applicant certified that work had been completed satisfactorily and that the invoice should be paid. This fraudulent activity took place in the second half of 2005, the amount involved being $93,632. The applicant was rewarded by receiving payments from Mr Steptoe. 

7This gave rise to seven charges of obtaining a benefit by deception, pursuant to s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, and a charge of corruptly receiving a benefit, pursuant to s 249B(1) of the Act. The former charge carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 5 years, and the latter a maximum of imprisonment for 7 years. 

8Between late 2004 and early 2006, the applicant contracted tidal flow work at Lane Cove to Mr Steptoe's company without attending to any of the processes required by the RTA. For this he again received a benefit, which was the subject of a further charge under s 249B of the Crimes Act . 

9Over the period between late 2003 and May 2005, Mr Steptoe's company invoiced the RTA for the supply of ""candy bars"", which are the striped plastic metal tubes placed in sockets in the road for the purpose of tidal flow operations. The invoices totalled a little over $93,400. The applicant approved them for payment despite the fact that no such candy bars had ever been supplied. The benefit he received from this also led to a charge under s 249B. 

10The final set of charges related to Rail Corp ""shutdowns"". This expression refers to the situation where train services are suspended while maintenance work is carried out and buses are provided for the passengers who would otherwise have travelled by train. This process requires additional services, such as the creation of special event clearways. For that purpose, Rail Corp must co-ordinate the shutdowns with the RTA. 

11The applicant and Mr Steptoe's company were also involved in this activity. Put shortly, the fraudulent conduct was this. The proper procedure was that the State Rail Authority should have paid Mr Steptoe for the work the company did. The RTA should then have invoiced Mr Steptoe, and Mr Steptoe should have paid the RTA for the work relating to the shutdowns. The applicant should have made arrangements for the RTA to have invoiced Mr Steptoe, but he did not. The result was that the RTA itself carried out work in relation to the special event clearways, but the State Rail Authority paid Mr Steptoe for that work. The payments, over the period between January 2004 and February 2006, amounted to a little over $197,700. This led to four further charges under s 178B(1) of the Crimes Act , and a further charge under s 249B(1) for the benefit which the applicant received. 

12Mr Steptoe was also charged, and at the time the applicant was sentenced he was awaiting trial in the District Court. As will be seen, the applicant undertook to give evidence against him. Subsequently, however, Mr Steptoe pleaded guilty. 

13The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had performed ""many separate acts of criminality"", for which he was paid, over a substantial period. Mr Steptoe was the major beneficiary of these offences, but the applicant also profited from them. They were committed out of greed, not need, and constituted a breach of the trust placed in the applicant as a public servant. 

14His Honour also noted that there was significant overlap between the offences under s 178BA and s 249B, which he recognised in the structure of the sentences which he passed. For each of the seven charges under s 178BA relating to the Mays Hill tidal flow activities, he sentenced the applicant to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for 18 months, to commence on 19 August 2010. For each of the four charges under s 178BA relating to the Rail Corp shutdowns, he also imposed concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for 18 months but directed them to commence on 19 August 2011. Finally, for the four charges under s 249B, he imposed concurrent terms of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year, to commence on 19 August 2012. Thus, as I have said, the overall sentence was imprisonment for 5 years with an effective non-parole period of 3 years. 

Subjective case 

15The applicant is now 42 years old. He has no criminal history of any significance. He is married with two children. He had a difficult childhood, having been brought up in an environment of financial disadvantage and having been the victim of sexual assault between the ages of 6 and 9. Although he was clever, he did not pursue a university education. He joined the police force, where his work was primarily concerned with traffic management. It was against that background that he secured his position with the RTA. 

16He gave evidence in the sentence proceedings, and the trial judge found him to be completely frank about the offences and to be genuinely remorseful. Moreover, he had assisted the authorities by making a statement to ICAC investigators and had undertaken to give evidence against Mr Steptoe. His Honour considered that that evidence would be ""particularly valuable."" He had entered early pleas of guilty, and his Honour recognised those pleas and his assistance to the authorities by a discount of sentence of 40%. His Honour found that he was unlikely to commit offences of this kind in the future. 

17The applicant was suffering from mental illness when he committed the offences. He also gave evidence that he intended to repay the money which he corruptly received. These two matters are the subject of grounds of the application, and I shall consider that material, and his Honour's approach to it, when dealing with those grounds. 

The application 

18Eight grounds of the application were filed, but at the hearing the fourth of them was abandoned. 

Grounds 1, 2 and 3 - sentence discount 

19The first three grounds can be dealt with together. They relate to his Honour's combined discount for the applicant's pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities. It was submitted that, in arriving at that discount, his Honour had conflated the applicant's remorse with his pleas of guilty and his assistance. It was also submitted that the discount failed adequately to reflect the value of the assistance offered. 

20The argument that the discount was intended to embrace the applicant's remorse as well as his pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities derived from a passage in the remarks on sentence. After finding that in his evidence the applicant had not attempted in any way to minimise the extent of his wrongdoing, his Honour said: 

""I am satisfied that the offender is remorseful for what he has done, not only because he will suffer and not only because his family will suffer too, but because he now recognises the significant impact that his wrong doing has had upon public perceptions of bodies such as the RTA. 

... 

That attitude can seen not only in what the offender said but in what he has promised to do. His co-offender, Mr Steptoe, is due to stand trial later this year. The offender has undertaken to assist the authorities by giving evidence against Mr Steptoe. That evidence will be particularly valuable and so I will impose upon the offender a sentence which is forty per cent less than it would have been in the absence of such assistance and his early pleas of guilty."" 

21There is clear authority that remorse should not itself be the subject of a quantified discount of sentence, nor should it be a component of such a discount: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102, 195 A Crim R 1, at [32]. Counsel for the applicant, Ms Nash, submitted that the quoted passage from the remarks demonstrates that his Honour made the applicant's remorse a component of the discount he expressed. 

22I do not read the passage in that way. From the last sentence quoted it is clear enough that his Honour was confining the discount to the applicant's pleas of guilty and his assistance. Indeed, immediately after the quoted passage his Honour continued: 

""The offender is entitled to rely significantly upon his demonstrated remorse, his assistance, the unlikelihood that he will commit offences of this nature in the future as well as the circumstance that his depression reduced his ability to reason about the wrongfulness of his misconduct."" 

23While his Honour referred to the applicant's assistance in that sentence, it is clear that his remorse was being taken into account, along with his good prospects of rehabilitation and his depressive condition, as a favourable factor in his subjective case, but not as a component of the quantified discount. That his Honour referred to assistance in that passage conveys no more than his recognition of the inevitable overlap between remorse and assistance to the authorities: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220, at 228. 

24As to the adequacy of the discount insofar as it was intended to reflect the applicant's assistance, Ms Nash noted his Honour's observation that his evidence against Mr Steptoe would be particularly valuable. In oral argument, she said that it might be inferred that that evidence was material to Mr Steptoe's decision to plead guilty. His Honour saw a risk that the applicant may have to serve some of his sentence on protection, ""he being a former police officer and a person who will be giving evidence for the prosecution."" He emphasised, however, that he was speaking only of a risk, and that it was impossible to say whether it would be necessary for any part of a sentence to be served in that way and, if so, whether it would involve conditions of custody more difficult that those faced by the general prison population. 

25Ms Nash referred to R v M [2005] NSWCCA 224, also a sentence appeal in which the adequacy of a combined discount of 40% for plea of guilty and assistance was challenged. Buddin J, with whom James and Rothman JJ agreed, referred at [21] to R v Pang (1998) 105 A Crim R 474, in which Wood CJ at CL noted that the discount ""customarily given in this State for assistance"" has ranged between 20% and 50%. Buddin J added that it was not clear whether that range took into account ""the interplay between a plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities."" 

26Buddin J concluded that, in the circumstances of that case, an overall discount of 50% was appropriate. However, that was a case of commercial drug supply, in which the applicant had given assistance to the authorities leading to a person higher up in the supply chain being charged. The applicant had been threatened and assaulted as a result of providing that assistance. The sentencing judge found that he held ""realistic fears for his safety, fears that are shared by the police involved in this matter"": see the judgment of Buddin J at [12]. 

27Broadly speaking, the same is true of three cases to which Buddin J referred at [22] - [26], each of them a serious drug case in which the offender had provided assistance to the authorities at significant personal risk and in each of which this court held that a combined discount in excess of 50% was appropriate. These were R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195, R v OPA [2004] NSWCCA 464 and R v AMT [2005] NSWCCA 151. 

28Clearly, the present case is not of that kind. There is no evidence of any threat to this applicant's personal safety. As I have said, while his Honour acknowledged the risk that he may have to spend part of his sentence in protection, there was no evidence that that would be the case and, in any event, no evidence whether his being on protection would adversely affect the conditions of his custody. 

29The Crown prosecutor in this court referred us to R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92, 172 A Crim R 151, in which Howie J said at [5]: 

""In my opinion discounts for a plea and assistance of more than 40 percent should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted in a case where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population."" 

In the same case Latham J said at [54]: 

""While there is no fixed tariff for assistance to the authorities, discounts customarily ranged between 20 percent and 50 percent. There have been comparatively rare cases where a discount in the order of 55 percent or 60 percent has been given. Generally speaking however, a discount of 50 percent is regarded as appropriate to assistance of a very high order. No doubt, that is in part a reflection of the principle that a discount for assistance must not produce a result which is disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender."" 

McClellan CJ at CL expressed his agreement with the judgments of both Howie J and Latham J. 

30These observations are a guide to the exercise of a discretion but, of course, they are in no sense prescriptive. It is trite to say that the discretion is one to be exercised in the light of the facts of the case at hand. The combined discount arrived at in the present case was clearly within the proper exercise of that discretion and, in my view, no error has been shown in his Honour's approach. 

31These grounds are not made out. 

Ground 5 - Restitution 

32This ground complains that his Honour failed to take into account the applicant's offer to make restitution and the hardship that that would entail. 

33In his evidence the applicant promised to repay the money which he had received, $106,500. To do so he would have to sell an investment property, as well as the family home. His Honour described the sale of the investment property as ""hardly any hardship to him,"" but noted that the sale of the family home would leave his wife and children living in rented accommodation. His Honour described this hardship as not ""in any way unusual"" but accepted that the applicant would have to serve his sentence ""in the knowledge that his wrongdoing has led to his wife and children having to leave the family home behind."" 

34In the event, his Honour ordered that the amount received by the applicant be repaid, noting that that would mean that the properties would have to be sold. His Honour added: 

""This is not a matter of mitigation at all. I note that the offender's misconduct caused a larger loss than he is willing to repay and, in any case, it is not a matter of mitigation that reparation is paid. It is an aggravating factor if it is not."" 

35While noting that his Honour had ordered the payment of compensation, Ms Nash relied upon the applicant's voluntary undertaking to make restitution by selling the family home and the investment property. In fact, at the time of the sentence proceedings he had put both properties on the market. Apart from the applicant's remorse, she argued, this was a mitigating circumstance of itself. 

36In R v Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446, the offender had defrauded his employer of a considerable sum of money. Before he was sentenced he had made full restitution by selling the home in which he had lived with his mother (and in which his brother and sister also had an interest). 

37Delivering the leading judgment, Hunt CJ at CL said at 448: 

""In many of these cases, some emphasis has been placed upon the fact that the amount involved has voluntarily been repaid, but in my view it would be wrong to interpret those cases as supporting any proposition that an offender is able to purchase mitigation. Where there has been a substantial degree of sacrifice involved in the repayment, that is a matter which may properly be taken into account by way of mitigation. Otherwise, in my view, it is more a matter of aggravation when there has been a loss which is effectively irretrievable than a matter of mitigation when the loss has simply been made good. In this case, there was considerable sacrifice - not only on the part of the applicant but also on the part of his family."" 

Presumably, it is the second last sentence in that passage which was the source of his Honour's observation in the present case that the failure to make reparation was an aggravating factor. 

38In Phelan , both Smart and James JJ agreed with the Chief Judge. However, on the question of restitution Smart J added (at 450): 

""I regard restitution as an important factor in this type of case, and I would not wish to restrict the use which could be made of that. So much depends on the circumstances of the case."" 

39In R v Conway [2001] NSWCCA 51, 121 A Crim R 177, an offender who had defrauded the Social Security system had paid back about half of the money she had obtained by the time she appeared for sentence, and was prepared to sell her home, if necessary, to raise the money outstanding. The leading judgment was given by Heydon JA (as he then was), with whom Bell J and Smart AJ agreed. Phelan was referred to: [10]. Heydon JA held that the sentencing judge had correctly given weight to the reparation which the offender had made and which she intended to make: [17] ff. In particular, his Honour noted that, against the background of a hard life, it would be ""a real sacrifice"" for her to be compelled to sell the home where she had lived and with which ""she presumably had some happy associations ..."": [22]. 

40A different conclusion was reached in Stratford v R [2007] NSWCCA 279, another case in which the offender had defrauded his employer. He had been able to make full reparation prior to sentence from the proceeds of the settlement of a civil action, together with an amount withdrawn from his superannuation benefits, an amount borrowed from his wife and further borrowings secured against his home. McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Harrison and Fullerton JJ agreed, after referring to Phelan , said at [24]: 

""In the present case the applicant was able to provide the funds to repay the stolen monies from within his own and his family's resources. Although the consequence is that he must carry debts he has not been required to sell his home or, so far as the evidence discloses, suffer a very significant change in his family's standard of living."" 

41It seems that the consideration of this issue in Stratford focused upon remorse as a mitigating factor, as elucidated in s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as follows: 

""(i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if: 

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and 

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both) ..."" 

At [25], McClellan CJ at CL noted that the sentencing judge had been mindful of that provision and had ""correctly identified that the extent of the remorse was informed by the sacrifice which the applicant had made."" That being so, his Honour found no error in the judge's approach to the issue of restitution. 

42This brings me, then, to the case upon which Ms Nash placed particular reliance: Thewlis v R [2008] NSWCCA 176, 186 A Crim R 279. The facts of that case were very different from the present case and from the other decisions to which I have referred. It involved an offence of violence, the offender having mounted a serious attack with a knife upon another man. However, immediately after doing so, he took steps to ensure that the victim received medical treatment. The issue in the appeal was whether that conduct sounded in mitigation of sentence. 

43The leading judgment was given by Simpson J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Price J agreed. Her Honour noted that the offender had promptly taken ""steps to ameliorate the consequences"" of his attack: [39]. She concluded that conduct of that kind, while not reducing the objective gravity of the offending, warranted ""some consideration in mitigation of sentence"": [43]. 

44Importantly for present purposes, her Honour said that the offender's conduct went ""well beyond throwing light on remorse or contrition, which were also well established"": [38]. She described it as ""something which ... the applicant was entitled to have taken into account not as a mitigating factor catalogued in s 21A(3), but as a particular, and an unusual, circumstance which may be called ameliorative conduct, justifying a measure of leniency on that particular basis:"" [40]. 

45Her Honour continued at [41]: 

""The notion is not unique. There have been cases, such as property crimes, where leniency is justified because reparation has been voluntarily made prior to any charges being brought or anticipated. That is an appropriate analogy."" 

Her Honour then referred at [42] to New South Wales and interstate authority, including Phelan and Conway . Spigelman CJ, in a short concurring judgment, also referred to Phelan and, in particular, to the statement by Hunt CJ at CL that repayment may properly be taken into account by way of mitigation where ""there has been a substantial degree of sacrifice involved ... ."" The Chief Justice noted at [3] that that statement of principle had been subsequently applied in cases involving the fraudulent misappropriation of money, citing Stratford as one of them. His Honour continued at [4]: 

""The reasons in Phelan were clearly appropriate in the context of a crime involving the loss of money. They, however, emphasise that something special is required for ameliorative conduct to result in mitigation of sentence. Merely taking a step to redress the effect of a crime on victims is not of itself enough."" 

46Some of the observations in Thewlis , including those of the Chief Justice which I have quoted, must be understood in the unusual factual context of that case. What is important, however, is that voluntary reparation in property crimes was characterised as ameliorative conduct as Simpson J explained it. It was not seen merely as an incident of remorse, although clearly the two notions overlap. It was seen as a factor which might justify a measure of leniency in its own right. 

47In each of the cases to which I have referred the offender had made restitution, in whole or in part, at the time of sentence. That is not so of the present case. The Crown prosecutor submitted that that was a complete answer to this ground. That submission was founded upon the assumption that the focus of reparation is upon remorse as a mitigating factor, as expressed in s 21A(3)(i). The Crown prosecutor referred to the observation of Latham J in R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304 at [34] that ""that mitigating factor is directed to reparation already made by the offender as at the time of sentence."" However, in the light of the subsequent decision in Thewlis , the issue is not as simple as that. 

48In my view, his Honour did fall into error in rejecting out of hand the applicant's willingness to make reparation. Its significance may well have been diminished by the fact that no payment had yet been made at the time of sentence and, apparently, the applicant intended to repay only the amount which he had received. Nor could it be said that he had attempted restitution ""prior to any charges being brought or anticipated,"" as Simpson J put it in Thewlis at [41]. That said, the same is true in the cases of Phelan and Conway , in both of which it appears that reparation was undertaken after the offender was charged. 

49Nevertheless, the applicant's undertaking to make reparation to the extent which he specified, and the steps he had taken to that end by putting the two properties on the market, were entitled to some weight in his favour. The hardship occasioned by the sale of the family home is not dissimilar to that identified in Phelan . 

50That being so, it is unnecessary to express a view about his Honour's assertion that failure to make reparation would be an aggravating factor. The observation of Hunt CJ at CL in Phelan that it is more a matter of aggravation when an offence has caused a loss which is effectively irretrievable should be approached with some caution. Since Phelan was decided in 1993 the expression ""matter of aggravation"" has become something of a term of art, thanks largely to the jurisprudence engendered by s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I doubt that the former Chief Judge was saying anything more than that, in determining sentence, an offence which has caused a loss which cannot be made good is likely to be viewed more seriously, but the extent to which reparation sounds in mitigation will depend upon the degree of sacrifice involved. The matter not having been argued before us, this is not the occasion to examine it. 

51This ground is made out. 

Grounds 6 & 7 - Mental illness 

52These grounds are concerned with the manner in which his Honour approached evidence of the applicant's mental illness. Reports by a psychiatrist and a psychologist concluded that he was suffering from depression at the time of the offences and, in addition, the psychologist diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder. 

53I have referred to evidence that the applicant was brought up in circumstances of financial difficulty, and that he was the victim of sexual abuse at a young age over a period of 3 years. In a comprehensive history to the psychologist, he said that he was ridiculed at school because of his family's poverty, which was evident from the standard of his clothing. He also said that his father would inflict corporal punishment upon him, perhaps venting his frustration at his lack of employment, and that he would often be fearful of him. 

54The sexual abuse was perpetrated by a swimming coach. He told the psychologist that he was fearful of disclosing it because of his father's unpredictability and propensity to violence and that, indeed, he had not disclosed it to anyone until his consultation with the psychologist in preparation for the sentence proceedings. In addition, in 2002 allegations were made against him that he had received sexual favours for appointing people to various positions within the RTA. He was exonerated after an investigation of those allegations, but during that investigation he received a death threat from one of the complainants. 

55Against the background of this material, the psychologist diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder with comorbid depression. He concluded that in committing the offences the applicant had ""acted with a sense of disregard for the consequences of his actions"", reflecting ""a form of self-abuse"", with the applicant feeling that he would end up going to prison or, if not, would probably end up dead. The psychiatrist diagnosed depression, but not post-traumatic stress disorder. He concluded that the applicant ""committed an impropriety while depressed, and it is therefore possible that his judgment may have been affected in ways that would not have been the case if he were not suffering from a mood disorder at that time."" 

56As I have said, one of the matters upon which his Honour found the applicant was entitled to rely was ""the circumstance that his depression reduced his ability to reason about the wrongfulness of his conduct."" His Honour continued: 

""On the other hand, it remains the case that his offending was seriously criminal, involving many separate acts of criminality over an extensive period of time. There is a very important need for a sentence to be imposed upon the offender which reflects the principles of general deterrence. That remains the case even though the offender was depressed at the time that he committed these offences. Although the offender was depressed, the decision to assist his friend and also himself in various corrupt ways was one which even a depressed person was fully aware, involved serious wrongdoing."" 

57Ms Nash submitted that in that passage his Honour failed to have regard to the principles concerning the bearing of mental illness upon general deterrence, and she complained that nowhere in the remarks on sentence did his Honour refer to the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosed by the psychologist. 

58Dealing first with the issue of the post-traumatic stress disorder, that was a diagnosis arrived at by the psychologist but not the psychiatrist. I would think that diagnosis is more the province of a psychiatrist than of a psychologist. While his Honour did not refer to it, he did set out in his remarks the stressors in the applicant's life to which the psychologist attributed it. In any event, the precise diagnosis of the applicant's mental illness at the relevant time was not to the point. What was significant was the evidence, which his Honour accepted, that his judgment in committing the offences was affected by mental illness. 

59This is not the occasion to review the authorities on the bearing of mental illness upon the need for general deterrence, which are familiar. The principles governing the relevance of mental illness to sentence were summarised by McClellan CJ at CL, with reference to the authorities, in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, 205 A Crim R 1, at [177] - [178]. What is relevant for present purposes is that the fact that a person whose judgment is affected by mental illness in committing an offence retains an awareness of the wrongfulness of his or her conduct is relevant to the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence, but is not determinative of that question. The circumstances of such a case will often require that general deterrence, while still significant, should be afforded less weight. 

60R v Fell [2004] NSWCCA 235 was a Crown appeal in which one of the grounds of appeal was expressed as follows: 

""The Respondent's psychiatric condition was not such as to preclude knowledge of the gravity of his actions and hardly lessened the requirement of general deterrence."" 

Having set that ground out in the judgment, the court (Giles JA, Hulme and Adams JJ) observed at [26]: 

""While the first element in this ground may be accepted, the second does not follow. As Gleeson CJ said in Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 70, 'The circumstance that an offender suffers from a mental disorder may well be of considerable relevance in a number of respects to the sentencing task.' As a passage quoted by his Honour on the following page makes clear, one of these respects is that such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others. Others were referred to by Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]:- 

'The reason for this approach lies in the circumstance that the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing. Moreover, such a condition is inherent and its presence does not depend upon any element of choice.'"" 

61Put shortly, Ms Nash's submission was that the passage from the remarks which I have quoted conveys that his Honour gave full weight to the need for general deterrence despite his finding that the applicant's depression reduced his ability to reason about the wrongfulness of his conduct. She argued that less weight should have been placed upon general deterrence in the light of that finding. 

62I have given this submission careful reflection. On the face of it, Ms Nash's argument about the effect of the quoted passage is sound. What his Honour said could convey that he treated the applicant's depression as a matter which lessened his moral culpability but did not in any way diminish the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence. On the other hand, it could mean that, although general deterrence should be afforded less weight because of the applicant's impaired judgment, his persistent dishonesty was such that it remained a significant consideration. 

63That conclusion would have been consistent with authority, of which this very experienced sentencing judge would have been aware. As has often been said in this court, it is important to remember the pressure under which District Court judges work when dealing with sentence matters and it is inappropriate to subject their remarks on sentence to fine analysis. In the event, I find it unnecessary to decide this ground because, error having been established in relation to the question of restitution, it is open to this court to re-sentence the applicant in the exercise of its own discretion. 

Ground 8 - Manifestly excessive? 

64As the court is to re-sentence, it is unnecessary to decide the last ground, that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive. However, given such pattern of sentence for offending of this kind which emerges from the cases to which I am about to refer, I am satisfied that it is heavier than was called for in the circumstances. It is reasonable to view the aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 5 years as the product of his Honour's discount of 40% for the applicant's pleas of guilty and assistance. Viewed in that way, the starting point was an overall sentence of 8 years and 4 months. 

65Ms Nash referred us to a number of cases of a broadly similar kind decided in this court between 1991 and 1994. As the Crown prosecutor pointed out, those cases are too old to be a reliable guide to current sentencing patterns. However, she also referred to two more recent cases. 

66One was Fell (supra), which was decided in 2004. That offender had pleaded guilty to defrauding his employer of a large sum of money by a series of offences under s 178BA of the Crimes Act , committed over a period in excess of one year. He was dealt with by a suspended sentence of 22 months. In dismissing the Crown appeal, this court found that sentence to be within the legitimate bounds of discretion. However, that offender had a particularly strong subjective case and there was substantial delay in the prosecution against him being launched. 

67The other case was R v Blundell [2008] NSWCCA 63, 70 NSWLR 660. That offender was an insurance broker who defrauded his clients of a substantial sum of money over a period of several months. He pleaded guilty to three charges of fraudulent misappropriation (s 178A of the Crimes Act , carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 7 years). His appeal against that sentence was unsuccessful. In his case there had been very substantial delay before he came to be sentenced, during which period he had made significant steps towards rehabilitation. Moreover, it was necessary for the sentencing judge to maintain relativity between his sentence and a lenient sentence which had earlier been imposed by a different judge upon his brother, who was his partner in the business and who had been involved in similar fraudulent activity. 

68These two unusual cases are of no assistance in assessing the appropriate sentence in the present case. However, some assistance is forthcoming from the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Stratford (supra). As I have said, that was yet another case of an employee defrauding his employer of a large sum of money, on this occasion over a period of about three years. The offender pleaded guilty to a number of charges of fraud by an officer of a company (s 176A of the Crimes Act , carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 10 years). His appeal against an overall sentence of 3 1/2 years with a non-parole period of 2 years was dismissed. 

69In the course of his judgment, at [33] ff, the Chief Judge briefly reviewed twelve decisions of this court in what might loosely be described as serious fraud cases. One of them was decided in 1993, but the others were between 1997 and 2005. All of them involved multiple charges, the majority also being under s 176A. The periods over which the offences were committed ranged from a matter of weeks to several years. In one case the amount involved was $80,000, but in the others the amounts were comfortably into six figures or, in a few cases, millions. In some cases there had been reparation to a greater or lesser degree, and in some the offender had been suffering from depression. 

70Half of these cases were Crown appeals. In all but three the offenders had pleaded guilty. Significantly, in none of them had there been assistance to the authorities. Sentences, either affirmed by this court or imposed by it, ranged from 2 years to 5 years. Five year sentences were imposed in two cases, but in the remainder sentences were between 2 years and 4 years. Non-parole periods ranged between 18 months and 3 years and 3 months, the majority being 18 months or 2 years. 

71The Crown prosecutor did not take us to any comparable cases. She referred us to R v Hawker [2001] NSWCCA 148, another serious fraud case, in which Wood CJ at CL said at [17] - [18]: 

""[17] There is a danger in endeavouring to extract a 'range' from a limited group of decisions on appeal, or from sentencing statistics. Some of the cases here selected by the applicant were Crown appeals in which the principle of double jeopardy or that relating to special discretion attaching to Crown appeals, were applicable. Others were cases involving quite different objective and subjective considerations, as well as differing sums of money. Some involved offenders such as solicitors or others holding fiduciary office or positions of trust, and others of which involved employees of no great seniority. In some instances, the offences were relatively simple and of short duration, and in other cases they were complex and prolonged. 


[18] The need for care in attempting any such comparison as that suggested here was recently underlined by Spigelman CJ in Slater [2001] NSWCCA 65 at [50] - [52]."" 

72Hawker was a two judge decision. However, apart from the fact that they carry the authority of the former Chief Judge, those observations have been cited in subsequent decisions by three judge benches: see, for example, R v Martin [2005] NSWCCA 190, per Johnson J (with whom Hunt AJA and Hulme J agreed) at [56]. I bear that admonition in mind when having regard to the schedule of cases referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in Stratford (of which Martin was one). It is trite to say that each of these cases turned on its own facts, and in none of them were the charges the same as those in the present case. Nevertheless, such pattern as does emerge from them fortifies me in my view that a lesser aggregate sentence is appropriate in the present case. 

73In my view, the appropriate starting point for the overall sentence is imprisonment for 7 years. His Honour's discount of 40% for the pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities, which I would adopt, would lead to a term a little over 4 years, which I would round off at 4 years. Finding special circumstances, as his Honour did, I would structure the sentences in such a way as to set an effective non-parole period of 2 years. 

74I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentences passed in the District Court and, in lieu, would sentence the applicant as follows: 


On each of the charges of obtaining a benefit by deception relating to the Mays Hill tidal flow activities, a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months, dating from 19 August 2010 and expiring on 18 August 2011; 

On each of the charges of obtaining a benefit by deception relating to the Rail Corp shutdowns, imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months, commencing on 19 February 2011 and expiring on 18 February 2012; 

On each of the charges of corruptly receiving a benefit, imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year, commencing on 19 August 2011 and expiring on 18 August 2012, and a balance of term of 2 years, commencing on 19 August 2012 and expiring on 18 August 2014. 

I would direct that the applicant be released on parole on 18 August 2012. 

75Grove AJ: I agree with Hidden J.

2708747,R v MB [2011] NSWSC 1376,"Judgment 

1RS HULME J: The Prisoner stands to be sentenced for the offence of the manslaughter of Gary Kemlo, of which offence a jury found him guilty on 31 March last. I instruct myself that any findings of fact I make must be consistent with the jury's verdict, that I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any matters of aggravation not necessarily implicit in the jury's verdict but that in the case of matters of mitigation, it is sufficient if I am satisfied of them on the balance of probabilities. 

2In the early hours of 22 September 2008, the Prisoner then aged 16 years and 8 months, left his parents' home in which he was living, taking with him a boning knife and yellow torch and walked some 2.9 kilometres to Mr Kemlo's house. The Prisoner also took with him some gloves so that he would not leave fingerprints. When Mr Kemlo opened his front door, the Prisoner stabbed him a number of times. The Prisoner said it was five times. 

3The Prisoner then took a number of items including a laptop computer and some $2,600 from the house and placed them in the deceased's car. He then obtained petrol from Mr Kemlo's shed, spread it throughout the upstairs and downstairs of the house and then set the house on fire. The Prisoner agreed that this was done to destroy the evidence. The Prisoner then drove away in Mr Kemlo's car back to the vicinity of his own home. 

4There, again with a view to destroying evidence, he made an attempt to burn his clothing that was blood-stained along with the deceased's wallet. The attempt can only be described as amateurish because when later that morning his mother discovered the items in a drum, the burning had been very incomplete. The Prisoner then picked up an X-box that he owned - an item which he had taken a while to pay for and which was probably his most valuable possession - placed it in the deceased's car and proceeded in the car to the south side of Inverell. 

5He parked the car, walked some distance to premises of a friend Donna Bates, left his X-box and the items he had stolen there, bought some cigarettes at a shop, went to the premises of another friend Clint Truman who, at the Prisoner's request, bought some cannabis and alcohol for the Prisoner. While drinking, the Prisoner, in the words of Mr Truman, ""had a bit of giggle ... to himself"" but when asked what about, said, ""nothing"" and kept giggling. After a time, the Prisoner left and went to premises occupied by Mr Bradley Truman. There the Prisoner asked, ""Do the police come here often?"" and, a little later, ""'cause I slit someone's throat and the police could be here soon"". The police, in fact, arrived soon after arresting the Prisoner some time after 4.30 that afternoon. He has been in custody ever since. 

6The Prisoner gave evidence that when walking to Mr Kemlo's house on the night of his death he felt angry towards the deceased and he was hearing voices that were telling him to kill Mr Kemlo because of the latter's sexual abuse (of the Prisoner). 

7For completeness I should add that the Crown had submitted to the jury that the Prisoner's motive in attending the deceased's house on the night of the latter's death was theft and the killing occurred in consequence of the deceased interfering in some way with the Prisoner's planned activities. It seems to me that the jury's verdict involves a rejection of this theory. In any event, I regard it as less likely than that the Prisoner, for whatever reason, set out to kill the deceased. 

Diminished Responsibility 

8The Prisoner was arraigned on a charge of murder. The jury acquitted him of that charge and convicted him of the lesser offence of manslaughter. It is common ground between counsel that the basis of the jury's verdict was that the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind had been established. 

9I am satisfied that of the possible explanations for the verdict of manslaughter, that partial defence is the most likely and was established on the balance of probabilities. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the Prisoner's offence was not committed in consequence of a loss of self- control and his intent precludes a finding of manslaughter on a simple basis of an unlawful and dangerous act. 

10Prior to the killing, the Prisoner had had less than an ideal life. His mother was profoundly deaf due to her mother having contracted Rubella during pregnancy. The Prisoner's relationship with his mother seems to have been reasonable but communication was very difficult, a fact to which I can attest in consequence of her giving evidence during the trial. 

11There were substantial conflicts between the Prisoner and his father who worked for the Roads and Traffic Authority and who came home on some week-ends. I am disposed to accept the evidence of the latter to the effect that he regarded the Prisoner as out of control, not taking his medication, not sleeping, pacing the floor, playing music repetitively and at an excessive volume despite requests to turn it down, and running away from home on at least two occasions. On the day of the killing, there was significant dissension within the Prisoner's household. The Prisoner's father had sought to find out or discuss the Prisoner's problems. The Prisoner's mother intervened. Things became heated. The Prisoner's father was angry, inter alia, about the Prisoner having taken and then smashed a family car a month or so earlier. According to the Prisoner's father, the Prisoner ""just more or less flew for us"" and the Prisoner's father got to the stage where he had ""a gutful"" and was more or less walking out, and letting the bank enforce its mortgage. According to what the Prisoner told Dr Greenberg later, the Prisoner's father had called the Prisoner names such as ""useless"" and ""a mistake"". 

12The Prisoner gave evidence that he was emotionally and physically abused by his father and physically abused by his brother. I am disposed to accept that this evidence is true to a significant degree although, in light of the evidence of the Prisoner's mother and of the Prisoner's sister and views I have reached as to the Prisoner's credibility, not to the extent that the Prisoner's evidence might suggest. At the same time, I have no doubt that the Prisoner was a source of considerable frustration in consequence of actions I refer to in these reasons. 

13I accept that the Prisoner was also the victim of a great deal of bullying at school about being fat and about his mother being deaf. The consequences of his innate intelligence and matters to which I refer must also have been frustrating for him. For example, school records of September 2001 record ""prefers gestures, poor language skills, reluctant verbal communicator, behind"". Another, of June 2002, describes him as ""working consistently but low achievement"". Thereafter things deteriorated. 

14Exhibit 3, which contained the just mentioned extracts, shows that the Prisoner for a number of years before his attack on Mr Kemlo was an extremely disturbed youth. He had substantial behavioural problems at school and although a report of mid-2007 says that his behaviour was generally satisfactory, it is clear that often he was not amenable to discipline. Earlier in 2007, he had been suspended for 20 days. In July 2006 and March 2007 there were reports of him failing to wash. Although the document refers to occasions when the Prisoner appeared to be appreciably better, depression and thoughts of suicide as far back as 2006 are a constant theme. A hospital emergency department note of 3 August 2008 refers to injury threats to his mother, to the Prisoner smiling inappropriately and escalating inappropriate behaviour. 

15For some years before his attack on the deceased, the Prisoner manifested some unusual actions. He would pace up and down the floor for periods of time, laughing to himself or would sit on the floor, rocking. A neighbour, Colleen Quillen, gave evidence that when he came to her place, he would sit quietly on the end of the couch and would giggle to himself with his body slumped over and his head down for half an hour to an hour. On one occasion his sister asked him why he was laughing to himself and he replied, ""because of the voices in my head"". The Prisoner acknowledged a habit of playing music at very loud volume saying that this was a way to escape his emotions. 

16The Prisoner was born in January 1992. When he was about 12, his sister found him in the chook pen with a knife, threatening to kill himself. When he was 14 or 15, his mother found him in his bedroom with a knife, saying that he did not want to be alive. Although it was not, I think, the subject of oral evidence, a hospital emergency department note of 7 September 2006 in Exhibit 3, said that the Prisoner had left a suicide note after an argument with his mother, and stolen and smashed his father's car. Exhibit 3 records that in about 2006 he seems to have been talking of blowing himself and everyone else up, but in December 2007 he was a lot brighter and not wanting to do so. 

17The taking of the family car that was the subject of discussion on 21 September 2008 occurred after the Prisoner had an argument with his mother. When taking the car - it would seem for a second time - he left a handwritten note:- 

I stole the car 
cya 
im sick of life 
sick of whats going on in my head and i hate people come near me and I will kill 

18Some distance south of Inverell on the Moonbi range, the car ran off the road. Tamworth Hospital emergency department notes record that the Prisoner was brought in by police and that the Prisoner:- 

Had been speeding up to 180 km, slowing down to 85-100 km/hr around the bends lost control of the car around the bend causing car to slide up a ramp designed to slow down trucks with brake failure. 

19To Dr Greenberg, a psychiatrist who saw the Prisoner after his arrest, the Prisoner said that he had driven the vehicle into a rock cliff in an attempt to kill himself. In evidence he maintained that he had taken the car in an attempt to kill himself, saying that he had not told the police officer who attended the accident that because he was afraid that he would be put back in hospital. The account he had given that officer was to the effect that he had been driving too quickly, had hit some loose gravel, lost control, hit the concrete kerb, realised the steering was gone and parked the car up the safety ramp. My inclination is to think that this was not a suicide attempt although it is clear that the Prisoner at least contemplated that course of conduct. 

20In May 2010 whilst in custody, the Prisoner slit his wrists in what does appear to have been an attempt to kill himself. 

21It should be mentioned that the Prisoner seems to have indulged to an appreciable extent in using cannabis. To Dr Greenberg and in evidence, the Prisoner said that his cannabis use commenced when he was 13, that is, in about 2005. Documents in Exhibit 3 suggest that this usage had become significant by or prior to August 2008. Although a note in Exhibit 3 created by Ms Rhonda Davis on 15 September 2008 or, as it bears two dates, possibly on 7 September 2008, recorded that the Prisoner was using $20 of cannabis a week, in evidence the Prisoner said that, leading up to the killing of Mr Kemlo, he was using as much as $1,000 worth a week, stealing to help fund this habit. While I accept, largely on the basis of Exhibit 3, that the Prisoner's usage was significant, I do not accept his evidence that his usage approached the $1,000 worth that he claimed. Inverell is a small community and the Prisoner lived out of town. I do not believe he could have indulged in the degree of stealing and illicit selling of stolen goods implicit in his evidence to the degree sufficient to support a habit of the extent he claimed. 

22In evidence, the Prisoner said that his best recollection was that he had had cannabis on the day before the killing but not on the day of the killing. To Dr Nielssen the Prisoner said he had not had any cannabis for a week before the killing although he also said that his pattern was to smoke throughout the day when the drug was available. 

23Many of the above activities led to the Prisoner being taken to a doctor or hospital. The possibility that he suffered from a bipolar disorder was raised as early as 2006 although one of the notes records that there was no clear history of highs - a factor which, on my understanding, is an essential element of a bipolar diagnosis. 

24Some evidence indicates that from age 13 he was also abusing alcohol. However, there is insufficient information to come to any concluded view as to the extent of this. 

25The Prisoner left school in August 2007 and worked then for a time at the local abattoir. He left home for some months and then returned home some months prior to Mr Kemlo's death. He seems to have ceased his employment after he left home and his estimate of when he returned home was about four months before Mr Kemlo's death. 

Sexual abuse 

26It was urged on the Prisoner's behalf that a cause of his killing Mr Kemlo was that the latter had been guilty of a great deal of sexual abuse of the Prisoner. The Prisoner was, directly or indirectly, almost the only source of evidence on this topic. There are some improbabilities and serious inconsistencies in what he has said from time to time and it is accordingly necessary to consider this claim with considerable care. 

27The Prisoner's evidence was to the following effect. He first met the deceased when he was aged 8 years old and shopping with his mother. Thereafter, his mother would drop him off at the deceased's place each weekend. Then and when the Prisoner was aged 9, this weekend visiting continued and their activities involved watching TV, having lunch together or going to town. The Prisoner's visiting of the deceased followed an offer the latter had made to assist the Prisoner with his school work but, according to the Prisoner, no tutoring ever occurred. 

28When the Prisoner was aged 10, the deceased introduced him to pornographic magazines and videos and at age 10 the deceased would put his hands down the inside of the Prisoner's pants: when he was 11 or 12 the deceased took his own clothes off and masturbated. At first the Prisoner kept his clothes on. 

29At age 13 the Prisoner confronted the deceased who responded by threatening to kill the Prisoner's family. This worried the Prisoner, inter alia, because his mother was vulnerable due to her deafness and his father was away during the week. This was the only time, or one of only two times, that the Prisoner confronted the deceased although there were other times - there was some conflict in the evidence - when the deceased threatened to kill the Prisoner's family. 

30At age 14, and I am still recounting the Prisoner's evidence, the deceased commenced to perform acts of oral and anal sex on the Prisoner and the Prisoner performed similar acts on the deceased. These activities would last 5 to 10 minutes at a time and occurred each weekend when the Prisoner was 15 and 16 except for the period of months when the Prisoner was 16 and living in Inverell away from home. 

31According to the Prisoner, when he first returned home after that period in Inverell, the deceased came to the Prisoner's parents' home, said he wanted the Prisoner to go to his place and if he didn't the deceased was going to kill the Prisoner and his family. Because of this threat, the Prisoner complied with the deceased's wishes and thereafter each weekend the abuse continued. On the Saturday before his death, the deceased took the Prisoner down to his place where he made the Prisoner get undressed and anal and oral sex occurred. 

32The Prisoner said he had been too afraid to go to the police. When it was put to him that he knew that what the deceased was doing was illegal and that if the Prisoner complained to police it was likely the deceased would be locked up and would not be capable of carrying out any threats, the Prisoner said that the deceased had said ""he would get someone else to do it"". 

33The Prisoner's mother gave similar evidence as to the time the Prisoner and deceased met and that when younger the Prisoner would visit the deceased every weekend. Much of her evidence was difficult to understand but the tenor of it was that visits were less frequent when the Prisoner was older. She said that when the Prisoner was 16 he went to Mr Kemlo's only once or twice, when he was 15 not at all and that she could not remember the frequency of visits when the Prisoner was 14. She said that the Prisoner would visit the deceased's house on some weekends when he was 11 and 12 and sometimes in school holidays. She agreed that when the Prisoner was 15 and 16, she did not always know where he was. The Prisoner gave evidence in similar terms to that last statement. 

34The Prisoner gave evidence that he supported his cannabis habit by carrying out break and enter offences two to three times a week. Asked how he got from his place 28 to 30 kilometres out of town in and out to Inverell, he said that he would stay in Inverell once a week for the weekend, nearly every weekend, carrying out the offences, disposing of the property and obtaining cannabis. When it was put to him that if he was in Inverell he was not at the deceased's, he said he used to be driven back and forth by his mother all the time. 

35The Prisoner's father agreed that the Prisoner kept going to Mr Kemlo's house from about the age of 10 through to when he was 16. The Prisoner's father was not asked as to the frequency of this visiting. 

36The Prisoner's sister gave evidence of the Prisoner and Mr Kemlo meeting in terms not dissimilar to the evidence of the Prisoner and that at that time Mr Kemlo had ""approached us in Gilgai shops about taking the Prisoner down there he said maths tutoring"" (sic). She said that continued for about two years or so. However, while she would visit for a time, she ceased living with the family when the Prisoner was about aged 7 to 9. 

37She said that on one occasion when the Prisoner returned from Mr Kemlo's, he was crying and she saw a bruise on his face. On other occasions the Prisoner would return with lollies or money up to a maximum of $50. 

38One other matter of evidence that is relevant to the credibility of the Prisoner's account is evidence, principally from the Prisoner's father, that the Prisoner used to take off whenever the deceased visited the Prisoner's household, especially if ""Garry brought his little boyfriend - a child of about 13 or 14 - around"". There was no cross-examination of the Prisoner's father directed to identifying with any degree of confidence the period when the ""taking off"" occurred. 

39The deceased visited the Prisoner's property at about 8 or 9 am on 21 September 2008 and, as happened on other occasions, according to the Prisoner's father, the Prisoner took off straight away. The Prisoner's mother said that on the occasion of Mr Kemlo's visit on 21 September 1995, the Prisoner remained in his bedroom. I do not regard these accounts as inconsistent to any significant degree. 

40A Mr Polosak also gave evidence. At age about 15 he had lived at the Kemlo residence before Mr Kemlo moved in. For about two weeks both lived there. Thereafter, Mr Polosak visited from time to time. On one such occasion, the Prisoner was sitting at a table doing homework and the deceased was helping him. Mr Polosak was asked no questions on the topic of sexual activities. 

41The first time the Prisoner seems to have made any remarks concerning sexual abuse was about 9am or later on 22 September 2008 after killing the deceased and after he had driven into Inverell. There he was observed by a Ms Whittaker to be in a state that varied between normal and agitated, crying and swearing and was heard by Ms Whittaker to say more than once words to the effect, ""Fucken dog. Fucken molesting cunt"". On one occasion, Ms Whittaker heard the Prisoner say, ""fucking dog wants to molest me. He deserves what he gets"". 

42The topic of sexual abuse was the subject of a deal of evidence by persons who had contact with the Prisoner after he was arrested. In that connection it may be relevant to record that the Prisoner spent some time in Kariong and Baxter Juvenile Detention Centres and when talking to Ms Danielle Castles, a psychiatrist, in February and March 2010, the Prisoner said that the deceased was a nice man, that the Prisoner was ashamed that he had made false allegations about him and that the reason for the allegations was that other inmates at Kariong had made suggestions that the allegations might provide the Prisoner with a defence. In evidence, the Prisoner maintained that what he had told Ms Castles was a lie. 

43Earlier, on a number of occasions and despite repeated questioning, the Prisoner had told a Juvenile Justice worker, Mr Lockwood, that he had not been sexually abused. 

44A number of other persons gave evidence of what they had been told by the Prisoner on the topic of sexual abuse. These included a barrister and four psychiatrists who gave evidence in his trial. 

Dr Nielssen 

45One psychiatrist was Dr Nielssen who first interviewed the Prisoner on 30 January 2009. The Prisoner told Dr Nielssen:- 

It all began when my parents started fighting and then started calling me names. Dad left and when mum went to bed I got a knife and I went down to Garry Kemlo's place. I was feeling angry and depressed. He (Mr Kemlo) was just a target. 

46The Prisoner told Dr Nielssen that the deceased had not done anything wrong to him and that the Prisoner had done some work for the deceased, mowing lawns and helping with cementing and that the deceased had paid him fairly. 

47The Prisoner denied smoking cannabis the week before the killing and being affected by alcohol or any drugs. 

48Dr Nielssen saw the Prisoner again on 2 July 2009. During that interview, the Prisoner said he had been the subject of several sexual advances by the deceased between the ages of 11 and 13 the advances taking the form of the deceased placing his arm around the Prisoner and rubbing his genital area through his clothes. The deceased made jokes on sexual themes and drew attention to sexual themes on television but did not put on any pornographic material or expose himself or ask the Prisoner to touch him. The Prisoner explained not mentioning the sexual advances in their first interview because he was ashamed of what had happened and had not discussed the events with anybody. The Prisoner said counsellors at Kariong had become aware because of intercepted letters. 

49On 5 April 2009, the Prisoner had written to a friend Tracey Downes, saying that he wanted to get off his chest that he had been sexually abused by the deceased. The account provided by the Prisoner in that letter was by no means comprehensive but said that the abuse had occurred or commenced - the letter which became Exhibit L is not clear - when the Prisoner was aged 10 or 11. The letter was read by prison authorities prior to being posted. 

50It appears that in about March 2009, the Prisoner had also told his brother that he had been sexually abused. 

Mr Bruce 

51On 9 November 2009, Mr Bruce, a Public Defender who had been briefed to appear for the Prisoner, raised with him the fact that the Prisoner had informed Dr Nielssen that he had been sexually abused and received detailed instructions on the topic, I infer to the intent that abuse had occurred. 

52On 30 January 2010, Mr Bruce had an audio-visual conference with the Prisoner who, on that occasion said in relation to the sexual assaults, ""It's a lie"". Thereafter, Mr Bruce tendered advice to the Prisoner who, on 5 February 2010, pleaded guilty to murder. (He was later allowed to withdraw this plea.) 

Dr Greenberg 

53Dr Greenberg was the Prisoner's treating psychiatrist for about 12 months between about October 2008 and October 2009 while the latter was at Kariong but during this time did not discuss the alleged offence. However, when first seen by Dr Greenberg in October 2008, the Prisoner denied being sexually abused in his childhood though in, April 2009, the Prisoner told the doctor that he had, that the abuse involved the deceased, but the Prisoner refused otherwise to discuss the abuse. 

54On 22 November 2010, the Prisoner did provide details to Dr Greenberg. According to Dr Greenberg, the account that the Prisoner then gave him included the following:- 

When he was 10 years old, the deceased showed him pornography of heterosexual, homosexual and lesbian themes. Later, the deceased put his hands into the prisoner's pants saying ""It's fun and games"". This led to them getting undressed and engaging in oral, anal and masturbatory sex. The prisoner felt awkward but, at that time, didn't know it was wrong. 

At about age 13, he received sex education, realised what he was doing with the deceased was wrong and threatened to tell someone. The deceased then hit the prisoner and threatened to kill his parents. 

Because of these threats, the prisoner kept going to the deceased's and engaging in sexual activity until he was 16. 

On the weekend prior to the killing, the deceased came to the ... household and asked the accused to go to his home. He went because he didn't want his parents harmed and at the deceased's they watched television and then went to his bedroom and had anal and oral sex. They then went downstairs and watched more television. ... A few hours later, they again had sex in the (deceased's) lounge and watched more television ... And at approximately 6.00 pm on that evening, he went home. 

55The Prisoner told Dr Greenberg that they had sex ""like that"" on every weekend. Dr Greenberg said that the Prisoner gave him an account of similar activities ""the following day"" although other evidence indicates that the reference must have been to the day immediately prior to the killing. 

56Dr Greenberg took the view that whether or not the Prisoner was sexually abused was relevant to the issue of substantial impairment because it was only if he was sexually abused that his thinking and judgment was substantially impaired. Although I do not take this opinion into account, it might be mentioned also that Dr Greenberg expressed the view that whether the Prisoner was sexually abused was difficult to ascertain in light of the inconsistencies. 

Dr Nunn 

57Dr Nunn's first contact with the prisoner was after the latter had been transferred to the Bronte Unit after his apparent suicide attempt on 8 May 2010. Dr Nunn then saw the prisoner regularly. Dr Nunn's account of the prisoner's description of the sexual abuse he had suffered was to the effect:- 

When around 10 or 11 years of age, while sitting next to the deceased on a lounge watching television, the deceased put his hands into the prisoner's trousers fondling his genitals. When the prisoner was older, the deceased also procured the prisoner to anally penetrate him and later did the same to the prisoner. The prisoner was also procured to commit fellatio on the deceased. 

58Dr Nunn said that when reporting the history of sexual abuse, the Prisoner was sitting stooped, looking down, and had the facial expression of shame. The Prisoner found it difficult to talk, was hesitant in talking and had a marked physiological reaction of going red and being tense and distressed to a high level throughout the interview. The Prisoner exhibited these physical signs on each of the occasions Dr Nunn spoke to him on the topic. Dr Nunn placed weight on these symptoms because they are less subject to voluntary control than oral statements. 

Dr Lucas 

59According to Dr Lucas, the Prisoner said that ""when he was 11 or 12 he started to go to Mr Kemlo's place"". At first Mr Kemlo used to hold his hand and put an arm around him. As time progressed, using his words, ""he started to touch me in other places"". Asked what he meant he said ""Mr Kemlo put his hand down his pants"". He said ""they then ended up having sex"". Asked when that was, he said ""probably after a few years"". Asked what it involved, he said ""making me have anal sex, put my penis in his bum"". Asked where this occurred, he said ""in the house, in the loungeroom and the bedroom"". The frequency was probably three times a week. I asked what other sexual activity there might have been and he replied ""just putting penis in his bum"". I pushed the issue and he then replied, Mr Kemlo had done the same to him when he was 13 or 14. 

60Because the issue of sexual abuse is one which goes to mitigation, the onus of establishing it lies on the Prisoner. Given the extent of his lying and the degree of inconsistency between his accounts, and subject to the following remarks, I am not prepared to place any significant reliance on what he told the jury or Mr Bruce or the psychiatrists. I am by no means satisfied that his accounts are not influenced by what was suggested to him by fellow inmates. Nor did the Prisoner's demeanour in the witness box inspire another view. 

61I also find the Prisoner's evidence concerning weekend visits to Inverell difficult to reconcile at a practical level with visits to the deceased as regularly as the Prisoner asserted. Furthermore, that the Prisoner could defy the deceased's desires throughout the period of months the Prisoner was living in Inverell but, on returning to live at home, feel obliged to visit the deceased each weekend is also unlikely. Nor am I persuaded that threats by the deceased would have had the impact that the Prisoner alleges. 

62On the other hand, there remains an appreciable body of evidence that does support the view that there was some abuse. It strikes me as quite unlikely that the Prisoner was making up a tale of abuse when heard by Ms Whittaker. The Prisoner's reactions to the deceased's visits as recounted by his father argues significantly in favour of some impropriety having occurred, although such conduct also argues against the Prisoner having, even unwillingly, visited the deceased with anything like the frequency that the Prisoner alleged, at least unless he was a willing, if ashamed, participant and this has not been suggested. 

63The observations of Dr Nunn also argue in favour of abuse having occurred, although it is also to be noted that, as I adverted to in my summing up, both in the witness box and in the dock, the Prisoner spent a deal of time during his trial staring down at the floor in what could be described as a hang dog look. Furthermore, if, as the Crown suggested, the whole story of sexual abuse was a lie, that would account for at least some of the aspects of his demeanour referred to by Dr Nunn. 

64I have found resolution of this issue very difficult. However, ultimately I have come to the view that some sort of abuse must have occurred, although I believe it was nothing like as frequent as the Prisoner's evidence would suggest. Nor am I satisfied that it was as serious as the Prisoner alleges. More specifically, especially in light of the limited nature of the Prisoner's remarks detailed by Ms Whittaker and also those in the letter to Tracey Downes, I am not satisfied that there was any penetration. 

65On the other hand, I am disposed to accept that sexual abuse was a factor that operated on the Prisoner's mind in his determination to kill Mr Kemlo. Once one concludes that a robbery gone wrong is not the explanation for the killing, there are only two explanations left. One is the Prisoner's impairment of mind but it is impossible to conclude that that is a sufficient explanation on its own in circumstances where there is no suggestion that, except by sexual abuse, the deceased had ever, in any presently significant way, offended the Prisoner. The other explanation is sexual abuse. 

66The relative weight each of these matters had is not a matter susceptible of firm determination. All one can say is that, in light of the psychiatrists' evidence and the Prisoner's history the abnormality of mind was substantial and, I am not satisfied that, in the scale of such things, the sexual abuse was. Putting these things aside, the premeditation and deliberateness of the Prisoner's actions in taking the boning knife and gloves and walking almost 3 kilometres argues for adjudging his offence as objectively very serious. So does the fact that at least in part - as the Prisoner told Dr Nielssen - the deceased seems to have been a target of anger apparently inspired by dispute within the household in which the Prisoner lived. 

67Of course, there are other factors. One is the Prisoner's youth and in his case I have no doubt, immaturity. The relevant principles and statutory provisions to which regard must be had in this connection are set forth in the judgment of Garling J in R v NR [2011] NSWSC 280. It is unnecessary that I repeat the statutory provisions but the relevant principles, as his Honour noted, include the following:- 

(a) Considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence; 

(b) In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform with society's norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation; 

(c) The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for the offender's youth, not just their biological age; 

(d) Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring anti-social conduct. Of course, the weight to be given to a person's youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity: 

(e) The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in a way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity. 

68See also R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; (2001) 124 A Crim R 451. 

69Certainly, the Prisoner's offence falls within the description at the end of the passage just quoted. As in every case of manslaughter, an appropriate starting point is to recognise that what is involved is the felonious taking of a human life - see R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA, 12 December 1995, unreported), per Gleeson CJ. And it takes no great maturity to appreciate in the couse of a 3 kilometre walk, that stabbing another human being infringes the rights of others in a way that no civilised society can tolerate and is an extreme reaction to abuse that could have been dealt with in other ways. 

70It was also urged on the Prisoner's behalf that as his offence was inspired by sexual abuse, that fact operated in mitigation. Reliance was placed on observations in R v AGR (unreported, NSWCCA, 24 July 1998) and R v CB & IM [2006] NSWSC 261 where Buddin J regarded the principle as also applicable in the case of manslaughter. It was submitted that the motivation for the offence here was directly related to the sexual abuse perpetrated by the deceased, was not a case of revenge for past abuse and not a case where a more severe sentence is warranted in order to address issues of deterrence. 

71While I accept that sexual abuse was a motivating factor in the instant offence and should be regarded as operating in mitigation, I am not persuaded that the Prisoner's actions were not inspired by revenge. Furthermore, because of my view as to the Prisoner's credibility, I just do not know whether, as he alleges, he was actually hearing voices telling him to kill the deceased. 

72It was further submitted that as the prisoner's capacity to control himself and judge right from wrong was substantially impaired by his mental illness, the objective seriousness of the offence and the weight to be given to the principles of personal and general deterrence were reduced. Reference was made to R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [60] - [61] and R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36] where, summarising the effect of mental illness, Sperling J observed that it might be relevant in four ways:- 

33 First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced: Henry at [254]; Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23]; Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [51]; Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]; Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]. 

34 Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration: Pearce (NSW CCA, 1 November 1996, unreported); Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ; Letteri (NSW CCA, 18 March 1992, unreported); Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]. 

35 Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: Tsiaras at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]. 

36 A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence; Israil at [24]. 

73I accept the proposition at the beginning of the immediately preceding paragraph. I also accept all of these propositions of Sperling J. I accept also that, pursuant to the first, the punishment otherwise appropriate should be reduced, and that pursuant to the second, the weight to be given to general deterrence should be moderated. Although there are pluses and minuses, I am not persuaded that a custodial sentence weighs more heavily in this case. For reasons referred to below, I think special deterrence is of importance in this case. 

74However, there are other considerations. As the Crown submitted, recognition has already been afforded to the Prisoner's mental illness and his capacity to control himself and judge right from wrong in the jury's decision to convict him of manslaughter rather than murder. Any mitigation of his sentence further on account of these matters runs the risk of double counting. To some degree similar, considerations apply to the first two of the propositions of Sperling J. 

75In summary, the Prisoner committed an offence which, even characterised as manslaughter, was objectively serious. Causative factors included the fact that the Prisoner had been sexually abused, the Prisoner's anger resulting from dissension in his parents' household and the Prisoner's abnormality of mind. Of these three, the latter was in my judgment, by far the most significant. 

76There are a number of other matters to which regard must be had. Putting aside the issues of sexual abuse and substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, by a combination of pre-trial and admissions made during the trial, the Prisoner made complete pre-trial disclosure of his offence. The issue of substantial impairment was resolved in his favour and so has been the issue of sexual abuse although, in respect of this latter topic, in light of my conclusions, only to a limited degree. Section 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that a Court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose having regard to the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated by the defence albeit the lesser penalty must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. The Prisoner is entitled to some reduction in consequence of the application of this section. 

77Section 21A of the Act just mentioned lists a large number of aggravating and mitigating circumstances to which, if they are present, the Court is also required to have regard. It is not necessary that I list the significant number of aggravating circumstances here. They are reflected in what I have said above. I should however refer to some of the mitigating factors mentioned in the section. Although I have concluded that sexual abuse was a factor that played a part in the Prisoner's offending, I do not regard paragraph 3(c), which refers to the offender being ""provoked"", as having any relevance. The Prisoner has no prior criminal convictions, although in light of his evidence of breaking, entering and stealing, I do not regard him as of previous good character. I accept that the Prisoner has shown remorse. On the issues of the Prisoner's prospects of re-offending and rehabilitation, it is necessary to refer to further evidence. 

78Admitted into evidence during the sentencing proceedings was an affidavit showing that the Prisoner was presently engaged in Year 11 studies for the Higher School Certificate 

79There was also a report from Dr Joanne Shannon who has been the Prisoner's treating psychiatrist since November 2010. It is not practicable to incorporate in these reasons all of the observations in that very detailed report, but matters which may be noted include the following:- 

The Prisoner has always shown a high degree of respect for staff and other patients. While occasionally expressing anger, he has refrained from reacting in an aggressive manner. 

He has demonstrated self-discipline in maintaining his studies and motivation to maintain his physical health by exercise and diet. He has interacted well with other patients and is liked and respected by them. 

He has expressed remorse for the killing of the deceased, saying that he regretted his actions and that what he did was ""inhumane"". He denied any longer feeling any anger towards the deceased and denied any thoughts of violence to others. 

There is no evidence of either depressed or elevated mood. There is no formal thought disorder. The Prisoner denied any recent perceptual disturbances and demonstrated good insight into his mental health diagnosis and ongoing need for treatment. He was motivated to abstain from alcohol and other drugs. 

It is not possible to predict future violent behaviour. While several positive factors, eg, the absence of psychopathy, personality disorder or prior supervision failures, good response to treatment and absence of violent behaviour throughout the period of hospitalisation, exist, the prisoner has also a number of historical risk factors for violence. Considered together, these factors would suggest that there remains an elevated risk of violence compared to other men of his age in the general population. 

The prisoner suffers from bipolar disorder, which is a serious mental illness, although he has responded well to treatment and his mood is currently stable. 

The prisoner's risks to others and himself would be likely to increase in the context of exacerbation of his bipolar disorder which could occur as a result of severe psychosocial stressors or non-compliance with his management plan. His risk would also increase if he were to relapse into drug and alcohol abuse. That risk would also increase when the prisoner is returned to a custodial setting and on his release from custody, occasions when there will be a reduction in support. 

The prisoner will experience exacerbations of his bipolar disorder which may be precipitated by stressful life events or which may occur without obvious triggers. At such times, he will require review of his medications and may require hospitalisation. He has good insight into his mental illness, is aware of the need for long-term psychiatric support and wants to continue his medications. Prior to his release from custody, it will be essential that he is referred to a community mental health service. 

He requires long-term trauma counselling to help him deal with the long-term effects of sexual abuse and domestic violence. He would benefit from formal drug and alcohol counselling so that he can identify triggers that may lead him to relapse and learn adaptive coping skills. 

80Most of the first three indented paragraphs do indicate that the Prisoner is far more settled than he was prior to his offence and that augurs well for his future. Though undoubtedly the evidence indicates that the Prisoner did indulge in alcohol use at a far younger age than he should have, as I have said, I am unable to come to any concluded view as to the extent of this. However, the evidence does indicate that drugs were a significant problem and despite some positive indications in this regard there is nothing in this report, nor any other evidence in the case, that enables me to have any great confidence that the Prisoner will not return to some drug use. On the other hand, logic would suggest that the experience of his current incarceration should operate as a disincentive from conduct that increases his risk of recidivist behaviour and that that incarceration should be long enough to provide some assurance that it does. 

81The Prisoner is also entitled to have taken into account the fact that, apart from the attack on the deceased, he has no history of violence. In the result, while I am not disposed to find that the Prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending are as high as good, I accept that they are at least reasonable and perhaps better than reasonable. 

82Against those findings, I turn then to the question of what sentence should be imposed. 

83Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 sets out the purposes for which a Court may impose a sentence on an offender. Having regard to the degree of repetition and, to some degree, generality in which some of the sub-paragraphs of that section are expressed, the statement in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 is clearer:- 

The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. 

84Long-standing authority indicates that deterrence of others is of less weight in the case of an offender whose offending has been committed in consequence of some mental illness. Deterrence of the Prisoner is of significance in this case but when one has regard to the fact that, apart from the offence for which he is to be sentenced, he has no history of violence and the subject offence was largely inspired by his state of mind and some abuse to which he had been subjected, again and subject to the remarks I have previously made on the topic and those in the following paragraph, I do not think that personal deterrence looms large in the sentencing consideration. The one reservation concerns the use of drugs. 

85Experience in the Courts makes it clear that illegal drugs are a substantial contributor to irrational and criminal behaviour, particularly in the case of those who have certain congenital mental abnormalities. While it may be reasonably anticipated that the Prisoner will, while incarcerated, have brought home to him such dangers, it is appropriate to fix a sentence likely to deter him from resuming his use of such drugs. 

86Veen v The Queen (No 2) makes clear that there are limits to the operation which can be given to incarceration for the purposes of protecting society. In any event, it seems to me that, in the circumstances of this case, the protection of society is largely bound up in the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. 

87The evidence of the Prisoner's pursuit of education and the report of Dr Shannon make clear that reform, or rehabilitation, of the Prisoner has been and will continue to be addressed at least so long as he remains in a forensic hospital or juvenile justice centre. There are no grounds for thinking that the Prisoner's rehabilitation is likely to be assisted by a sentence longer than I intend to impose. 

88The fifth of the considerations referred to by the High Court is retribution. This Court said in R v Gordon (unreported, NSWCCA, 7 February 1994):- 

Retribution, or the taking of vengeance for the injury which was done by the offender, is also an important aspect of sentencing: R v Goodridge (1952) 7 WN 42 at 43; R v Cuthbert (1967) 86 WN (Pt 1) 272 at 274; R v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594 at 598. Not only must the community be satisfied that the offender is given his just desserts, it is important as well that the victim, or those who are left behind, also feel that justice has been done. 

89Of course, that latter proposition may not be taken too far. There are those who, in their loss, feel that the law should still demand an eye for an eye or a life for a life but the law has long since abandoned those extremes. 

90There is no clear tariff for manslaughter offences, particularly those committed under the influence of an abnormality of mind. It is implicit in the expressions ""substantially impaired"" and ""impairment ... so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter"" that there will be variations of degree. Some impairment may be gross, some may only just fall within the description of ""substantial"" so as to warrant the reduction. The Prisoner's history demonstrates that his abnormality of mind was, by no means, at the bottom of the scale. There are, of course, also the other factors to which I have referred to be taken into account. 

91Counsel for the Prisoner submitted that I should make a finding of special circumstances upon a number of grounds. I regard the fact that the Prisoner is serving his first period of incarceration and the desirability of him being subjected to a longer than usual period of supervision in respect of his mental condition and potential to relapse into drug use as ground for the finding sought. I am also satisfied that, within the terms of s 19(1A) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 there are special circumstances justifying detention of the Prisoner as a juvenile offender. Those special circumstances are that:- 

(a) The Prisoner is vulnerable on account of mental illness or disability; 

(b) the only available educational, vocational training for therapeutic programmes that are suitable for the Prisoner's needs are those available in detention centres, and 

(c) if the prisoner was committed to a correctional centre there would be an unacceptable risk of him suffering harm due to his youth and mental abnormality. 

92I base the conclusions set out in sub-paragraphs (a) - (c) upon the evidence in this case and knowledge, gained in this jurisdiction of the situation in correction centres generally. 

93Accordingly, in the circumstances of this case, it seems to me appropriate to sentence the Prisoner as follows:- 

I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 22 September 2008 together with a further period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 22 March 2013. 

I order that the whole of the said non-parole period be served as a juvenile offender. 

I record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Prisoner shall become eligible for parole, 22 March 2013.

		16 December 2011",2011-12-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708761,R v Masood Atai [2011] NSWSC 1617,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR : Masood Atai, you have been convicted of the murder of Ang Van Ly and stand for sentence for that offence. A co-accused was tried jointly with you and found not guilty of being an accessory after the fact to that murder. 

2The jury were invited to consider the charge as indicted on alternative bases of responsibility, namely, that you intended to kill or intended to cause grievous bodily harm or were recklessly indifferent to human life knowing that your actions would probably cause death. For the purpose of sentence, it is my task to make findings, not inconsistent with the verdict, of the facts and circumstances. 

3Both the crown prosecutor and your counsel have submitted that I should find that your criminal responsibility should be found to derive from recklessness as distinct from intentional killing or causing grievous bodily harm and I agree with these submission and proceed on my own finding to that effect. 

4Following arrangements communicated between them, a group of people including the prisoner assembled in a house in Merrylands. The house appears to have been used for meetings by members of the so-called Notorious Motorcycle Club. This circumstance was not explored at trial but there are a number of references to it in the material tendered on sentence. Ultimately, from the house and collected on the way, on the night of Tuesday 24 November 2009, a convoy of four vehicles became formed and was occupied by about fourteen people. The occupants have been described as representing various ethnicities, Afghani (including the prisoner), Islander, Lebanese and a young blonde woman. 

5The purpose of the expedition was not clearly defined but the cars eventually discharged the travellers near a park which was a short walking distance from a house in Fairfield in which the victim and other men were socialising. 

6Eventually, at about 11.00pm, the group, with the exception of the young woman, approached that house, some coming nearer to it than others. 

7I am satisfied that the prisoner and one other, one of the Islander men, came to the door and knocked while the remainder of the group stayed at a distance. 

8The door was answered and enquiry made for a name sounding like 'Johnny' or similar. The men socialising in the house were of Asian origin and some of them had limited fluency in English. It was effectively communicated that there was no one there such as would fit the enquiry and the prisoner and the Islander man commenced to withdraw. 

9As I have said, the purpose of the excursion by this large group late at night was not clear but, whatever it was, I would conclude that they had gone to the wrong house in seeking whoever or whatever it was they were seeking. The men in the house were of Cambodian and Vietnamese background and there is neither evidence, nor even suggestion, that any of them had any link with anyone in the group that had arrived in the convoy of four cars. 

10Having moved away from the front door, the prisoner stopped and produced a pistol. His companion continued his withdrawal from the scene. 

11There was sufficient lighting for the prisoner to discern the presence of people in the front room areas of the house and he discharged a number of shots towards the house. These totalled at least three and probably four shots. In firing the weapon in these circumstances, the prisoner foresaw that his action would probably result in killing one of the occupants of the house. 

12This is in the event what happened and Ang Van Ly, who was standing in a doorway near a front bedroom, was fatally struck in the head by one of the bullets discharged by the prisoner. 

13It scarcely needs to be said that the killing of a random victim by reckless discharge of a weapon such as a pistol with appreciation of that probable consequence is objectively very serious and, to the extent that scaling may be relevant, would place it above the mid-range of seriousness of such offences. 

14The prisoner and the rest of the group fled, in his case to the meeting house in Merrylands. Over ensuing weeks, police investigators conducted surveillance and authorised interception of telephone transmissions. 

15On 10 February 2010, the prisoner was arrested and charged with the murder of Ang Van Ly. He has been in custody since that date. 

16For the purpose of sentence I have reference to the statutory guideposts in the prescription of the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of twenty years. 

17As was his right, the prisoner neither gave evidence in the trial nor in the sentence hearing. An amount of documentary material was admitted by consent. A report by Ms Durkin, a psychologist who saw him last month, noted that he ""maintains his innocence"". Ms Kleinmeulman, a Probation and Parole officer who prepared a Pre-sentence report dated 2 nd instant, recorded ""The offender does not agree with the police facts. He stated that he was not guilty and that he was at home at the time of the offence"". 

18The prisoner was born on 3 February 1991 and was therefore aged eighteen when he committed the murder. As mentioned, he is of Afghani ethnicity but was in fact born in Iran. Not necessarily by choice, the family moved between Afghanistan and Iran until, with United Nations refugee arrangements, the family were relocated from the latter to Australia in 2005. His father had been killed in Afghanistan and the prisoner was one of eight children. The eldest two siblings were in Australia and in that year, the prisoner with his mother and the other five siblings also came. 

19I accept that the relocation to Australia required the prisoner and his family to struggle in settling here. He himself was required to learn English before engaging in mainstream schooling. 

20However, before leaving school after year 10 and aged seventeen, he had already been before the Children's Court for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug in March 2008, assaulting and resisting a female police officer in May 2008 and again supplying a prohibited drug later in the same month. It is convenient to note at this point that, after his arrest on the current charge, he was sentenced to imprisonment for three months and to pay compensation of $5,935 for an offence of damaging property, the custody to run from the date of his arrest and refusal of bail on 10 February 2010. 

21It does not appear that the prisoner had regular employment after leaving school but he engaged in casual labouring work from time to time. 

22From about the age of sixteen the prisoner commenced to associate with members of the Notorious Motorcycle Club, frequently referred to as an outlaw gang. He told Ms Durkin that he had attempted to extricate himself from that association and I accept that he took steps to remove an identifying tattoo to that end. Nevertheless, on the occasion of this offence, he both departed from and returned to what was apparently the Club's meeting house in Merrylands. Ms Durkin reported that, struggling emotionally to cope with his arrival in this new country, he connected with a peer group much older than himself, that is the motorcycle club, where members were of similar cultural background and spoke the same language. 

23The Pre-sentence report notes that when entered into custody he was classified as a high risk inmate due to an alert, quote, ""Notorious Outlaw Motorcycle Associate"". 

24The principal thrust of submissions on behalf of the prisoner was directed to the continuing family support from which it was sought to derive a finding that there would be a good prospect of rehabilitation. Ms Durkin's report dilates upon this at length and I will not pause to repeat what she has opined. Realistically, she noted that the prisoner was likely to receive a long custodial sentence and the treatment which she suggests can be engaged in long term. 

25On the information available I am unable to reach either a positive or negative conclusion concerning a prediction of the prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation. 

26I accept that the family are genuine in their desire to support him. On this basis, over objection, I admitted material concerning his mother's situation not, as counsel accepted, to demonstrate adverse effect on her which could be classified as exceptional, but to fortify the claim that there were good prospects of rehabilitation. He has in custody received regular family visits. 

27Against that submission, is the rejection by the prisoner of his responsibility for the crime of which he has been convicted. Acceptance of such responsibility is often said to be an initial step towards actual rehabilitation. 

28The prisoner's custodial record to date is not promising. There are seven entries between 20 December 2010 and the most recent on 20 November 2011. I recognise that it may take time to adjust to discipline and while four instances of unlawfully using phone or fax and smoking in a non smoking area may be of minor significance, two entries of intimidation of corrective staff and one of assault are more disturbing. 

29As I have said, balancing the material pointing either way, I am unable to make a positive or negative prediction of likely rehabilitation. 

30A specific submission was made that I should take into account as a mitigating factor that the prisoner has been, the inference being that he is likely to be in future, kept in more onerous conditions of segregation. 

31The Pre-sentence report states that he was placed in segregation as a result of an altercation with another inmate. In a discussion with Ms Durkin the prisoner acknowledged this but said this did not explain his long initial period in segregation. From the documents I would infer that a causative contribution would be an administrative decision to separate various perceived members of different motorcycle gangs. 

32On the history, it would seem probable that from time to time the prisoner will be placed in segregation. Sometimes, I apprehend, as a result of his own conduct, sometimes, for administrative reasons. To reflect the latter I would include an element of mitigation in my assessment but in the whole of the circumstances this will not be large. 

33A written submission contended that delay between commission of offence and sentence is relevant. I perceive that the lapse of time between charge and trial was within reasonable and normal limits. I reject the contention that, and I quote, "" he has the sustained pressure of having a sentence hanging over his head for a considerable period of time"". Sentence became an issue only after the verdict of guilty after trial and the adjournment since then was at the request of his representatives in order to acquire the psychological report and similar. 

34As it was expressly put that a Court is not permitted to penalise an offender for pleading not guilty, I record my acceptance of that principle and my intention not to breach it. 

35It was submitted that the prisoner was unlikely to re-offend. Obviously, I do not advert to the specific offence of murder and I note Ms Durkin's psychological profile of moderate risk category. Whether the prisoner is likely to re-offend is intrinsically bound up with the overall notion of rehabilitation and I will not repeat what I have said in that regard. 

36The most cogent element of mitigation that I consider can be applied to sentence assessment is the youth of the prisoner at the time of offending. I accept that his conduct reflected, to say the least, a considerable immaturity. The same might be said about his conduct since being committed to custody. 

37Counsel have referred me to a number of instances of sentences for murder imposed upon offenders of approximately similar ages. These remarks are not the occasion for the recitation of precedents and it suffices to say that I have looked at them, together with the statutory prescriptions abovementioned, for guidance. 

38In looking at the cases referred to by counsel and gauging any assistance to be derived from them, it has been necessary to bear in mind that some sentences took account of pleas of guilty and some reflected murder having been committed on an intentional basis. I repeat that I make an assessment on the basis of reckless indifference to human life which carries the essential element of the foresight of the probability of killing. 

39It will be necessary to set a non-parole period which will represent the minimum custody before eligibility of consideration for parole. I accept that the youth of the prisoner is relevant, in his favour, both for setting that non-parole period and assessing the total sentence. That said, and observing that in the case of sentence for murder application of the statutory formula for setting non-parole and balance terms will inevitably create a very long non-parole period, more than adequate for supervision if released to parole, I am unpersuaded that in this instance, youth or any other circumstance, leads me to find special circumstances whereby a reduced ratio between the ingredients of term should be applied. 

40This was a senseless crime whereby the life of an innocent stranger was taken. Although only two persons made direct approach to the house in which the victim was present, the prisoner came armed with a lethal weapon in the company of many others. Whether more than one person was aware that the prisoner was so armed I do not know, but there is no evidence that anyone anticipated that the prisoner would discharge the pistol as he did. He was the sole perpetrator of a violent and brutal act which he knew would probably have fatal consequences. 

41The rejection of responsibility evident in the prisoner's statements to Ms Durkin and Ms Kleinmeulman demonstrates an absence of remorse for the commission of the murder. Presence of relevant remorse is not to be derived from a remark to Ms Durkin of sorrow that the victim died. 

42I have referred to the service of three months imprisonment concurrently with custody awaiting trial and there is contest between counsel as to whether the commencement date of sentence should be deferred to take that into account. Ordinarily that should be done but, to the extent that discretion should be exercised, I have regard to the enormity of the seriousness of the crime of murder and the consequentially necessarily long sentence, and propose to commence sentence on the date that the prisoner was taken into custody on the instant charge. 

43Masood Atai, for the murder of Ang Van Ly you are sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of eighteen years commencing on 10 February 2010 and expiring on 9 February 2028 with a balance of term of six years commencing on 10 February 2028. 

44The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 9 February 2028.

2708766,Fierravanti-Wells v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2011] NSWDC 201,"Judgment 

1The defendants bring an application before me today to amend the defence to replace a plea of contextual truth with a plea of truth at common law. The imputation is pleaded in the following terms: 

""6A. In further and alternative answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim, the Defendants say that the matter complained of was true in substance and in fact in the following meaning: 

(a) The Plaintiff's study trip was an example of the kind of dubious study trips that prompted Special Minister of State, Joe Ludwig, to launch a complete review of the entitlements system and the possible scrapping of study trips, 

which is not different in substance from the imputation pleaded in paragraph 3(j) of the Statement of Claim."" 

2The plaintiff opposes the application, submitting that the application is brought late, the plea is defective and no additional particulars of truth have been provided. The plaintiff also submits that the common law of Australia does not recognise a ""nuance"" or ""shades of meaning"" defence of the kind pleaded by the defendants. 

3The defendants' previous defence pleaded a defence of justification and contextual truth (ss 25 and 26 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) ) to the plaintiff's imputations. The particulars relied upon, including the additional material for the new imputation (which is underlined), are as follows: 

"" Particulars of truth (UCPR 12.2(1)(c)) 

(a) The Plaintiff is an Australian born woman of Italian heritage, her parents having immigrated from Italy in the 1950s. 

(b) The Plaintiff has a family property in Umbria, Italy. 

(c) The Plaintiff has served as:

(ii) Nominee Sydney organising committee Olympic games multicultural advisory committee 1996-2000. 

(iii) The Plaintiff was awarded the Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1998. 

(d) The Plaintiff is a Senator for New South Wales in the parliament of Australia. The Plaintiff has served in the parliamentary position of temporary chair of committees from 26 June 2008 to 19 September 2008.

(iii) References Committee from 6 September 2005 to 11 September 2006. 

(iv) Finance and Public Administration from 11 September 2006 to 24 November 2008. 

(v) Community Affairs from 12 September 2006 to 9 May 2007. 

(vi) The Senate Select: Fuel and Energy from 26 June 2008 to 12 November 2008. 

(vii) The Joint Statutory: Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity from 23 March 2007 to 15 October 2008 and from 12 May 2010 to date. 

(viii) The Joint Standing: Electoral Matters from 26 February 2007 to 11 March 2008. 

(ix) Migration from 4 February 2009 to 22 June 2009. 

(f) The Plaintiff holds the following parliamentary party positions: 

(i) Shadow parliamentary secretary for immigration from 22 September 2008 to 8 December 2009 and Citizenship from 10 November 2008 to 8 December 2009, the shadow parliamentary secretary assisting the leader in the senate from 22 September 2008 to 8 December 2009. 

(ii) Member of the opposition shadow ministry from 8 December 2009. 

(iii) Shadow minister for the ageing from 8 December 2009. 

(g) As a Federal parliamentarian with over three years' service in parliament the Plaintiff is entitled to travel overseas for the purpose of undertaking studies or investigations of matters related to her duties and responsibilities as a member of parliament, with reimbursement of accommodation and subsistence costs actually incurred. 

(h) From 18 to 29 January 2009 the Plaintiff undertook a trip to Italy, including a stay at her family property in Umbria . 

(i) Within 30 days upon return from the overseas journey the Plaintiff was required to report to the Special Minister of State in writing within 30 days of return from the study trip, reporting: 

(i) confirmation of the purpose or the purposes of the journey and the itinerary, including any changes to the purpose or purposes and itinerary; 

(ii) key meetings and the main findings or outcomes, and 

(iii) conclusions drawn relating to the relevance of the tour to the Plaintiff's parliamentary responsibilities (the return report requirement ). 

(j) On 29 October 2009 the Plaintiff sought leave to table a document in the Senate which she described as a study leave report entitled ""From the farm to the wardrobe... A snapshot of the Australian wool industry"" dated August 2009 (the wool report ). 

(k) The wool report did not comply with the return report requirement in that it did not report in relation to: 

(i) the purpose or the purposes of the journey and the itinerary, including any changes to the purpose or purposes and itinerary; 

(ii) key meetings and the main findings or outcomes, and 

(iii) conclusions drawn relating to the relevance of the tour to the Plaintiff's parliamentary responsibilities. 

(l) The Plaintiff stated in the wool report that the impetus for her to conduct the research reflected in the wool report was that: 

(i) she wondered why Australia produces the best wool in the world, yet sells it to the Italians and then buys suits back; 

(ii) she had a particular interest in Australian-Italian relations, given her background; 

(iii) she understood the wool industry to be 'integral' to the relationship between Australia and Italy. 

(l1) Notwithstanding the length of the wool report, it contains only one chapter in relation to the Italian wool industry, namely Chapter 7. 

(l2) The source material for Chapter 7 of the wool report comprises: 

(i) material available in Australia; and 

(ii) observations and anecdotal material of little substance. 

(m) The wool report could have been prepared without the Plaintiff undertaking travel to Italy, without a materially adverse impact on the quality or content of the report. 

(m1) The conclusions in the wool report drawn from that material did not address the stated objectives in the wool report. 

(n) The wool report did not materially improve the body of literature on the relationship between Australian and Italian wool industry participants."" 

4The imputations pleaded by the plaintiff in the Further Amended Statement of Claim, to which the defence of justification is already pleaded, are as follows: 

""(a) The Plaintiff wasted taxpayers money (paragraphs 19-25 of the matter complained of). 

... 

(g) The Plaintiff went on a dubious study trip (paragraphs 19-15 of the matter complained of). 

... 

(i) The Plaintiff abused her entitlement to have an overseas trip by spending more than $17,000 for a study trip to Italy, because the reason she went there as [sic - ""was""] not to study, but to reconnect with her heritage (paragraphs 19-25 of the matter complained of). 

(j) The Plaintiff's abuse of her overseas study trip was one of three examples of dubious study trips that lead [sic - ""led""] to Special Minister of State Joe Ludwig launching a complete review of the entitlements system and the possible scrapping of study trips (paragraphs 19-27 of the matter complained of)."" 

5I shall deal first with the complaint of lateness in bringing the application. 

The circumstances in which this application is made 

6The defendants maintain their defence of justification under s 25, but must now withdraw a defence of contextual truth (which ""pleaded back"" the plaintiff's imputations) under s 26 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), following the Court of Appeal's decision in Besser v Kermode [2011] NSWCA 174, handed down on 30 June 2011. 

7The affidavit of Mr Lynch sets out his explanation for this late amendment as arising from the determination of two appeals, one of which was Besser v Kermode , and the other of which related to the mode of trial in these proceedings ( Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd v Fierravanti-Wells [2011] NSWCA 246). When the proceedings were relisted, they were given a hearing date almost immediately (namely 27 February 2012 as a 5-day jury trial). Mr Lynch then forwarded a copy of the proposed Amended Defence to the solicitors for the plaintiff on 25 November 2011. Due to a change of personnel in the plaintiff's solicitors' office, this letter was overlooked by the plaintiff until these proceedings were listed on 8 December 2011 by myself, for appropriate directions concerning the jury questions, after I was allocated this trial for hearing. 

8The defendants' prior defence (containing pleas under ss 25 and 26) was filed on 10 June 2010. On 1 July 2010, the defendants were ordered to file submissions as to why the Court should not order that the proceedings be tried by a jury. An appeal from the judgment of Levy SC DCJ dated 9 July was allowed on 24 August 2011. In the interim, the Court of Appeal handed down Besser v Kermode [2011] NSWCA 174 on 30 June 2011; the defendant's plea of contextual truth to the plaintiff's imputations was no longer available as a result of this decision. The combined impact of these two appeals caused what Mr Sibtain called a ""hiatus"" in case management. 

9An additional problem for the defendants was that prior to this hiatus, they had issued a subpoena (28 July 2010) to Senator Ludwig for certain documents. Mr Sibtain advised that when the hiatus period ended, and preparation for trial began, it was necessary to press for production of further documents, following which a second subpoena was served on 25 November 2011. 

10In addition, according to the affidavit of Mr Lynch, the parties advised the court on 20 September 2011 that they would be seeking a 10-day hearing in July 2012, to allow time for preparation for hearing. However, on 2 November, the parties were given a hearing date of 27 February 2012, by reason of the Court of Appeal costs order, which the defendants sought to enforce against the plaintiff. This meant that all preparation for hearing needed to be completed in a much shorter timeframe than that contemplated by either party. 

11The proposed amendments do not add a new defence, nor are they likely to cause the trial date to be vacated (cf Fierravanti-Wells v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 1338). 

12I am satisfied that the defendants have a satisfactory explanation for not bringing the application to amend prior to 25 November 2011. The parties to this litigation have been caught up in issues of considerable legal difficulty, in circumstances in which neither is to blame, and this has overshadowed case management of these proceedings. 

The plaintiff's submissions 

13The plaintiff's reasons for opposing leave to amend, set out in a brief outline provided to the court, are: 

(1) The proposed new imputation does not allege any act or condition by the plaintiff and is therefore not capable of being defamatory of her; the sting of the imputation is aimed at the study trip, not the plaintiff. 

(2) There are no particulars of truth to support the proposed new imputation. 

(3) The plaintiff's imputation (j) refers to the study trip being ""one of three examples of dubious study trips"" whereas the imputation proposed by the defendants refers only to ""study trips"" without limiting their number. In addition, the proposed new imputation is virtually identical to imputation (h) which has been previously struck out (albeit by reason of the vagueness of the term ""contributed to""). It is submitted that the new imputation, which substitutes the words ""prompted"" to replace ""contributed to"", does not cure this defect. The new imputation also fails to be conveyed in that it still suggests the plaintiff's study trip was one of the causes of the review. 

(4) The plaintiff also raised an estoppel argument on the basis that an imputation to the same effect pleaded by the plaintiff was struck out (for reasons related to its form). 

(5) The plaintiff additionally states: ""As a general submission the Plaintiff says that the common law of Australia does not recognise a nuance or shades of meaning defence. It follows that the Defendants' so called Common Law Truth imputation should not be recognised."" 
The first four objections relate to the form, capacity and particulars for the imputation; the fifth objection, which challenges whether the plea can be raised at all, needs to be dealt with first. 

Defences of justification and partial justification prior the enactment of uniform legislation 

14Prior to the enactment of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), there was powerful authority in support of the plaintiff's contentions. The New South Wales Court of Appeal held in Fairfax Publications v Zunter [2006] NSWCA 227 ("" Zunter "") that the ""Polly Peck""( Polly Peck (Holdings) plc v Trelford [1986] QB 1000 CA) defence and its variants were not recognised by the common law of Australia. 

15Handley JA went further, stating that a Polly Peck defence was not recognized ""at the present time"" by the common law in Australia (at [41] - [42], citing Chakravarti v Advertiser Newspapers Ltd (1988) 193 CLR 519 at 526-30): 

""[41] The appellant pleaded a defence in respect of publications in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory that was sanctioned by Polly Peck (Holdings) plc v Trelford [1986] QB 1000 CA. It was based on a single imputation that ""the plaintiff carried out an illegal backburn in circumstances of extreme fire danger"". The defence alleged that this was not separate and distinct from the plaintiff's imputations and was true in substance and fact. 

[42] There must be a real doubt as to whether that imputation could answer either of those pleaded by the plaintiff because it is comprised within them and is narrower. However there is no need to consider this defence in detail because at the present time the common law of Australia ( John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson (2000) 203 CLR 503, 514) does not recognise it. It was rejected in Chakravarti v Advertiser Newspapers Ltd (1998) 193 CLR 519, 526-30 by Brennan CJ and McHugh J, in dicta which did not receive the express endorsement of the other members of the Court. However those dicta have been followed by intermediate appellate courts in Victoria ( David Syme& Co Ltd v Hore-Lacy [2000] 1 VR 654), Queensland ( Robinson v Laws [2003] 1 Qd R 81), Western Australia ( Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Moodie (2003) 28 WAR 314), and South Australia ( Advertiser-News Weekend Publishing Co Ltd v Manock (2005) 91 SASR 206). This Court should follow this line of authority and it would be inappropriate for us to re-examine the question. The Judge rightly rejected this defence."" 

16In Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 631 ("" Mahommed "") at [239], Kirby J held that, consistent with Zunter, such a defence was not available in New South Wales under the 1974 Act. The Court of Appeal noted, during the appeal from this decision, that a submission that Zunter was wrongly decided (put formally before Kirby J) was not argued: Channel Seven Pty Ltd v Mahommed [2010] NSWCA 335 at [74]. 

17This approach changed with the impact of the uniform defamation legislation. The reasons are explained by Professor Kenyon (""Perfecting Polly Peck: Defences of Truth and Opinion in Australian Defamation Law and Practice"", (2007) University of Sydney Law Review 651). These reasons include that, for trials conducted in New South Wales, if such a defence had been pleaded to publications in common law states and territories in Australia, the split-trial s 7A process in New South Wales under s 9, Defamation Act 1974 would mean that the trial judge determining defences would have to overrule the earlier jury determination as to what defamatory imputations were actually conveyed. Professor Kenyon considers (at 665) that ""it could have been better for the Court of Appeal [in Zunter ] simply to note that under the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) the defence was bound to the jury finding on meaning in relation to all states and territories"". 

18What Professor Kenyon is explaining is that the jury finding on meaning prevented the pleading of this defence in states and territories outside New South Wales (which may mean that s 7A, in preventing the pleading of this defence in other jurisdictions, operated ultra vires). However, this means that the judgment in Snedden v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 262, and the issues Mr Evatt say will be raised in the High Court leave to appeal application, have no bearing on the application in question. 

19The Court of Appeal's change of approach concerning the availability of this defence in common law jurisdictions can be seen in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Hitchcock ( 2007) 70 NSWLR 484. The Court held that a defendant seeking to justify under the common law may only plead an imputation by way of defence to the plaintiff's imputation if that imputation does not differ in substance from the pleaded imputation, and is one which the plaintiff would be permitted to put to the jury on the state of the imputations the plaintiff pleaded. The Court (at [233]) rejected a submission that decisions endorsing Hore-Lacy were plainly wrong and should not be followed. 

The availability of the defence under the common law and under the 2005 uniform legislation 

20The defence has now been extensively reviewed by McColl JA in Besser v Kermode [2011] NSWCA 174 at [46] - [59]. The condition imposed upon such a plea is that the meaning does not differ in substance from a meaning pleaded by the plaintiff and is one that is not more injurious than that pleaded by the plaintiff (at [59]). 

21This is also the case in other jurisdictions in Australia. A submission very similar to that made by Mr Evatt in these proceedings was made, unsuccessfully, to Kelly J in Forrest v Chlanda [2011] NTSC 67 . Kelly J, relying upon the analysis of Professor Kenyon in his helpful explanatory review of the law, rejected ([at 8]) the claim that a defendant could not, as a matter of law, plead and justify an alternative meaning to that pleaded by the plaintiff. 

22In JWH Group Pty Ltd v Buckeridge [2009] WASC 271 ("" JWH Group"" ), Le Miere J comprehensively reviews decisions dealing with the pleas (and noting Professor Kenyon's research) in relation to the defence. Although these proceedings relate to a publication dated 17 December 2003 (well before the uniform legislation), the principles discussed in these cases, not only before, but after the introduction of the uniform defamation legislation (such as Soultanov v Age Co Ltd [2009] VSC 145), are sufficiently similar for these cases to be discussed together. Le Miere J does not refer to Zunter or to Mahommed . 

Conclusions concerning the availability of the defence 

23Whatever may have been the position of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in the past, Besser v Kermode makes it clear beyond doubt that this defence is now available. This will no doubt include Queensland, although prior to the new legislation, this defence was not available there: Robinson v Laws [2003] 1 Qd R 81 at 92 - 95, 99 - 1-2 and 106 - 8). The change of the cause of action to ""matter"" ( Defamation Act 2005 (Qld) ss 4, 6 and 8) means that the availability of this defence is likely to be revisited in Queensland, conformably with the principles enunciated by McColl JA in Besser v Kermode. 

24I agree with the plaintiff's submission, however, that the position under the 1974 Act in New South Wales was that these defences were not (before Snedden ) available where proceedings were commenced in New South Wales under the 1974 Act, both for publications within the state as well as in the common law states and territories. As already noted, the split-trial s 7A process meant that the jury decided what imputations were conveyed; it would not be possible for a common sting or different meaning imputation to be raised at the trial of defences, because the judge would have to overrule the earlier jury finding as to what defamatory imputations were conveyed. This would deny the defendant the right to this defence in those common law jurisdictions. That is, however, no longer the case. 

25The plaintiff's submissions that the common law of Australia does not recognise a nuance or shades of meaning defence must fail. Such a defence has long been available in common law jurisdictions, and is now available under the uniform defamation legislation. 

26Before dealing with the remaining submissions of the plaintiff, I should briefly note the two different kinds of imputations likely to be pleaded in such a defence. 

Two different kinds of common law imputations 

27The first kind of imputation is one where the level or degree of seriousness of the plaintiff's imputation is challenged. Professor Kenyon calls this the ""Lucas-Box"" defence ( Lucas-Box v News Group Newspapers [1986] 1 WLR 147) and adds that, in England, Lucas-Box meanings are no longer limited to a difference of degree, such as guilt and suspicion, but now extend to any meaning capable of arising from the publication where the imputation does not concern a separate and distinct allegation of which the plaintiff does not complain. The defendants say that the proposed new imputation is an imputation of this kind, and is pleaded as such. 

28I shall, however, also note the second type of imputation identified by Professor Kenyon, namely that the multiple imputations pleaded by the plaintiff are not distinct but have a common sting, so that proving the truth of one aspect of the common sting will justify the entire publication. This second type of defence has, confusingly, been called ""the first Polly Peck proposition"" ( Woodger v Federal Capital Press (1997) 102 ACTR 1 at 23- 4), and also ""the second Polly Peck proposition"" ( John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Jones [2004] NSWCA 205 at [80]). 

29What both these forms of the defence have in common is their close relationship to the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff. They differ, in this regard, from contextual imputations, the nature of which I should also briefly outline. 

30A third type of imputation capable of being pleaded by a defendant is to be found in the contextual truth defence set out in the uniform Defamation Acts (see, for example, s 26 of the NSW Act). Contextual imputations arise in addition to and at the same time as the plaintiff's imputations, but have not been pleaded by the plaintiff ( Besser v Kermode [2011] NSWCA 174). The truth of the contextual imputations, when weighed against the falsity of one or more of the plaintiff's imputations, may amount to a complete defence. Since Besser v Kermode has restricted this defence to imputations not pleaded by the plaintiff, plaintiffs can now easily circumvent this defence by ""pleading back"" any contextual imputations identified by the defendant. However, the presence of s 26 does not deny the right of a defendant to plead what McColl JA calls ""nuance"" imputations; McColl JA at [58]-[59] notes the availability of the principles set out in David Syme & Co v Hore-Lacy [2000] VSCA 24 for defendants seeking to plead such a defence. 

31The next issue to determine is the plaintiff's alternative application to strike out the proposed new imputation for reasons of form and capacity, lack of particularisation, and estoppel. I note the principles on a strike out application as set out by Le Miere J in JWH Group Pty Ltd at [18] - [19] and the manner in which such applications have been approached by the cases referred to in this decision. 

The steps to take under the Hore-Lacy approach 

32The questions which arise are as follows: 

(a)Is the defence meaning capable of arising from the publication? The plaintiff in these proceedings challenges the capacity of the imputation to be conveyed. 

(b)Is the defence meaning not substantially different from, and not more injurious, than the plaintiff's imputation? As Professor Kenyon points out, this is the additional question added by Hore-Lacy. What amounts to ""not substantially different"" is discussed below. The plaintiff submits the proposed new imputation fails this test. 

(c)Alternatively, does the defence meaning arise from a separate and distinct allegation in the publication about which the plaintiff does not complain? This is a question which must be answered ""no"". If the imputation is a separate and distinct meaning about which the plaintiff does not complain, it is a contextual imputation (s 26) and should be pleaded as such. 

(d)Are there particulars capable of going to the truth of the defendant's imputation? The plaintiff challenges the adequacy of the particulars provided. 

(e)An additional feature referred to in many of the judgments is whether the issues raised by the defendant's imputation may result in the raising of false issues at the trial, or that the trial may be ""hijacked"" ( Newnham v Davis (No 2) [2010] VSC 94 at [18]). The scope of the evidence to be admitted is, however, an issue of case management rather than grounds for refusing to permit the pleading. 

Objections to form, capacity and defamatory meaning 

33The plaintiff's first two objections are that the imputation alleges no act or condition of or concerning the plaintiff, and that the sting of the imputation is aimed at the study trip, not the plaintiff. However, the conduct the subject of attack is the plaintiff's activity of taking a study trip which is ""dubious"". Mr Evatt withdrew objections to capacity during argument, as well as claims that the imputation was incapable of being a ""nuance"". 

34Although the objection to defamatory meaning was also not pressed, I note that the circumstances in which a member of parliament takes a study trip that is ""dubious"" is capable of being defamatory, as ""dubious"" has a pejorative overtone: Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd v Mahommed [2010] NSWCA 335 at [142] (""dubious mortgages""). 

Is the imputation one which is not more serious and otherwise not substantially different from the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff? 

35The plaintiff's attack on the Hore-Lacy requirement is limited; the plaintiff complains that imputation (j) is confined to one of three examples whereas the defendants' proposed new imputation refers to ""study trips"" without number. 

36The fact that three study trips provoked the review is, as the defendants point out, not the issue. The question is the quality of those study trips. The defendants' imputation embraces the connection between the dubious study trips and the review, but does not claim that the plaintiff's dubious study trip caused this review. As such, it is a nuance, shade or gradation of the plaintiff's imputation (j), omitting the element of being the cause of the inquiry. 

The estoppel argument 

37First, I note that the imputation pleaded by the plaintiff (imputation (h)) was struck out for ""form"" reasons, with leave to replead. The striking out of an imputation with leave to replead cannot give rise to estoppel, particularly where, even if that occurred, the vice leading to the striking out of the imputation has been cured by the use of more precise language. I note the plaintiff did in fact replead imputation (h) (it is now imputation (j)), but does not suggest that imputation (j) and the proposed new imputation of the defendants do not differ in substance. 

38Secondly, and more importantly, the proposed new imputation differs from the imputation pleaded by the plaintiff that was struck out. The defendants' new imputation refers to the plaintiff's study trip as having a dubious character, but does not suggest that this led to the review by the Special Minister of State. It has the same character as those other dubious study trips, but is not asserted to be the cause. 

Are there particulars to support the imputation? 

39As can be seen from the particulars of justification already provided, the defendants have set out additional particulars for their existing plea of justification (see (h), (l)(i), (l1), (l2) and (m1)). 

40During the hearing before me this morning the plaintiffs raised objections to the lack of connection between these particulars and the new pleading. I have made orders for the provision of further particulars which Mr Evatt says will substantially resolve the problem. 

41The objections raised by the plaintiff to the form, capacity, defamatory meaning and particulars to the defendants' imputation are rejected. The defendants are granted leave to file the amended pleading. 

Additional matters 

42When these proceedings were first before me for directions, Mr Evatt referred to potential difficulties at trial caused by a defence of this kind. 

43Professor Kenyon's research project, the results of which are set out at pages 670 -673 of his article, shows that according to court statistics and interviews with practitioners in jurisdictions where this defence is used, trials have been run more efficiently, with fewer interlocutory proceedings, speedier hearing times and no increase in the time length of trials. 

44Additional complexity or length of trial as a result of any amendment would be a matter for concern, particularly given the tight timetable and limited hearing length given to this trial by the court prior to its allocation to me as trial judge. The provision of additional particulars, and the experience and seniority of counsel on both sides, should ensure that this amendment to the pleadings will cause no additional delay or confusion. 

45Two matters remain outstanding. The first is the issue of jury questions. There is one issue concerning the interaction between this defence and determination of the capacity of the plaintiff's imputations to which the plaintiff's submissions concerning Snedden may have relevance. A ""jury question"" issue for determination in defamation trials is whether the jury should retire early to consider issues concerning the plaintiff's imputations: Davis v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 699. That may not be advisable in cases where a plea of justification at common law is made, for the reasons explained by Professor Kenyon in relation to the interaction of this defence with early determination of the meanings pleaded by the plaintiff. The parties tell me they do not propose to use this procedure in the trial. 

46The second outstanding issue is the question of costs of this application. The defendants ask the court for an indulgence in the form of an amended pleading, and the costs thrown away by reason of the amendment would ordinarily be borne by them. In addition, the plaintiff's submissions that more particulars are required for this new pleading, which took up a substantial part of the hearing time, were well-founded. I have set a timetable for submissions and relisted the matter for 23 December for the purpose of giving judgment on this issue. 

Orders 

(1) The defendants provide further and better particulars by 4.00pm Friday 16 December 2011 of the following: 

(a) Further and better particulars of paragraphs (l2) and (m1) to include facts and matters relied upon in support of the assertion in the proposed new imputation that the plaintiff's study trip was an example of the kind of ""dubious"" study trips that prompted Senator Joe Ludwig's enquiry, identifying those study trips and stating how the plaintiff's study trip was an example comparable to them; 
(b) Further and better particulars for the material in (l2) asserted to be available in Australia and the material ""of little substance""; and 
(c) How the conclusions failed to address the stated objectives in paragraph (m1). 
(2) Grant the defendants leave to file an amended defence in accordance with the draft pleading attached to the affidavit of Kevin Lynch dated 9 December 2011. 
(3) The defendants to provide written submissions by 4.00pm Friday 16 December 2011 as to why the defendants should not pay the costs of this application. 
(4) Plaintiff's submissions on costs by 4.00pm Monday 19 December 2011. 
(5) Matter stood over for further directions to Friday 23 December 2011 at 10:00am. 
(6) The plaintiff answer any outstanding interrogatories (if any) by 4.00pm Thursday 22 December 2011 - (note interrogatories were administered on 25 November 2011).

		14 December 2011",2011-12-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708771,R v AH [2011] NSWSC 1535,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1JOHNSON J : The Offender, AH, appears for sentence for the crime of manslaughter. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years. 

2On 22 July 2011, the Offender was arraigned before Latham J upon an indictment alleging that, on 25 April 2009, at Busby in the State of New South Wales, he did murder David Wayne Boyce. The Offender pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. 

3In passing sentence for the offence of manslaughter, the Offender asks the Court to take into account on sentence an offence of hindering the execution of a search warrant contrary to s.52 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 , for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for two years. 

4At the outset, I observe that the Offender is not to be sentenced for directly causing the death of Mr Boyce. It is not alleged that the Offender wielded the knife which caused the fatal injury to Mr Boyce. Rather, the Offender's crime arises from his participation in events in the early hours of 25 April 2009 which saw two groups of young men coming into conflict, involving the use of violence, and with a person on the Offender's side of the conflict stabbing Mr Boyce to death. I will return to the nature of the Offender's crime, and its seriousness, later in these remarks on sentence. 

5A sentencing hearing took place before me on 19 September 2011. 

Facts of Offence 

6A number of persons (including the Offender) are referred to by initials and not by their full names in these remarks on sentence. The tragic events surrounding the death of Mr Boyce involved persons who were under 18 years of age and who should not be identified: s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 . Where adult members of the family of young persons are mentioned, they will also be referred to by way of initials so as to avoid indirect identification of the young persons. 

7An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The Offender did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. The Agreed Statement of Facts revealed the following. 
 
Two Gatherings of Persons at Wentworthville and Busby 

8On the evening of Friday 24 April 2009, Mr Boyce (aged 23) was visiting a number of friends at a gathering at Wentworthville. The group were drinking alcohol and some were also consuming small amounts of methylamphetamine. 

9At the same time, another gathering of friends was taking place at a house at Trevanna Street, Busby. The premises were leased by the ""T"" family - Mrs T (56 years' old), her de facto husband (55 years' old) and their son JT (17 years' old). 

10JT had a number of friends (including JP) visiting him and they were drinking alcohol and socialising in the backyard. 

A Dispute Between Two Young Men, the Offender and JT 

11At around 12.30 am on Saturday 25 April 2009, a telephone call was made. RM (JP's girlfriend) was on the telephone and JT asked if she was talking to the Offender (then 16 years and eight months of age). There had been ill feeling between JT and the Offender over their respective relationships with a young woman, CH. JT and the Offender had an argument over the phone before the call ended. 

12The Offender was then in the company of his friend, Joey Smith (then 18 years and three months of age), Ms Danielle Fox and her friend Natalie Ryan (18 years of age). Mr Smith drove that group to the Offender's home. 

13The Offender got out of the car for a short time and went into the house. He returned carrying some metal poles. 

14The Offender put the metal poles on the floor of the car. 

The Offender Arrives at the Busby House and JT and the Offender Argue 

15The Offender telephoned RM, so she could notify JT that he was outside the Busby house. He asked JT to come outside. Both the Offender and Mr Smith were present. 

16The Offender and JT argued for a while. JP, a friend of JT, was carrying a metal pole hidden inside his pants. Mr Smith took the pole and said that he was going to throw it away, which he did. The metal pole was described as one metre in length. JP said it belonged to JT ""in case someone jumps in"" . 

17During this argument, JT's stepfather came outside and intervened. The Offender refused to leave unless JT apologised. JT's stepfather apologised on his stepson's behalf and shook hands with the Offender. 

The Offender and Mr Smith Depart 

18Mr Smith and the Offender left the area on foot and returned to the car with Ms Fox and Ms Ryan. They drove away. 

19Meanwhile at the Busby house, JP questioned JT as to why he allowed his stepfather to intervene and apologise for him. JT became angry at his stepfather for sending the Offender and Mr Smith away. 

20JT attempted to contact the Offender so that he (the Offender) would return to the area. He was unable to reach the Offender. RM telephoned Ms Fox. 

The Offender and JT Agree to Fight and Both Sides Call for Supporters 

21JT took the phone from RM and said "" Get [AH] on the phone"" . The Offender and JT agreed to meet again so that they could fight ""one on one"" . The Offender believed that JT was too drunk. The Offender originally suggested that they sort it out, by fighting one on one, the following day. 

22During a telephone call, JT said that he was told that Mr Smith was bringing ""more boys"" . JT called his friend, Mr Boyce, on several occasions, asking him to come to Trevanna Street. Mr Boyce agreed to come and he brought several friends with him. 

23The Offender, Mr Smith, Ms Fox and Ms Ryan travelled to AT's house. 

24Earlier that evening, Saad Jamie Barghachoun, AT and Luca Alviggi had been socialising and driving around together in a van. 

25AT received a phone call at some point, from either the Offender or Mr Smith, asking him and the people with him (Mr Alviggi and Mr Barghachoun) to meet Mr Smith, the Offender, Ms Fox and Ms Ryan at AT's house. 

26Meanwhile, Daniel Plesko (the cousin of AT), David Bosevski and Jason Hubbard arrived at AT's house in a separate car. 

27From AT's premises, a number of persons travelled in a large white van belonging to Mr Alviggi's father, towards the Busby house. They were AT, Ms Fox, Mr Smith, Mr Barghachoun, Jason Hubbard, Mr Plesko, Mr Alviggi, Mr Bosevski, Ms Ryan and the Offender. Prior to arriving at the Busby house, the group picked up Jesse Hubbard. 

28AT was driving the van, two other people were front-seat passengers and the rest were seated in the cargo section in the rear of the van. 

29Various metal poles were inside the van. There was discussion in the van between some of the males to the effect that they were going to the house for the purpose of a fight. 

30Several people heard the Offender say he was going to have a ""one on one"" fight with JT. 

31Mr Smith had possession of a knife in the van. The Crown made clear that it was no part of the Crown case that the Offender knew of the knife (T39.32, 19 September 2011). 

Arrival of the Two Groups at the Busby House 

32AT stopped the van around the corner on Kaluga Street, Busby. He remained with the van whilst others got out and commenced walking towards the Trevanna Street house. As they were walking, a number of the males, including the Offender, were carrying metal poles. The Offender was aware that some others in the group were also armed with metal poles. 

33As Ms Fox, Ms Ryan, the Offender, Mr Smith and Mr Barghachoun (and the other males) approached the house, two males - JT and JP - were on the veranda of the Busby house. They saw the group approaching and retreated inside the house. 

The Offender and JT Clash 

34The Offender was banging on the screen door of the Busby house with a pole yelling, ""come out [JT] "" . 

35He then turned away from the door and, as he did this, JT opened the door and approached the Offender from behind and hit him once to the back of the head with a wooden bat. 

36The impact caused the Offender to fall to the ground. He was still holding the metal pole at the time. JT retreated back into the house. 
 
The Two Groups Confront Each Other and Mr Boyce is Stabbed 

37At about the same time, Mr Boyce (and others) arrived in a 4WD vehicle. Before the driver had stopped the vehicle (directly in front of the house), Mr Boyce jumped out of the passenger seat, armed with a baseball bat, and approached several people in the group that had arrived in the van. Three other males (Emery Newton, Greg Phoenix and Josh Tyrell) and two females (Casey Tyrell and Renee Hosking) were also in the 4WD. 

38Soon after Mr Boyce had emerged from the 4WD, he became involved in an affray with persons who had come from the van. Mr Boyce was stabbed once to the chest by Mr Smith. The wound penetrated his heart causing death. Blood from Mr Boyce was later analysed. Alcohol was detected as 0.065g/100 mL of blood. Methylamphetamine was also detected as being less than 0.02 mg/L. 

39Mr Boyce was found lying apparently unconscious in the front yard of the Busby house. The person who called ""000"" was apparently not aware, when the call was made, that Mr Boyce had been stabbed. 

40Josh Tyrell, who had emerged from the 4WD, was struck to the head and the shins as he was trying to get inside the house. At one point during the affray, Mr Barghachoun struck Mr Tyrell in the shins with a baseball bat. Mr Tyrell was later treated at hospital for a cut to the side of his head, broken fingers on his right hand and stitches to his right shin. 

41Greg Phoenix, who also emerged from the 4WD, was struck to the head by one of the males who had emerged from the van. 

42Before leaving the area, Mr Smith smashed the front window of the Busby house. Mr Smith then used a pole to strike and damage a vehicle that was parked in the driveway of the house. 

The Offender and Others Flee the Scene 

43The Offender, Mr Smith, Mr Barghachoun and the other persons from the van quickly left the area and returned to the van. AT drove away from the area. 

44As the van was driving away, males inside the van were saying ""we showed them"" . The Offender said ""We wasted our time, [JT] didn't even come out"" . Mr Barghachoun said ""Which one was [JT] , everyone was hitting everyone, I was hitting people but who the hell was [JT] "" . Someone said that a person had been ""knocked out"" . 

45Mr Smith was heard to say ""I think I stabbed him ... fuck fuck fuck"" . Another person from the van said ""I can't believe you stabbed him"" . Mr Smith was asked by someone in the van ""Where did you stab him?"" . Mr Smith replied ""In the ribs, I had to protect my mate"" . Ms Ryan saw Mr Smith with the knife in the van. 

46The evidence is not clear regarding who was sitting where in the van in the journey to and from the Busby house. There were several conversations going on simultaneously, and there was music playing in the van. It is not clear exactly who said what, or what was heard by whom. Mr Smith is reported to have said about the knife that ""It has blood on it"" . He passed the knife to someone who wiped it clean with a tissue. 

Police and Ambulance Arrive at the Busby House 

47Police arrived at the Busby house shortly after the Offender and others had left. 

48Ambulance officers attended soon after (at about 3.18 am) and observed that Mr Boyce had sustained a stab wound to his chest. He was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital, where he was found to be in cardiac arrest and efforts to resuscitate him failed. He was pronounced dead at 4.03 am. 

Disposal of the Knife 

49The van eventually arrived back at AT's house where AT was handed the knife by Mr Smith. AT secreted it in a drain near his house. He has been sentenced in the Local Court for his role in getting rid of the knife. 

50Ms Fox and Ms Ryan walked out on to the street and waited by Mr Smith's car. When the Offender and Mr Smith came out, they all got in the car and drove to an industrial area nearby. They then drove to Mr Smith's house. 

51The Offender lay down in Mr Smith's house and fell asleep. Ms Fox received a call and was informed that someone had been stabbed and that the person was dead. Ms Fox told the Offender this news and he told Mr Smith. 

52Mr Smith began to create a false alibi. He said to Ms Fox ""We weren't there, we were at home watching movies. If you have to give a statement use that as an alibi"" . Ms Fox said ""Yeah lets stick with that story"" . 

53Later in the morning, Mr Smith drove Ms Ryan home. When she was dropped off, Ms Fox said ""Don't say anything"" . Mr Smith then drove Ms Fox home. 

Police Search the Offender's House and Arrest the Offender and Mr Smith 

54At around 7.40 pm on 25 April 2009, a number of police officers attended the Offender's home at Hoxton Park, armed with a lawful warrant to search the premises. Detective Grimes spoke to the Offender and his mother about the warrant. As his mother was reading the occupier's notice, the Offender said ""Fuck em, they're a bunch of dogs - they don't call them pigs for no reason"" . The search was video recorded. 

55As police officers continued to explain the warrant to his mother, the Offender received a telephone call on his mobile phone. He said to the person on the phone ""I just had fucken eight coppers barge in the door"" . The Offender's mother then said "" [AH] language"" . The Offender said ""Fuck em - says I can't obstruct a search warrant, doesn't say I can't call them pigs and fucken dogs"" . The Offender read out the items of interest listed on the warrant. He said to the person on the phone ""They're lookin for this to do with the murder this morning, I fucken been asleep, I fucken woke up now and banged the door"" . 

56Police commenced searching the Offender's bedroom. As they were searching, the Offender said to police ""Youse are a bunch of fucken retards"" . The Offender said ""Who was I supposed to have murdered anyway?"" . 

57Whilst police were searching the room, the Offender argued with police and swore at officers. The Offender demanded the return of a clear plastic bag that contained personal papers. The Offender said to the police ""Give me my fucken stuff back - what the fuck do you think this is?"" . The Offender's mother tried to calm him down. He replied ""I don't care - fuck yas"" . He then pushed past police and uttered further abuse as he pushed past Detective Grimes. 

58Detective Grimes took hold of the Offender's arm. His mother tried to calm him down once again. The Offender pulled away from police and said ""Get the fuck off me cunt"" . The Offender then walked past Detective Grimes and approached Detective Hatchwell, who was standing in a hallway and said ""You move too"" . Detective Grimes then placed the Offender under arrest. The Offender said ""Let me get my fucken shoes"" . 

59The Offender pulled away from Detective Grimes and tried to pushed past Detective Hatchwell. As he did this, Detective Hatchwell reminded him that he was under arrest and said ""Don't do anything stupid"" . The Offender replied ""Get out of my fucken way, it's my house I can go wherever I fucken want to go"" . The Offender then pushed Detective Hatchwell to the chest with both hands. Police then restrained the Offender on the floor. 

60As the Offender was being taken from the house, he yelled at police ""Let me go you fucken dog"" . The Offender continued to violently struggle with police and yell abuse at the officers. 

61The events recorded in [54]-[60] above are agreed facts for the purpose of the Form 1 offence to be taken into account on sentence. 

62Both the Offender and Mr Smith were arrested by police and each exercised his right to silence. 

63During the search of the Offender's house, police spoke with Mr Barghachoun. He asked officers why Mr Smith had been arrested. Police told him that Mr Smith was arrested in relation to a murder at Busby the previous evening. They asked Mr Barghachoun whether he knew anything about it. He replied ""That's the first I've heard about it. I went out with my mate Luca for a while and then he dropped me off at my place .... Around midnight"" . He said that earlier in the evening he saw Mr Smith ""but he didn't want to do nothing so I called my mate Luca"" . He told police that he would be prepared to make a statement to that effect. 

64On 26 April 2009, police spoke with AT. He showed police where he had secreted the knife. Police located a brown-handled knife in a leather sheath in a drain. It was later examined and DNA recovered from the side of the blade near the tip matched the profile of Mr Boyce. 
 
Progress of Charges Against the Offender 

65In February 2010, a charge of murder, on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise, was laid against both Mr Barghachoun and the Offender. 

66The Offender pleaded guilty to the affray charge in the Children's Court on 27 January 2011. That charge remained in the Children's Court and has been withdrawn. He was committed for trial for murder after committal proceedings. 

67As mentioned earlier, at arraignment in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 22 July 2011 and prior to any trial being listed, the Offender entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter in lieu of the murder charge. The Crown accepted the plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. 

68It was agreed at the sentencing hearing that the Offender spent 11 days in custody on this matter. As a result, any sentence of imprisonment will date from 2 December 2011. 

69As mentioned a short time ago, the Offender pleaded guilty to a charge of affray in the Children's Court, that charge has been withdrawn. Accordingly, the only sentencing decision to be made by any Court with respect to the Offender's involvement in the events of 24 and 25 April 2009 is the imposition of sentence in this Court for the crime of manslaughter. 

Seriousness of the Offence 

70The Offender has pleaded guilty to the crime of manslaughter. He is to be sentenced for his participation in an extended joint criminal enterprise, in that he took part in an unlawful and dangerous act, an affray, in circumstances which objectively carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury being occasioned to a person. 

71To assist in an assessment of the seriousness of the offence, it is helpful to identify the Offender's course of conduct. 

72The origin of the dispute which culminated in the death of Mr Boyce related to tension between the Offender and JT over their respective relationships with a young woman. What commenced as a telephone argument between the two young men in the early hours of 25 April 2009 moved towards physical confrontation, with the Offender (and his companions) travelling to JT's house at Busby after the Offender had collected some metal poles from his house. 

73A face-to-face argument between JT and the Offender took place outside the Busby house. The intervention of JT's stepfather cooled the situation leading to the departure of the Offender and his companions. 

74Regrettably and tragically, JT's friend, JP, appears to have challenged JT as to why he had allowed his stepfather to intervene and apologise on his behalf. JT's response was to, once again, become angry and to seek to contact the Offender to resume the face-to-face confrontation. 

75When the Offender heard of this, the only sensible course to take was to decline any suggestion of further confrontation. Instead, the Offender took up the challenge for a further confrontation, although apparently suggesting at one point it should occur the next day. Instead, it became clear that JT and the Offender would again confront each other physically that night. 

76The Offender travelled in a van with his supporters to the Busby house. He was aware that these persons were accompanying him to support him and that there were metal poles in the van capable of being used in the expected fight. 

77The Crown does not contend that the Offender was aware that Mr Smith had a knife in his possession in the van. 

78Having arrived near the Busby house, the Offender emerged from the van, accompanied by his companions. The Offender and others were carrying metal poles. 

79The Offender spotted JT on the veranda of the Busby house, with JT and JP going back inside the house as the group approached. The Offender walked up to the house and banged on the screen door, calling for JT to come out. JT emerged and approached the Offender from behind and hit him to the back of the head with a wooden bat. 

80During the course of the melee which followed, Mr Smith stabbed Mr Boyce. Blows were struck by other persons in the Offender's group, including Mr Barghachoun, to persons in JT's group. 

81Soon after, the Offender fled the scene with Mr Smith, Mr Barghachoun and others. 

82The following observations can be made concerning these matters which concern the role of the Offender in the crime: 

(a) it was the dispute between JT and the Offender which explained how the confrontation in the early hours of 25 April 2009 came to happen; 

(b) following a telephone argument with JT, the Offender escalated the dispute by travelling with his companions to the Busby house, having collected some metal poles on the way - it was the Offender who came to JT's house for this purpose, clearly prepared to engage in a physical confrontation; 

(c) the good sense and intervention of JT's stepfather defused the situation and the Offender left; 

(d) although it was JT (apparently egged on by JP) who reignited the dispute thereafter, the Offender and his companions were once again prepared to travel to JT's house for the purpose of a physical confrontation; 

(e) having arrived at JT's house a second time, the Offender was actively involved in approaching the premises and demanding that JT emerge, whilst the Offender was holding a metal pole which, was no doubt, he was prepared to use; 

(f) as it happens, JT emerged and struck the Offender over the head, with the blow effectively bringing to an end the involvement of the Offender in the physical confrontation; 

(g) by this time, however, the two groups of young men were engaged in a melee in the street and front yard, a process set in train by the dispute between the Offender and JT; 

(h) Mr Smith and Mr Boyce were only present at that time and place because of the dispute between the Offender and JT and, in that tragic context, Mr Smith stabbed and killed Mr Boyce; 

(i) although the Offender did not know that Mr Smith was armed with a knife, let alone that he would use it, it was objectively clear that there was an appreciable risk of serious injury being occasioned to a person as a result of the series of events set in train by the Offender that night. 

83I keep in mind that I am not sentencing the Offender for directly causing the death of Mr Boyce, nor am I sentencing him for his participation in a joint enterprise that had as its object the doing of an act with the intention of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm. 

84In this case, the persons at risk of serious injury were the persons involved in the affray itself. These were the persons who emerged from the Busby house with reinforcements from the 4WD (on one side) and the persons who emerged from the van, including the Offender and Mr Smith (on the other side). 

85The Offender travelled with a group of men, expecting that he would fight with JT and that his companions were prepared to assist in violence if need be, using metal poles. The Offender knew at least that JT was not alone at the Busby house and that JP was present, together with JT's stepfather who was entirely innocent in the process, and had attempted to responsibly calm the situation earlier in the evening. Yet, the Offender led the charge on the Busby house seeking to attack JT although, as it happens, it was JT who struck the Offender, apparently removing him from the action as a result. 

86The Offender was an instigator of the dispute which occurred that night, leading to physical confrontation. He was no passive bystander. He said that he was prepared to fight and he acted accordingly. 

87There is no evidence that the Offender engaged in any confrontation with Mr Boyce. The stabbing of Mr Boyce by Mr Smith was a tragic by-product of the events which the Offender had set in train that night. 

88In the course of sentencing a co-offender, Mr Barghachoun, earlier today, I referred to sentencing cases where the Supreme Court was called upon to sentence for manslaughter arising from a melee between two groups of persons, where the criminality of the offenders arose from their participation in an affray, whether or not they engaged in physical fighting: R v Barghachoun [2011] NSWSC 1534 at [70]-[71]. As I observed in R v Barghachoun at [70], the assistance derived from these other cases is by way of illustrations of assessment of objective seriousness of offences of manslaughter, involving participation in an unlawful and dangerous act which objectively carries with it an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury. 

89The starting point in assessing the gravity of an offence of manslaughter is to recognise that it involves the unlawful taking of a human life. As RA Hulme J observed in R v La Rosa [2011] NSWSC 1394 at [32], there are a wide variety of ways in which the crime of manslaughter can be committed and there are an equally wide variety of ways in which an offender may be culpable. 

90I am satisfied that he Offender's crime is one of considerable seriousness. He was responsible for setting in train the conflict which led to two groups of young men clashing outside the Busby house. There was an element of planning and organisation with the provision of assistance by his companions to accompany him to the fight. 

91The Offender had an opportunity to walk away from the dispute after the intervention of JT's stepfather, but he chose to resume the dispute and return to the Busby house. The Offender emerged from the van armed with a metal pole, indicating his willingness to use force, and sought to confront JT for that purpose. Although he did not, in the end, strike a blow to any person, it might be concluded that the only reason that he did not do so was because JT got in first, striking him to the head. 

92It was accepted in submissions for the Crown and the Offender that the Offender was not intoxicated at all by alcohol or any drugs on this night. The fact that he engaged in conduct of this type whilst sober is a further troubling feature of the case. 

93In light of the above, the Offender's offence was an objectively serious crime. 

The Offender's Subjective Circumstances 

94The Offender was born on 5 August 1992. He was 16 years and eight months' old at the time of the offence and is presently 19 years' old. 

95The Offender did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. A background report dated 12 September 2011 prepared by officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice was furnished to the Court. In addition, a helpful report dated 19 July 2011 from Dr Christopher Lennings, psychologist, was tendered. A number of references and reports were also tendered, including a letter from Lee Studdert, the senior co-ordinator of the Links to Learning Program (dated 4 August 2011), a reference from John Yiannake dated 25 August 2011, concerning the Offender's employment as a crane-fork driver in 2011, a letter from Darren Forbes concerning the Offender's employment between September 2010 and June 2011 and medical reports from Dr Qureshi concerning health problems affecting the Offender's mother. 

96The Offender has a criminal history. On 24 November 2008, he was placed on an 18-month good behaviour bond for driving in a manner dangerous to the public and was fined for unlicensed driving. The Offender was subject to this good behaviour bond at the time of the present offence. 

97In addition, on 26 March 2009, the Offender was charged with an offence of aggravated break and enter whilst in company. He was on bail for this offence at the time of the present offence. On 9 November 2009, he was placed on probation for 12 months, with a condition for supervision by the Department of Juvenile Justice, for the offence of aggravated break and enter whilst in company. 

98The Offender is the second youngest of five children. His mother and father separated when he was seven years' old. His father now lives in Adelaide. The Offender lives with his mother, who requires hip replacement surgery. 

99The Department of Juvenile Justice background report and the report of Dr Lennings provide considerable assistance concerning the Offender. Dr Lennings observed that he is a young man of quite good intelligence despite his having left education early, probably for behavioural reasons. Psychometric assessment of the Offender revealed an overall IQ which placed him in the above-average range or better than the bottom 87% of the population. However, the Offender's behavioural regulation ability, and his emotional ability or mental cognitive ability, fell within the average range, but towards the bottom end. 

100Dr Lennings observed that, despite the Offender's excellent cognitive ability, he does have immaturity in his make up and has demonstrated impulsivity. Although Dr Lennings did not think there was any impairment of his ability to reason or to exercise sound judgment, he observed that 16-year old youths still need to develop adult methods of reasoning and adult methods of being able to understand and foresee consequences. Dr Lennings considered that this was a significant issue in the context of the present offence. 

101The Offender completed Year 9 of high school and left school at the start of Year 10, in 2008, of his own accord, to start an apprenticeship. The evidence reveals that, in 2010 and 2011, he has been in responsible positions and has an excellent work history. 

102The Offender has indicated to the Department of Juvenile Justice officers that, if he is incarcerated, he would utilise his time in detention by completing his secondary education and other studies. Evidence before the Court indicates that there are substantial opportunities for such education within the juvenile detention system. 

103The Offender's conflict with the criminal law appears to have been concentrated in a period in 2008 and 2009 when he was 15-16 years' old. Since 2009, he has demonstrated a capacity for good employment and a responsible approach to assistance to his mother. 

104There are still aspects of immaturity affecting the Offender. The evidence suggests that assistance is appropriate to help him to avoid conflict. However, the problems in this regard seem to be associated with his youth. 

105I am conscious that the Offender has been subject to a rigorous bail regime since 2009. An assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation must take that into account. However, it seems to me on all the evidence that the Offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, involving further education to allow him to apply his intelligence in the workforce in a positive way. 

Some Other Factors Relevant to Sentence 

106Mr McClintock SC, for the Offender, submitted that the Offender was entitled to a 25% discount for his plea of guilty. The Crown submitted that, although it was not a plea entered at the earliest opportunity, it should nevertheless be regarded as an early plea attracting a discount not exceeding 20%. 

107The Offender was committed for trial on a charge of murder. The offer to plead guilty to manslaughter was made prior to a trial date being fixed and the Crown agreed to accept the plea to manslaughter once it was offered. I consider that a discount of 20% should be allowed for the Offender's plea of guilty. 

108It was submitted for the Offender that he had demonstrated contrition and remorse for his offence. The conduct of the Offender on 25 April 2009 after he had learned of the death of Mr Boyce was not consistent with contrition or remorse. Nor was his conduct when police searched his house on the evening of 25 April 2009, when the Offender behaved in an extraordinary fashion, abusing the police and ignoring his mother's plea for co-operation. There is no suggestion that the Offender was affected by alcohol or a drug at the time when he behaved in this fashion during the police search. 

109The conduct of the Offender at that time points to a very angry young man who was acting in a manner which was entirely contrary to his own interests. His language and conduct was offensive, but suggests a significant measure of immaturity. 

110With the passage of time since April 2009, I accept that the Offender has developed a level of insight into his conduct which has given rise to contrition and remorse. I take this into account on sentence. 

111Mr McClintock SC submitted that the Offender's youth was a significant factor to be taken into account on sentence, with regard to be had to s.6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and principles concerning the sentencing of young offenders. He submitted that less weight should be attached to general deterrence in sentencing the Offender. 

112I have regard to the principles as summarised by Hodgson JA (Adams and Hall JJ agreeing) in AI v R [2011] NSWCCA 95 at [67]-[68]. In sentencing an offender who commits a crime at the age of 16 years and eight months, principles of retribution and general deterrence may be of less significance than when sentencing an adult offender for the same offence. Recognition is to be given to the capacity of young persons to reform and mould their character to confirm to society's norms, with considerable emphasis to be placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. In considering the role of retribution on sentence, the Court will have regard to emotional immaturity or a young person's less-than-fully developed capacity to control impulsive behaviour: BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; 201 A Crim R 379 at 381 [4]. However, as Hodgson JA observed in AI v R at [69], in relation to crimes of violence committed in the streets by groups of young persons, considerations of general deterrence should be given substantial weight, notwithstanding the youth of the Offender. 

113In the circumstances of this case, the evidence of Dr Lennings points to the role of the Offender's immaturity in his involvement in the offence. The same can be said concerning his conduct giving rise to the Form 1 offence. I consider that the youth of the Offender is a significant factor on sentence in this case, given the prospect that he will continue to make a positive and responsible contribution to the community with further education and continued employment, with the likely prospect that he will avoid criminal activity. 

114Nevertheless, general deterrence remains a factor on sentence given the approach of the courts to violent conflicts between groups of young persons in public places. 

Victim Impact Statements 

115A number of victim impact statements were read at the sentencing hearing by or on behalf of the mother and sisters of Mr Boyce and his younger siblings. As I observed in my remarks concerning Mr Barghachoun (at [84]), the tragic consequences for Mr Boyce's family resulting from his senseless death were explained eloquently and movingly by members of his family. Once again, on behalf of the community, the Court expresses its sympathy to the family of Mr Boyce for their tragic loss. I have regard to the victim impact statements, as part of the sentencing process, in the manner permitted by law. 
 
The Sentencing of Mr Barghachoun 

116I have today passed sentence on Mr Barghachoun for manslaughter arising from his involvement in the tragic events leading to the death of Mr Boyce. 

117In considering the question of sentence of this Offender and Mr Barghachoun, I have kept in mind the concept of relativity as between the sentences to be passed. That said, the roles of the Offender and Mr Barghachoun were different and there are other sentencing principles to be applied in the case of this Offender given his age at the time of the offence. 

Determining the Appropriate Sentence 

118Earlier in these remarks, I have addressed the question of the objective seriousness of the Offender's crime. Manslaughter may take many forms and it is necessary to determine penalty in the circumstances of the case. A constant factor is that persons who commits the crime of manslaughter are criminally involved in the taking of a human life. 

119For reasons expressed earlier, I am satisfied that the present offence is a serious example of the crime of manslaughter. It is necessary to punish the Offender for this crime. It is necessary that the sentence denounce the commission of the offence, with that feature measured to an extent by the Offender's youth in the manner which I have described. Again, it is necessary that the sentence reflects an element of general deterrence, once again measured because of the Offender's youth, given the approach of the criminal law towards offences involving violence between groups of young men committed in public places. 

120The Offender was subject to a good behaviour bond and a grant of conditional bail at the time when he committed this offence. These factors operate significantly against him on the question of sentence. In April 2009, at least, it does not seem that the brakes on criminal conduct which conditional liberty is meant to apply were operating in the Offender's case. 

121I accept that the approach of the Offender in 2008 and 2009, when he was 15-16 years' old, is markedly different to the approach which he demonstrates at the present time. This provides a positive foundation for the future, with good prospects of rehabilitation in conjunction with appropriate supervision and assistance. 

122Mr McClintock SC submitted that it would be open to the Court, in the circumstances of this case, to proceed by way of a non-custodial sentence. The Crown submitted that a sentence of full-time custody was the only appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the Offender in all the circumstances of the case. 

123I am satisfied that the objective seriousness of the crime is such that the only appropriate sentence that should be imposed is one of full-time custody. If this point was reached, Mr McClintock SC submitted that the Court should make an order under s.19(3) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 that any sentence of imprisonment be served as a juvenile offender. 

124The Offender is to be sentenced in respect of a serious children's indictable offence so that he is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after he has attained the age of 18 years, unless the requirements of s.19(3) of the Act are satisfied. 

125I make a finding of special circumstances, for the purpose of s.19(3), upon the basis that the only available educational and vocational training, or therapeutic programs that are suitable to the Offender's needs are those available in detention centres and because, if the Offender is committed to a correctional centre, there would be an unacceptable risk of him suffering physical or psychological harm: s.19(4)(b) and (c). I have regard to s.19(4A) in reaching this conclusion. My reasons for these conclusions arise from an acceptance of the evidence of Dr Lennings and the opinions of the Department of Juvenile Justice officers, Jennifer Pink and Jono Wheaton, both of whom gave evidence at the sentencing hearing, in conjunction with the tender of the background report which they had written. In my view, the Offender is at a crucial point in his development and the range of educational, vocational and therapeutic resources in the juvenile justice system are essential to further his rehabilitation. 

126Taking into account all objective and subjective factors, I take as a starting point, before application of the 20% discount for the plea of guilty, a sentence of imprisonment for five years. After applying the 20% discount, a head sentence of four years' imprisonment will be imposed. I am satisfied that a finding of special circumstances should be made for the purpose of s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 so as to vary the relationship between the non-parole period to be fixed and the head sentence. In this regard, I am satisfied that the Offender will require an extended period of supervision and assistance in the community upon his release, and that it is in the public interest that he have an extended period for that purpose. In light of the finding of special circumstances, a non-parole period of two years should be fixed. 

127Will the Offender please stand. For the offence of manslaughter, and taking into account the Form 1 offence, you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 2 December 2011 and expiring on 1 December 2013 with a balance of term of two years commencing on 2 December 2013 and expiring on 1 December 2015. 

128The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 2 December 2013. 

129In accordance with s.19 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 , I make an order directing that the whole of the term of imprisonment of the Offender is to be served as a juvenile offender.

2708773,R v KENNEDY [2011] NSWDC 223,"sentence

1HIS HONOUR: William Kennedy's life has at least until recently been a cascading series of terrible events involving orphanages, boys' homes, time in an adult gaol despite being only seventeen, service in Vietnam where awful events occurred, alcoholism, and, at about the time the offences I am about to describe occurred, a somewhat pathetic lifestyle. 

2It is terrible, indeed, that two victims of Mr Kennedy's offences came into contact with him and suffered significantly as a result. They have been harmed greatly by what he did to them. It is important to bear that harm firmly in mind when I consider the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. 

3The complainants, and I repeat, there is to be no publication of any evidence identifying or tending to identify them, first met the offender when he was invited by their father to live with him in a caravan where he, too, was living. The two sisters visited their father on the weekends, living with their mother at other times. The offender took advantage of his proximity to these young girls to sexually assault them in a number of ways. Two of those offences appear on the indictment to which the offender has pleaded guilty and other offences appear on two forms 1, one attached to each of the offences on the indictment. 

4I will describe the offences. In March 1986, A was visiting her father. She slept on a lounge in the annexe to the caravan and the offender slept on a mattress on the floor. He turned to A and said ""I've got something for you to feel"". He grabbed her hand and put it on his penis moving it up and down. He was naked and he ejaculated. He then got a handkerchief and wiped A's hand and wiped himself as well. This is the first offence, an offence of committing an act of indecency appearing on the form 1 attached to count two on the indictment. 

5The following year somewhere between March and July of 1987, B, A's sister, was watching television in the annexe. The offender slipped his hand into her underpants and rubbed her vagina. That is an offence also appearing on a form 1, an offence of indecent assault of a child. It is attached to count one on the indictment. 

6A month later, the offender further indecently assaulted B by taking his hand and putting it on the outside of his clothes over his erect penis. That is also on the form 1 attached to count one. 

7We then move to November 1990. Once more, the children were at the caravan park. A was by now fourteen years of age. The offender invited them into his caravan. The children went in confident that nothing would happen to either of them if they were in the company of each other. They were sadly wrong. After giving the sisters a coca cola and chocolate, he asked them to lie down on the bed with him and the two girls did so. A did not want to leave B alone. He lay down, that is the offender lay down in the middle of the bed with the two girls either side of him. As soon as they got into bed, he put his hand down A's tracksuit pants, an offence of committing an act of indecency towards a child under the age of sixteen appearing on the form 1 attached to count two and has inserted his finger into B's vagina. That is count one on the indictment, an offence of having sexual intercourse with a person above the age of ten years and under the age of sixteen. B was twelve years of age at the time. The maximum penalty for that offence is eight years imprisonment or at least it was at the time. 

8The following year in June 1991, A went to visit the offender. She was fifteen years of age at this time. When they met, they stayed out the front of his caravan and talked for a while. He invited her to come inside. She agreed but only on the proviso that the door remained open. She told the offender that she would not be coming back to the caravan park. The offender apparently took this last opportunity to do what he did. He said ""Now you are a woman and that you might not come back, I'm going to give you something before you go away. I'm going to get you before anyone else does"". He clearly indicated an intention, and a desire, to have sex with A before anyone else could. He closed the front door and locked it. He pulled her over to his bed and removed her tracksuit pants and underpants. He pushed her onto the bed and put his fingers inside A's vagina. He said ""Just relax. If you relax, it won't hurt as much"" and knowing that she was not consenting to what he then did, he climbed on top of her and put his penis inside her vagina. 

9Fortunately, they were interrupted. He only managed to thrust his penis in and out about six times before there was a knock on the door. A was in pain and was bleeding. She was also, not surprisingly, upset. The offender opened the door and explained to the caller, falsely, that A had just got her period and was upset and A went away. That offence is count two on the indictment, an offence of having sexual intercourse with A without her consent knowing that she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, that circumstance being that at the time of the offence, she was under the age of sixteen years. That offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 

10There matters rested for many years. Eventually, however, A told a psychologist what had happened to her. She then went to the police and reported what had occurred. Cleverly, the police arranged for her to make a number of telephone calls to the offender which were lawfully recorded. In those telephone calls, she asked if difficulties she had had in her life were from when they were ""mucked around"" and he said that he felt terrible for ever touching her. He said "" All I know is that I never had actual sexual intercourse with you or anything like that"". He said that he did not remember much from his past and apologised for things, whatever it was that he did. 

11He was arrested on 8 January 2010 when he attended a police station. He denied the allegations at that stage but did state that his memory was very poor. It was not until late in the piece, that he finally admitted these allegations by pleading guilty to the two offences on the indictment and admitting his guilt in relation to the offences on the forms 1. 

12I began these remarks on sentence by briefly referring to the cascading series of terrible events that have befallen Mr Kennedy. He was born in 1950. There are a number of siblings in his family but he has no real knowledge of many of them. He was put in an orphanage when he was five after being cared for by his maternal grandmother because his mother did not want him. He had no real contact with his father until a chance meeting many years later dashed any hope that he might be adopted. 

13He spent time at Yasmar before running away to Victoria. Whilst in Victoria, as a seventeen year old, he committed two offences, offences that would today not see a custodial sentence imposed. Indeed one of them is no longer an offence at all. He was convicted of having insufficient means and illegally using a motor car. Remarkably, he was sent to an adult gaol, Pentridge. This was at a time shortly before Ronald Ryan was due to be hung. He says that he witnessed rehearsals for the hanging. He was eventually released and he came back to Sydney. They then went back to a boy's home where work was found for him. 

14As part of his regular appearances in the Children's Court, a magistrate suggested to him that he join the Army so at the age of twenty he enlisted. It was at that time that the war in Vietnam was on and he was sent to Vietnam. There, as is distressingly common, he was exposed to terrible events which have had an awful effect upon him but his experience was worse than most. He was injured when either a rocket propelled grenade exploded or he was shot but much worse was an incident where, as a sentry, he fired upon a member of his own platoon killing him, one of those events that sometimes occurs in the fog of war. He was exonerated but, of course, blames himself and has done for years to come. He was particularly troubled by the circumstance that the person that he shot was a family man with children. After being honourably discharged, he joined Comalco where he was put in a division with former Vietnam veterans. Most of them were heavy drinkers and his alcoholism developed. His drinking was extreme, leading to his hospitalisation. 

15Mr Marr tendered today an assessment filled out by the offender for the Department of Veteran Affairs in the early nineties. It revealed the terribly pathetic lifestyle that he had at that time where he was deeply unhappy. 

16He has been involved in a number of relationships and has a number of children. One of them gave evidence on his behalf today. He explained the consequences for him of the offender's incarceration. They were certainly not extreme and are common place. I will, however, take them into account as part of the general mix of subjective factors. 

17Mr Watson-Munro has examined Mr Kennedy for the purposes of preparing a report for the Court. He describes one of the worst cases of post-traumatic stress disorder which he has ever seen. Mr Watson-Munro has been criticised from time to time in various circles but I note that in this case, his report was tendered without objection from the Crown and he was not required for cross-examination. I will, therefore, take into account the opinions expressed by Mr Watson-Munro. He explained that those with post-traumatic stress disorder often have problems with impulse control and on top of that, the offender was abusing alcohol at the time of these offences. 

18On the other hand, of course, he was clearly aware that what he was doing was wrong. He could have been under no illusions as to how seriously his conduct would be regarded by society, and the authorities, in the event that it was made known. 

19It is tragic that the lives of the complainants in this matter have intersected with the life of the offender. In two victim impact statements which they read to the Court, the complainants have eloquently set out the consequences for them of the offender's crimes. Those significant and distressing consequences are common in cases of this kind. In considering the victim impact statements, as Mr Marr pointed out to me, I have to apply the principles set out in the Court of Criminal Appeal decision of R v Bakewell (Unreported, NSWCCA, 27 June 1996) and I do that. 

20I want to say something about one aspect of the victim impact statements and I want to say it emphatically. In both of them the complainants express the feeling that they were in some way to blame for the criminal acts of the offender. They felt that at the time, they felt the heavy hand of responsibility upon them which led to them failing to disclose these offences for many years. It needs to be stated emphatically that they were, and are, blameless. The entire fault for these offences lies with one person and one person alone, the offender. As I said, he knew that what he was doing was wrong. He had the power to not do it but he went ahead anyway to satisfy his sexual desires. 

21The experiences of life suffered by the offender have led to him suffering an identifiable and significant mental illness. It is agreed that for those reasons less weight should be given to the principle of general deterrence. It nevertheless remains important. Also as a consequence of his mental illness, he will do his time in custody harder than what otherwise would be the case. He suffers from physical problems as well which I have taken into account in this regard also. Prison is a terrible place for everyone but especially so for those who are frail and at risk of violence from the violent men with whom the offender will be spending a significant period of time in the future. 

22There is the risk that the offender will serve at least some of his sentence on protection and there is the risk that if that occurs, he will serve his sentence in conditions of custody which are worse than those of the general prison population. I have taken both of those risks into account in formulating the appropriate sentence. 

23I mentioned before that general deterrence remains important although of less weight in the present case than in others. I want to speak now about specific deterrence. 

24The last of these offences occurred in the early nineties. There is no suggestion that the offender has committed other offences since then. It is a case where he is entitled to say that these offences were isolated and were the product of the situation which existed at that time. Because the offences have not been repeated, I am able to find that specific deterrence does not play a significant part in the formulation of the sentence that I will shortly announce. 

25What remains crucially important, however, is retribution. Courts must mark in a very concrete way the wrongfulness of the offender's conduct. Judges do this by imposing sentences which can, on occasions, be considered harsh in order to bring home to others just how wrong it is to sexually abuse children. 

26There is another aspect of the delay that I should mention. It does not appear that the offender has spent the intervening years racked with guilt, always afraid of the knock on the door and the coming of this day. There is no evidence that he has been unable to put the matter behind him, at least until he was arrested. 

27It is common ground that I have to sentence the offender in accordance with the tariff and maximum penalties that existed at the time of the offence; the Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear that that is what I must do despite the obvious difficulties which that brings about. Information regarding tariffs for various offences pre-dating the introduction of the sentencing information system by the Judicial Commission is hard to come by. In some cases there are publications available to assist a judicial officer, but in other cases there are not. 

28The Court of Criminal Appeal says that judges are able to use their own experience of the law, but gives no guidance to what happens when the judge does not have any experience as to what sentencing practices were many years ago. Judges are also required to take into account such matters as whether the offender would have been dealt with under the Sentencing Act or the Parole of Prisoners Act , a circumstance which does not arise here. 

29There is much to be said for the idea that the change in sentencing practices which has occurred over the last twenty years is a recognition that twenty years ago they were flawed. Nevertheless the law is that the offender receives the benefit of that earlier misunderstanding as to what sentence levels should be. 

30It is agreed by the lawyers in court that over the past twenty years there has been a growing realisation on the part of the judiciary of just how harmful offences of this kind are, and that has been one of the factors which has led to sentences increasing, in some cases significantly. I repeat, however, the offender is to be sentenced in accordance with the tariff and maximum penalties that existed at the time of his offending, not in accordance with the tariff that exists now. 

31Mr Marr, who appeared for the offender, conceded (and appropriately so), that nothing less than fulltime custody was appropriate given the gravity of his client's offending; he asked me to find special circumstances in his client's favour, a finding I will make given his age and the psychiatric problems from which he suffers. 

32The offender is sentenced as follows. For count 1 on the indictment taking into account the Form 1 matters attaching to that count, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of eighteen months to date from 14 December 2011. On count 2 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years and a head sentence of four years to date from 14 December 2012; that means that the effective term of imprisonment the offender must serve is a non-parole period of three years, a period of eligibility for parole of two years, making a total sentence of five years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 13 December 2014.

2708775,R v Barghachoun [2011] NSWSC 1534,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1JOHNSON J : The Offender, Saad Jamie Barghachoun, appears for sentence for the crime of manslaughter. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years. 

2On 6 May 2011, the Offender was arraigned before Latham J upon an indictment alleging that, on 25 April 2009, at Busby in the State of New South Wales, he did murder David Wayne Boyce. The Offender pleaded not guilty, but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of the indictment. The sentencing proceedings came before me on 3 August 2011 and continued on 20 September 2011. 

3At the outset, I observe that the Offender is not to be sentenced for directly causing the death of Mr Boyce. It is not alleged that the Offender wielded the knife which caused the fatal injury to Mr Boyce. Rather, the Offender's crime arises from his participation in events in the early hours of 25 April 2009 which saw two groups of young men coming into conflict, involving the use of violence, and with a person on the Offender's side of the conflict stabbing Mr Boyce to death. I will return to the nature of the Offender's crime and its seriousness later in these remarks on sentence. 

Facts of Offence 

4An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. In addition, the Offender gave evidence at that hearing. 

5It will be observed that a number of persons are referred to by initials and not by their full names. The tragic events surrounding the death of Mr Boyce included the involvement of persons who were under 18 years of age and who should not be identified: s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 . Where adult members of the family of young persons are mentioned, they will also be referred to by way of initials so as to avoid indirect identification of the young persons. 

6The Agreed Statement of Facts disclosed the following events. 

Two Gatherings of Persons at Wentworthville and Busby 

7On the evening of Friday 24 April 2009, Mr Boyce (aged 23) was visiting a number of friends at a gathering at Wentworthville. Persons at this gathering were drinking alcohol. There was also a suggestion that some persons were consuming a small amount of methylamphetamine. 

8At the same time, another gathering of friends was taking place at a house at Trevanna Street, Busby. These premises were leased by the ""T"" family - Mrs T (56 years' old), her de facto husband (55 years' old) and their son JT (17 years' old). 

9JT had a number of friends visiting him and they were drinking and socialising in the backyard. JT and his friend, JP, were heavily intoxicated. One of the visitors was RM (17 years' old) who was the girlfriend of JP, and a friend of Danielle Fox (18 years' old). 

A Dispute Between Two Young Men, AH and JT 

10At around 12.30 am on Saturday 25 April 2009, a telephone call was made during which JT asked RM whom she was talking to and, in particular, whether AH (16 years and eight months of age) was on the telephone. There had been ill feeling between JT and AH over their respective relationships with a young woman, CH. JT and AH argued over the telephone and the call ended. 

11At that time, AH was in the company of his friend Joey Smith (18 years and three months of age), Ms Fox and her friend Natalie Ryan (18 years of age). Mr Smith drove that group to AH's home. 

12AH got out of the car for a short time and went into the house. He returned carrying some metal poles. AH put the metal poles on the floor of the car. These metal poles came to be used in the subsequent confrontation. 

13At this time, the Offender was not with AH, Mr Smith, Ms Fox and Ms Ryan. Nor was he a party to, or privy to, the conversations between Ms Fox, RM, JT, AH and Mr Smith. 

AH Arrives at the Busby Home 

14A short time later, RM received a call from AH who stated he was outside the Busby house and wanted JT to come out and meet him. AH was there with Mr Smith, Ms Fox and her friend, Ms Ryan, waited in the car for some time on a street corner near the house. 

15JT and AH argued for a short time. During this argument, JT's friend, JP, was also present. JP was carrying a metal pole (about one metre long) hidden inside his pants. Mr Smith saw the pole and said ""Why do you have to be a dirty cunt for?"" . JP said ""In case someone jumps in"" . Mr Smith took the pole and said he was going to throw it. JP said that it was JT's pole and told Mr Smith to throw it towards the fence. Mr Smith did so. 

16During this argument, JT's stepfather came outside and intervened. AH refused to leave unless JT apologised. JT's stepfather apologised on his stepson's behalf and shook hands with AH. 

AH and Mr Smith Depart 

17Mr Smith and AH left the area on foot and returned to the car with Ms Fox and Ms Ryan. They drove away. 

18Meanwhile at the Busby house, JP questioned JT as to why he allowed his stepfather to intervene and apologise for him. JT became angry at his stepfather for sending AH and Mr Smith away. He attempted to contact AH so that AH would return to the area. He was unable to reach AH. RM called Ms Fox. 

AH and JT Agree to Fight and Both Sides Call for Supporters 

19JT took the phone from RM and said ""Get [AH] on the phone"" . AH and JT agreed to meet again so that they could fight ""one on one"" . AH believed that JT was too drunk. AH originally suggested that they sort it out, by fighting one on one, the following day. 

20During a telephone call, JT said that he was told that Mr Smith was bringing ""more boys"" . JT called his friend, Mr Boyce, on several occasions, asking him to come to Trevanna Street. Mr Boyce agreed to come and he brought several friends with him. 

21Mr Smith, AH, Ms Fox and Ms Ryan travelled to AT's house. 
 
The Offender Becomes Involved 

22Earlier in the evening, the Offender (aged 21 years), AT and Luca Alviggi had been socialising and driving around together in a white van. 

23AT received a telephone call at some point, from either AH or Mr Smith, asking him and the people with him (Mr Alviggi and the Offender) to meet Mr Smith, AH, Ms Fox and Ms Ryan at AT's house. 

24Meanwhile, Daniel Plesko (the cousin of AT), David Bosevski and Jason Hubbard arrived at AT's house in a separate car. 

25From AT's premises, a number of persons travelled in a large white van belonging to Mr Alviggi's father, towards the Busby house. They were Ms Fox, AH, Mr Smith, the Offender, Jason Hubbard, Mr Plesko, Mr Alviggi, Mr Bosevski and Ms Ryan. Prior to arriving at the Busby house, the group picked up Jesse Hubbard. 

26AT was driving the van, two other people were passengers in the front, and the rest were seated in the cargo section in the rear of the van. 

27Various metal poles were inside the van. There was discussion in the van between some of the males to the effect that they were going to the house for the purpose of a fight. 

28Mr Smith had possession of a knife. There is no evidence that the Offender knew about the knife or knew that Mr Smith was in possession of it, prior to arriving at the Busby house. 

Arrival of The Two Groups at the Busby House 

29AT stopped the van around the corner on Kaluga Street, Busby. He remained with the van while others got out and commenced walking towards the Trevanna Street house. As they were walking, a number of the males were carrying metal poles. 

30The Offender was carrying a hollow metal pole concealed up his sleeve. He was aware that some others in his group were also carrying metal poles. 

31As AH, Mr Smith and the Offender (and others) approached the premises, two males - JT and JP - were on the veranda of the Busby house. They saw the group approaching and retreated inside the house. 

32A 4WD vehicle drove towards the Busby house. Before the driver had stopped the vehicle (directly in front of the house), Mr Boyce, who was in the front passenger seat, jumped out with a baseball bat in his hand and approached several people from the van group. Three other males (Emery Newton, Greg Phoenix and Josh Tyrell) and two females (Casey Tyrell and Renee Hosking) were also in the 4WD. 

The Two Groups Confront Each Other and Mr Boyce is Stabbed 

33Shortly after Mr Boyce got out of the 4WD, he became involved in the affray with the persons who had emerged from the van. 

34Mr Boyce was stabbed once to the chest by Mr Smith. The wound penetrated his heart causing death. Blood from Mr Boyce was later analysed. Alcohol was detected as 0.065g/100 mL of blood. Methylamphetamine was also detected as being less than 0.02 mg/L. 

35Mr Boyce was found lying apparently unconscious in the front yard of the Busby house. The person who called ""000"" was apparently not aware, when the call was made, that Mr Boyce had been stabbed. 

36There is no evidence that the Offender saw Mr Smith with the knife or saw Mr Smith stab Mr Boyce. 

37Josh Tyrell, who had emerged from the 4WD, was struck to the head and the shins as he was trying to get inside the house. At one point during the affray, the Offender struck Mr Tyrell in the shins with a baseball bat. Mr Tyrell was later treated at hospital for a cut to the side of his head, broken fingers on his right hand and stitches to his right shin. 

38Greg Phoenix, who also emerged from the 4WD, was struck to the head by one of the males who had emerged from the van. 

39Before leaving the area, Mr Smith smashed the front window of the Busby house. Mr Smith then used a pole to strike and damage a vehicle that was parked in the driveway of the house. 

The Offender and Others Flee the Scene 

40Mr Smith, the Offender, AH and the other persons from the van quickly left the area and returned to the van. AT drove away from the area. 

41As the van was driving away, males inside the van were saying ""we showed them"" . AH said ""We wasted our time, [JT] didn't even come out"" . The Offender said ""Which one was [JT] , everyone was hitting everyone, I was hitting people but who the hell was [JT] "" . Someone said that a person had been ""knocked out"" . 

42Mr Smith was heard to say ""I think I stabbed him ... fuck fuck fuck"" . Another person in the van said ""I can't believe you stabbed him"" . Mr Smith was asked by someone in the van ""Where did you stab him?"" . Mr Smith replied ""In the ribs, I had to protect my mate"" . Ms Ryan saw Mr Smith with the knife in the van. 

43The evidence is not clear as to who was sitting where in the van in the journey to and from the Busby house. There were several conversations going on simultaneously, and there was music playing in the van. It is not clear exactly who said what, or what was heard by whom. Mr Smith is reported to have said about the knife that ""It has blood on it"" . He passed the knife to someone who wiped it clean with a tissue. 

44It is agreed that the Offender was not the person who cleaned the knife, but that he was in the van at this time, carrying a metal pole. 

Police and Ambulance Arrive at the Busby House 

45Police arrived shortly after the Offender and the others had left the scene. 

46Ambulance officers attended soon after (at about 3.18 am) and observed that Mr Boyce had sustained a stab wound to his chest. He was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital, where he was found to be in cardiac arrest and efforts to resuscitate him failed. He was pronounced dead at 4.03 am. 

Disposal of the Knife 

47The van eventually arrived back at AT's house. 

48AT was handed the knife by Mr Smith. He secreted it in a drain near his house. He has been sentenced in the Local Court for his role in getting rid of the knife. 

49Ms Fox and Ms Ryan walked out on to the street and waited by Mr Smith's car. When AH and Mr Smith came out, they all got in the car and drove to an industrial area nearby. They then drove to Mr Smith's house. 

50AH lay down in Mr Smith's house and fell asleep. Ms Fox received a call and was informed that someone had been stabbed and that the person was dead. Ms Fox told AH this news and AH told Mr Smith. 

51Mr Smith began to create a false alibi. He said to Ms Fox ""We weren't there, we were at home watching movies. If you have to give a statement use that as an alibi"" . Ms Fox said ""Yeah lets stick with that story"" . 

52Later in the morning, Mr Smith drove Ms Ryan home. When she was dropped off, Ms Fox said ""Don't say anything"" . Mr Smith then drove Ms Fox home. 

Arrest of AH and Mr Smith and the Police Speak to the Offender 

53On the evening of 25 April 2009, police attended AH's home address. There they arrested Mr Smith and AH. 

54Mr Smith and AH exercised their right to silence. 

55During the search of AH's house, police spoke with the Offender. He asked officers why Mr Smith had been arrested. Police told him that Mr Smith was arrested in relation to a murder at Busby the previous evening. They asked the Offender whether he knew anything about it. He replied falsely ""That's the first I've heard about it. I went out with my mate Luca for a while and then he dropped me off at my place .... Around midnight"" . He said that earlier in the evening he saw Mr Smith ""but he didn't want to do nothing so I called my mate Luca"" . He told police that he would be prepared to make a statement to that effect. 

56The Offender was taken back to the police station and he agreed to provide a formal statement. He told police that, on 24 April 2009, he was with Mr Smith and he did not see AH at all. He said that he went to bed at around 11.00 pm. At about 6.00 pm on 25 April 2009, he went to Mr Smith's house, woke him up and then went to AH's house. He said that, about 10 minutes later, police arrived. 

57On 26 April 2009, police spoke with AT. He showed police where he had secreted the knife. Police located a brown-handled knife in a leather sheath in a drain. It was later examined and DNA recovered from the side of the blade near the tip matched the profile of Mr Boyce. 

Arrest and Charging of the Offender 

58On 26 April 2009, the Offender was arrested and charged for accessory after the fact to murder, make false statement, conceal serious indictable offence and affray. He exercised his right to silence. 

Progress of Charges Against the Offender 

59In February 2010, a charge of murder, on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise, was laid against both the Offender and AH. 

60In November 2010, a contested committal hearing took place at the Downing Centre Local Court. On 2 February 2011, the Offender was committed for trial for affray and murder. The charges of conceal serious indictable offence and make false statement were withdrawn and dismissed. 

61As mentioned earlier, the Offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter at arraignment in the Supreme Court of New South Wales before any trial date was set. The Crown accepted this plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. 

62It was agreed at the sentencing hearing that the Offender spent six weeks and five days in custody on this matter. As a result, any sentence of imprisonment will date from 27 October 2011. 

Seriousness of the Offence 

63The Offender has pleaded guilty to the crime of manslaughter. He is to be sentenced for his participation in an extended joint criminal enterprise, in that he took part in an unlawful and dangerous act, an affray, in circumstances which objectively carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury being occasioned to a person. He went with a group of men, whilst he was armed with a metal pole, with the intention of using the pole as a weapon and he did strike a person with another implement, namely a baseball bat. 

64It is important to keep in mind that I am not sentencing the Offender for directly causing the death of Mr Boyce, nor am I sentencing him for his participation in a joint enterprise that had as its object, the doing of an act with the intention of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm. 

65In this case, the persons at risk of serious injury were the persons involved in the affray itself. These were the persons who emerged from the Busby house, with reinforcements from the 4WD (on one side) and the persons who emerged from the van, including the Offender, AH and Mr Smith (on the other side). 

66Although submissions were made at the sentencing hearing which suggested a small distinction between the bases upon which the Crown and the Offender submitted that the offence of manslaughter was made out in this case, I do not think that anything turns upon any such distinction. 

67The Offender travelled with a group of men, expecting that a fight was to occur with other persons. With others, he responded to a call for assistance on behalf of his friend, AH. Expecting that a fight would occur, he emerged from the van holding a metal pole. He participated in the physical confrontation, striking Mr Tyrell in the shins with a baseball bat. The Offender was not a passive bystander, but an active participant in the affray. 

68There is no evidence that the Offender engaged in any confrontation with Mr Boyce. Nor does the evidence suggest that the Offender was aware that Mr Smith was armed with a knife, let alone that he used it to stab Mr Boyce during the fight. 

69The Court was taken to a limited number of sentencing cases, including R v Diab [2005] NSWCCA 64, which were far removed from the circumstances of the present case. 

70The Supreme Court has had recent experience of sentencing persons for manslaughter arising from an affray between two conflicting groups. The context for those sentencing decisions, the conflict between members of two rival motorcycle clubs at Sydney Airport in March 2009, bore a number of significant differences from this case. However, persons were sentenced for manslaughter upon a basis not far removed from this Offender who came to assist their side of the conflict, even though (as to some) they did not get involved in any physical fighting, although willing to assist if required. 

71In considering the question of sentence for such an offender, RA Hulme J observed that the role of the particular offender was, relatively speaking, minor. His Honour observed, however, that such an assessment did not mean that the particular offence was anything other than a serious one with the absence of such factors simply meaning that the culpability of the particular offender was less than that of others: R v La Rosa [2011] NSWSC 1394 at [34]. Other manslaughter sentencing decisions for persons arising out of the Sydney Airport incident include R v Pirini [2011] NSWSC 1395; R v Aouli [2011] NSWSC 1393 and R v Costa [3011] NSWSC 1392. I do not refer to these cases as comparable sentence cases. Rather, the assistance derived from them concerning an assessment of objective seriousness for offences of manslaughter involving participation in an unlawful and dangerous act which objectively carried with it an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury. The offenders in the cases which I have mentioned did not strike the fatal blows and some did not strike any blows at all. Nevertheless, their crimes of manslaughter were serious. 

72The starting point in assessing the gravity of an offence of manslaughter is to recognise that it involves the unlawful taking of a human life. As RA Hulme J observed in R v La Rosa at [32], there are a wide variety of ways in which the crime of manslaughter can be committed and there are an equally wide variety of ways in which an offender may be culpable. 

73The Offender's crime is one of considerable seriousness. There was some element of planning and organisation in that there was a call for assistance with a confrontation and a willingness on the part of the Offender to participate for that purpose. The Offender emerged from the van armed with a metal pole, indicating his willingness to participate. He struck a member of the other group with a baseball bat. 

74I accept the Offender's evidence that he had been consuming ice that evening. That may serve to partly explain his involvement, but it cannot excuse it. It is apparent that others involved in the confrontation, in particular those from the Busby house, were affected by alcohol. A physical confrontation between two groups of young men who are alcohol or drug affected is the very scenario where very serious injury or death can occur. 

75The Offender was a willing participant in the confrontation and he himself used violence in the course of that confrontation. His was an objectively serious crime. 

The Offender's Subjective Circumstances 

76The Offender gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. He was 21 years' old at the time of the offence and is now 23 years' old. 

77The Offender was placed on 18 months' probation in July 2003 at the Bidura Children's Court for an offence of robbery in company. In November 2005, he was sentenced at the Liverpool Local Court for a number of traffic offences, the most serious being driving whilst his licence was suspended, for which he was placed on an 18-month good behaviour bond and disqualified from driving for 12 months. 

78A presentence report dated 18 July 2011 was tendered at the sentencing hearing, together with a report of Dr Emma Collins, psychologist, dated 7 July 2011. In addition, a number of other reports and references were tendered which described the Offender in favourable terms in his response to this offence since April 2009. This material included a report of Toby Raeburn, psychiatric nurse practitioner, dated 21 July 2011, a letter from Joanne Perry, social welfare manager of Inspire Community Services, dated 29 July 2011 and references from Antonio Alviggi dated 20 May 2011, James Moffat dated 18 May 2011, Jade Carroll dated 2 August 2011 and a letter from the Offender's mother dated 3 August 2011. This letter, together with a medical report dated 19 July 2011 referred to health problems affecting the Offender's mother and the role of the Offender in the care of his mother. 

79The presentence report was favourable to the Offender. The report of Dr Collins indicated that the Offender achieved a score that placed him within the below-average-to-average range of ability, outperforming 18% of the normative sample for his age. 

80I accept that the Offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. 

Some Other Factors Relevant to Sentence 

81Mr Button SC, for the Offender, submitted that the Offender was entitled to a discount in the order of 20%-25% for his plea of guilty. The Crown submitted that, although it was not a plea entered at the earliest opportunity, it should be regarded nevertheless as an early plea attracting a discount not exceeding 20%. 

82Although there is evidence of an offer to plead guilty to a charge of affray made at an early time, the offer to plead guilty to manslaughter was not made until the proceedings were before this Court. I propose to allow a 20% discount for the Offender's plea of guilty. 

83Mr Button SC submitted that the Offender was entitled to a discount because of his willingness to assist the prosecution, including a willingness to give evidence against Joey Smith at his trial for murder. At the time when this submission was made on 3 August 2011, there had been no statement proffered to the Crown on behalf of the Offender as part of an offer to assist in the trial of Mr Smith. Given the significance which Mr Button SC sought to attach to this issue, I adjourned the sentencing hearing to allow this aspect to be explored formally. When the hearing resumed on 20 September 2011, I was informed that the Crown did not propose to call the Offender at the trial of Mr Smith and that his offer of assistance was of no value. Mr Button SC submitted that the Offender's offer showed at least a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. 

84I take into account the Offender's offer to assist the Crown but, having done so, I do not consider that it provides any real assistance to him on sentence. It was an offer made late in the process and was one where the Crown saw no value in the evidence which he might give at the trial of Mr Smith. The credit to which the Offender is entitled, in these circumstances, rises no higher than an offer of assistance which suggests a willingness to assist the Crown authorities, but with no assistance of value actually being provided. 

85It was submitted that the Offender had demonstrated contrition and remorse. I bear in mind that the Offender left the scene with Mr Smith and AH and, when initially questioned by the police, provided a false account as to his movements on 24 and 25 April 2009. At the time when he provided this false account, he was aware that a man had died in the confrontation. The Offender's initial approach is not indicative of contrition and remorse. 

86However, the evidence suggests that the Offender has developed some insight into his conduct and has remorse. I take into account his remorse, which assists a favourable assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation. 

Victim Impact Statements 

87Victim impact statements were read at the sentencing hearing. Statements were made by the mother and sisters of Mr Boyce and his younger siblings. The tragic consequences for Mr Boyce's family resulting from his senseless death were explained eloquently and movingly by members of his family. On behalf of the community, the Court expresses its sympathy to the family of Mr Boyce for their tragic loss. I have regard to the victim impact statements, as part of the sentencing process, in the manner permitted by law. 

The Sentencing of AH 

88I have referred earlier in these remarks to the involvement of a young person, AH, in the tragic events leading to the death of Mr Boyce. AH has pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is to be sentenced by me today: R v AH [2011] NSWSC 1535. In accordance with proper sentencing practice, where possible the same Judge should sentence co-offenders: Dwayhi v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; 205 A Crim R 274 at 284-286 [33]-[46]. A separate sentencing hearing was conducted with respect to AH given that his plea was entered at a later time than the present Offender. 

89In considering the question of sentence of this Offender and AH, I have kept in mind the concept of relativity as between the sentences to be passed. That said, the roles of the Offender and AH were different and additional sentencing principles apply to AH, who was 16 years and eight months' old at the time of the offence. 

Determining the Appropriate Sentence 

90Earlier in these remarks, I addressed the objective seriousness of the Offender's crime. Manslaughter may take many forms and it is necessary to determine penalty in the circumstances of the case. A constant factor, of course, is that a person who commits the crime of manslaughter is criminally involved in the taking of a human life. 

91The present offence is a serious example of the crime. It is necessary to denounce and punish the Offender for his crime. It is necessary as well that the sentence reflect an element of general deterrence given the approach of the criminal law towards offences involving violence between groups of young men committed in public places. 

92Given the Offender's insight and remorse developed in the period since his crime, less weight ought be given to specific deterrence and the Offender's good prospects of rehabilitation must be taken into account. 

93I bear in mind the Offender's age and the evidence of his character generally. He was involved in a serious offence in 2003 which was dealt with in the Children's Court by way of a non-custodial penalty. To the extent that the Offender's involvement in this present offence suggests that he had not learned the lessons from the 2003 offence, I am satisfied that he has made substantial progress since 2009. 

94I have taken into account as well the relatively strict bail conditions to which the Offender has been subject whilst these proceedings have been on foot together with his willingness to assist, through Inspire Community Services, by volunteering in programs which will allow him to emphasise to young persons the risks of involvement in group violence. 

95Mr Button SC submitted that the circumstances of this case, objective and subjective, were such that the Court should suspend sentence. The Crown submitted that a sentence of full-time custody was the only appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the Offender in all the circumstances of the case. 

96In my view, the objective seriousness of the crime is such that the only appropriate sentence which should be imposed is one of full-time custody. If this point was reached, Mr Button SC submitted, and the Crown accepted, that a finding of special circumstances should be made. The Court is not entitled to double count positive subjective factors in favour of the Offender in setting the sentence, and then determining the proportion of the sentence which the non-parole period should constitute. I am satisfied, however, in the circumstances of this case that a finding of special circumstances should be made. In this regard, I take into account the need for supervision in the community upon the Offender's release from his first term of imprisonment. 

97Taking into account all objective and subjective factors, I take as a starting point, before application of the 20% discount for the plea of guilty, a sentence of imprisonment for five years. After applying the 20% discount, a head sentence of four years' imprisonment will be imposed. In light of the finding of special circumstances, a non-parole period of two years and three months should be fixed. 

98Saad Jamie Barghachoun, would you please stand. For the offence of manslaughter, you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and three months commencing on 27 October 2011 and expiring on 26 January 2014, with a balance of term of one year and nine months commencing on 27 January 2014 and expiring on 26 October 2015. 

99The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 27 January 2014.

		13 December 2011",2011-12-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708776,R v MAEA [2011] NSWDC 215,"SENTENCE 
1HIS HONOUR: On 20 September 2010 Rodney Maea and his brother Vienna went to a Centrelink office in Merrylands. They were seeking assistance from Centrelink. Centrelink is an important organisation which provides benefits to those members of the public who need them. The two brothers spoke to an officer about an application for a disability pension. One of the officers started to interview this offender about his application. She told him that he needed to provide additional identification. The offender's brother, Vienna, became upset at this and began yelling out, swearing and generally causing a significant disturbance. There were a large number of members of the public in the office at the time as well as staff. The officer told the brothers that she would go and get her team leader. She left her desk. 

2At the same time an interpreter attached to Centrelink, by the name of Ali Parsa, approached the two brothers. He asked them to moderate their language. This was an entirely reasonable request given the circumstances. There is no suggestion that Mr Parsa acted aggressively, but what did follow was the two brothers acting violently and continuing to act violently with the result that four separate people were injured. 

3Mr Parsa was the first victim. He said ""This is a lady, please, she is a woman, stop it"" . For some reason this caused both offenders to run towards him and punch him in the face and head. The blows were so forceful that he fell to the ground. The offenders did not stop, they continued to punch and kick him in the face, head and body. He tried to get away but they stopped him so that they could inflict more violence upon him. Eventually they stopped, leaving Mr Parsa bleeding from his nose and his head. He was taken to Auburn Hospital. He suffered cuts and abrasions to his face and was allowed to leave six hours later. 

4After dealing with Mr Parsa in that way they turned their attention to Mr Alfa Touray. He was a security guard who heard Mr Parsa calling out for help and saw what was occurring. Sensibly he said ""Leave this man or you will kill him"". He tried to rescue Mr Parsa, but this offender and his brother turned their attentions to Mr Touray and began punching him. He too fell to the ground and he too was struck while he was relatively helpless lying there. He was taken to hospital and was allowed to leave after four hours, the medical records show that he sustained a fracture of his nose, abrasions to his lip, a haematoma and tenderness to his left eye, cheekbone and over the ridge of his nose. For a while he had blurring of rhe vision in his left eye but that repaired itself. Mr Touray has provided a victim impact statement. It sets out his understanding of the consequences for him of the attack. Having read the victim impact statement I can say that the injuries he describes are entirely the sort of thing that I would expect from an assault of this nature. They were of course entirely foreseeable as well. 

5I now turn to the most serious of the offences committed by this offender and his brother. Having bashed Mr Parsa and Mr Touray the offender turned his attention to Mr Cahill, another Centrelink employee, after he bravely intervened. He yelled out to them ""Stop, police are coming"". The offender's brother said ""Let's get him"" and both of them did. The offender's brother armed himself with an umbrella and swung it at Mr Cahill's head, hitting him on the left side. He continued hitting Mr Cahill on his head. Mr Cahill put his arm up to protect himself so that he was hit on his forearm as well. The umbrella broke, but the offender's brother did not desist, instead he used the sharpened remains of what he was holding to stab Mr Cahill. Whilst this was going on this offender punched Mr Cahill a number of times. He too fell to the ground and once more the offenders continued to attack this man by kicking him a number of times. He kept screaming out ""Police are coming, why don't you leave?"" and eventually they did so. Mr Cahill was also taken to hospital, he received a number of injuries including a wound injury. Photographs were tendered which showed the physical consequences for Mr Cahill of being attacked in that way. He had a penetrating injury to his forearm which required suturing, he had a laceration to his scalp which also required suturing, he had bruises and other lacerations. Once more these are the sort of physical consequences that one could immediately expect from attack of the kind to which Mr Cahill was subject. 

6Not surprisingly police attended and began to search for the two offenders. Eventually they found them at Merrylands railway station. There was more violence when the police attempted to arrest the two offenders. Much of it is not to be sheeted home to this offender, his brother Vienna assaulted some officers independently of this offender's actions, but they both did assault Constable Andrew Dryburgh. When the two offenders were told that they were under arrest this offender lunged at the police officer in an aggressive manner and punched him to the head using both of his closed fists. The offender's brother took over after a while causing further injuries. Eventually the offenders were subdued with capsicum spray and they were arrested. Officer Dryburgh's injuries seemed to have been fortunately relatively superficial. 

7When I sentence the offender for the offence involving Mr Cahill he asked that I take into account on a Form 1 an offence of reckless damage to property. Why this offence needs to be taken into account is beyond me, it relates to some damage to the premises at the Centrelink office. 

8The offender Rodney Maea now stands for sentence for five offences, the first is an affray involving Mr Parsa, Mr Touray and Mr Cahill, then there are two offences of assault occasion actual bodily harm in company, one involving Mr Parsa and one involving Mr Touray. Then there is the most serious offence of reckless wounding in company involving Mr Cahill, that carries both a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of four years. Finally there is the offence of assault occasion actual bodily harm on a police officer on duty with a maximum penalty of seven years and a standard non-parole period of three years. I have taken into account the maximum penalties for each offence and the standard non-parole periods in the case of those offences carrying standard non-parole periods. My reason for not imposing the standard non-parole periods for those matters are to be found in these remarks on sentence. 

9The offender has a criminal history, he has served time in gaol before for an offence of robbery in company. He also has an offence of common assault on his criminal history and assault occasioning actual bodily harm as well. In fact he was on a bond for the common assault offence at the time he committed these offences. 

10The offender was born in Tonga. He came to Australia at the age of eleven, he had an upbringing which he described to a psychiatrist who interviewed him as a ""nice"" one and he was not subject to severe violence or abuse at home. His mother however died when he was quite young and he was later expelled from school. He has had some work but lost it, he told the psychiatrist, because he had difficulties in attending. 

11I expect that those difficulties are related to the most important matter concerning this offender. He is significantly mentally ill. As with all mental illness it is difficult to be precise as to the precise form of his mental illness but it is a chronic one characterised by periods of psychosis and serious mood disturbance resulting in disturbed behaviour and disability. Indeed when he was first taken into custody and interviewed by a psychiatrist he was found to be unfit to stand trial displaying quite inappropriate behaviour, laughing at inappropriate times, and becoming irritable to the extent that the psychiatrist felt a sense of personal threat. At times he appeared preoccupied, perplexed and fatuous, as well as suspicious and guarded at other times. 

12At the time of these offenders he was apparently receiving intramuscular injections to deal with his psychosis but he was also using drugs. I will get back to the significance of that in a little while, but it is important to note that since going into custody, since having his condition managed more closely and since he has been unable to take drugs, his condition has improved significantly. He was found fit to be tried in August this year and pleas of guilty were entered to these offences relatively soon afterwards. His brother, who remains to be sentenced, also suffers from a mental illness. 

13The consequences for a sentencing judge having before him or her an offender suffering from mental illness are well known. I will take into account that the offender's time in custody will be harder than it would have been had he not suffered from a mental illness. Also, in assessing his prospects of rehabilitation, they are of course closely related to the prospects of the offender being adequately treated upon his release from custody. As Mr Reetov said, his prospects of rehabilitation are guarded. I would not want in any way anyone to think that I was extending the sentence I will impose upon the offender because of this circumstance but it does remain the case that no submission could be made that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. 

14One other matter, and perhaps one of the most important matters which I have to look at in determining the relationship between the offender's mental illness and the sentence that I will ultimately impose, concerns the question of his moral culpability. At the time that he committed these offences he was not hearing voices and he was getting his anti-psychotic medication, but Dr Martin does see a link between the offender's behaviour in the Centrelink office and his mental illness, I quote what Dr Martin says: 


""From his own account it would appear that his mental state was disturbed at the time of the offending to the extent that he was experiencing some manic symptoms with excessive energy, lack of sleep, feelings of vulnerability and increased libido which is probably a function of having a background of schizo-effective disorder as well as significant and damaging use of cannabis and alcohol. A person who is elevated with serious mood disturbance because of a psychotic disorder in combination with drugs is highly likely to exercise poor judgment and to become excessively angry when confronted or in stressful situations."" 

15It is to be immediately noted that that opinion related to a person with a serious mood disorder who takes drugs and one of the problems in this case is that it seems to have been a combination of those two factors which led to the offender presenting himself to Centrelink in a highly aggressive way after a perfectly reasonable request was made by the first officer who spoke to the offender and his brother. Of course taking drugs is in almost all cases a voluntary activity and is illegal as well, that combination of circumstance in my view reduces the benefit that the offender can expect to obtain. When I consider his moral culpability, it is morally culpable to take illegal drugs whether or not the drug taker has a mental illness. On the other hand, as I suggested to Mr Reetov in argument, the offender's decision to take drugs has to be looked at in the light of the undoubted circumstance that he was mentally ill at the time. There is thus the somewhat convoluted and complicated interplay of factors when I come to determine the offender's moral culpability. I do find that his moral culpability is reduced because of the combination of mental illness and drug taking. Had the offender not suffered from a mental illness at the time of these offences the sentences that I would have imposed upon him would have been much longer than those I will soon announce. 

16These offences were of course spontaneous, they did not go into the Centrelink office intending to bash anyone but they responded to very reasonable requests in a very aggressive way, and once they started they did not stop. It appears that they only stopped assaulting people when no-one else approached them and when they believed the police were coming. In one sense the offences were all part of the one ongoing act of criminality but it has to be remembered that four different people were injured by the violent acts of the offender, four people have suffered harm and so it would be entirely inappropriate in my view for the offender not to receive extra punishment relating to the four separate victims. On the other hand the three offences involving Mr Parsa, Mr Touray and Mr Cahill are all effectively the same offence as the affray. The offender will not receive any extra punishment because of the first count affray. The criminality involved in attacking Mr Parsa, Mr Touray and Mr Cahill covers the criminality of the affray matter. 

17No-one has suggested these offences were other than serious, they clearly were. Each of the victims was performing a significant public service in difficult circumstances. They are entitled to look to the courts to protect them and to respond in an appropriate way when they have been violently assaulted. The offender must spend a significant further time in custody in order to reflect the objective gravity of what he did, but I repeat, had he not suffered from the mental illness he undoubtedly suffers from his sentences would have been much longer. 

18I will make a finding of special circumstance in the offender's behaviour. As is clearly obvious he is going to need close supervision upon his release from custody in order to reduce the risk of him further offending. Dr Martin for example recommends that he only be released under a community treatment order, a recommendation I wholeheartedly endorse. 

19I should indicate that I have discounted the sentences I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent. Pleas were only entered after arraignment in this court but, as I mentioned before, there were delays arising from the issues concerning the offender's fitness. The Crown quite properly suggested that I would discount the sentences by twenty-five per cent and so that is what I will do. 

20I impose sentences as follows: 

21On count 6 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. Because it carries a standard non-parole period I am not allowed to impose a fixed term, I therefore impose a non-parole of nine months with a head sentence of twelve months to date from 20 September 2010. 

22On count 2 on the indictment I set a fixed term of eighteen months to date from 20 December 2010. On count 3 on the indictment I set a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months to date from 20 June 2011. On count 4 on the indictment I set a non-parole period of two years to date from 20 December 2011 with a head sentence of four years. On count 1 on the indictment I set a fixed term of eighteen months to date from 20 September 2010. The result is an overall sentence consisting of a non-parole period of three years and three months with a head sentence of five years and three months. I have of course taken into account the matter on the Form 1 when imposing sentence on count 4.

		14 February 2012",2011-12-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708788,R v King [2011] NSWCCA 274,"Judgment 

Introduction 

1McClellan CJ at CL : I agree with Adams J. 

2Adams J : On 21 June 2011 the respondent was sentenced following his pleas of guilty for an offence of perjury (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment) to a fixed term of 12 months commencing 24 March 2010 and for an offence of perverting the course of justice (maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment) to a term of 16 months imprisonment commencing on 15 February 2011 with a non-parole period of 12 months. On 1 July 2011 the respondent was personally served with a notice of appeal against the leniency of these sentences. The offences were committed in connexion with sentence proceedings for an offence of breaking, entering and committing an indictable offence (the arson offence). The sentences under appeal were imposed after that for the arson offence but were wholly concurrent with it. The Crown appeals on the ground that the effect of concurrency was to render these sentences manifestly inadequate and that they were, at all events, manifestly inadequate. 

Background 

3On 28 February 2007 the respondent was sentenced in the Local Court for an offence of entering a building with intent to commit an indictable offence, larceny and malicious damage. He was sentenced on each offence to 18 months imprisonment (expiring on 27 August 2008), which was suspended upon his entering into a conditional bond. On 7 December 2007, the respondent broke into business premises in Wagga Wagga and set fire to them. He was arrested for this offence on 18 March 2008 and charged with the arson offence. He was bail refused from 18 March 2008. On 9 July 2008 he was committed for trial and appeared in the District Court on 8 December 2008, when the matter was adjourned to 9 February 2009. On that date he pleaded guilty to the charge. The sentence proceedings in the District Court commenced on 20 April 2009 

Facts 

4The following account is largely taken from the sentencing judge's reasons and, as I understand it, is not controversial. On 20 April 2009 the respondent conferred with his legal advisors about the sentence proceedings. He told them that his behaviour at the time of the fire had been influenced by the death of his brother, Dwayne, in a motor vehicle accident in Sydney which he said had occurred shortly before the offence was committed. He told them that his partner, Ms McKenzie, would provide that information and other subjective material relevant to his sentence. Accordingly, the respondent's representatives spoke with Ms McKenzie and, amongst other things, asked her to obtain some evidence of Dwayne's date of death and some written character testimonials. The sentence proceedings were adjourned to allow the defence to present relevant material and obtain a report from a psychologist. In a telephone call on 14 March 2009, recorded by police, the respondent told Ms McKenzie that he had lied to the psychologist by telling her his brother died before the fire when he had in fact died after it. On 21 April 2009 the respondent and Ms McKenzie again had a recorded telephone conversation during which the latter said that she was looking for things in relation to his brother's funeral to provide to the court and the respondent said that they would show the day on which he died. Ms McKenzie said she would fix that and was already two steps ahead of him. 

5In her report, the psychologist recorded that the respondent had told her that his brother died in late November, before the commission of the offence, and that he had attended the funeral in Sydney. He said he felt anger and guilt over his brother's death, as a result of smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol to excess. He was also angry with his boss and that it was in this combined mental state that he committed the offence. 

6On 27 April 2009 Ms McKenzie and the respondent again had a recorded telephone conversation in which Ms McKenzie said, ""we went and fixed the newspaper... yeah, we had to dodgy the - we had to fix it"". A day or so prior to 30 April 2009 Ms McKenzie and her sister Melissa attended the solicitor's office and gave to the receptionist a number of documents, including a photocopy of a newspaper dated 20 December 2007 showing Dwayne's funeral notice and stating 5 December 2007 as the date of his death. On 28 April 2009 the respondent asked Ms McKenzie what date was said to be the date of his brother's death; she first told him 5 November and then corrected herself to 5 December 2007. The solicitor copied the material to the Crown and counsel and the court in preparation for the sentence proceedings. 

7On 30 April 2009 the respondent's sentence proceedings for the arson offence were resumed. He gave evidence on oath to the effect that he had committed the offence largely because he was extremely upset by his brother's death and he was also upset with the way his boss was treating him. His counsel referred to the funeral notice whilst leading this evidence and asked him, ""In fact your brother died I think on 5 December 2007, is that correct?"" to which the respondent replied, ""Yes sir"". 

8Whilst the offender was giving evidence, a police check indicated that the motor vehicle accident in which Dwayne was killed in fact occurred on 14 December 2007, one week after the fire. When that information was brought to the attention of the Crown prosecutor, the proceedings were adjourned to enable an official death certificate to be obtained. 

9The respondent's legal representatives then withdrew and the respondent obtained new legal representation. The original page of the newspaper showed Dwayne's date of death as 14 December 2007, as did the death certificate. As it happened, Dwayne was buried on 21 December 2007. 

10The respondent was charged on 9 September 2009 with the present offences and was sentenced for the arson offence on 2 October 2009. The sentencing judge (who also sentenced him for the offences presently under appeal) noted in her reasons that the respondent had informed the psychologist about his brother's death and the emotional effect it had on him and had given evidence that he had been told by his mother as he was leaving work on 7 December 2007 about his brother's death, denying in cross-examination that in fact the date of death was 14 December 2007. The sentencing judge said in her reasons that there could be no doubt that the respondent's brother was killed seven days after the offence was committed. Her Honour said that she was unable to find him remorseful or contrite, given his false excuses explaining why he committed the offence and maintaining that he could not recall events clearly, evidence which she also rejected. Her Honour concluded that the respondent's prospects for rehabilitation were only fair. Her Honour noted that the respondent had misled both the psychologist called on his behalf and the Court, concluding in this respect - 

""He is not being dealt with for attempting to pervert the course of justice or punished for his deception other than to the extent that it affects any findings I might have been able to make about remorse and contrition or his prospects for rehabilitation."" 

11The sentencing judge held that the offences were not committed on the spur of the moment and noted that the respondent had involved his co-offender in ""his hair brained scheme"". 

12To complete the chronology of events, the respondent appealed to this court against the sentence imposed on the arson charge but, on 24 March 2011 the appeal was dismissed. 

Subjective matters 

13The respondent pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity in respect of the perjury offence and a 25% discount was allowed. In respect of perverting the course of justice, his plea was late and a discount of 10% was allowed. No issue is made of these matters. 

14The respondent did not give evidence in the proceedings. His background was outlined in the report of Ms Robiliard, forensic psychologist, dated 26 May 2011. A pre-sentence report of 7 February 2011 was also tendered. The respondent was 23 years of age at the date of the offence. The sentencing judge referred to the respondent's extensive criminal antecedents, which ""disentitled him to leniency"", but accepted that he was ""truly remorseful and contrite"". It appears her Honour also accepted the respondent's history of an abusive and neglected childhood, in which he was exposed to violence and drug abuse and suffered at the hands of his parents and siblings. Her Honour found that the respondent's prospects for rehabilitation were guarded and he was in need of extensive counselling. 

15The judge noted that the respondent appeared to be deeply committed to his relationship with Ms McKenzie and grateful to her family for the support that they had given and continued to give to him. She said that, when he discussed the current offences with Ms Robiliard he apparently broke down in tears and acknowledged he was upset for involving Ms McKenzie. He said that he had no idea just how serious an offence it was, he just wanted to get out of gaol. Ms Robiliard reported that he claimed to be angry with himself for committing the offences and involving his partner. Her Honour noted that psychological tests showed the respondent to be at the low end of the average range of cognitive ability. Depression was demonstrated at an entrenched characteristic level with added reactive attributes. 

Discussion 

16The sentencing judge correctly characterised the offences as ""aimed at damaging the administration of justice and... [striking] at the very heart of our system of justice. It is fundamental that confidence be maintained in our criminal justice system and the system must be protected from those who seek to undermine it."" Her Honour noted - 

""The maximum penalties available for these offences recognise the importance of protecting the integrity of the criminal justice system. However, these sections cover a wide range of offending behaviour. The offences can be committed by law enforcement officers, by people seeking financial reward for giving false evidence, the threatening of witnesses who are to give evidence or attempting to influence jurors in criminal trials or even judicial officers."" 

Briefly describing their motives by way, as I think, of placing the offences in the described range her Honour said - 

""On the part of Ms McKenzie, the offence was committed out of misguided loyalty in the hope of lessening the severity of penalty to be imposed for a very serious offence. On the part of [the respondent], it was an attempt to receive a less severe penalty. Clearly, they did not succeed and... were unlikely to succeed. Such a fraud is easily detected, as was the case."" 

17And added - 

""Any penalties to be imposed must not only punish these offenders but make it plain to all in the community that the commission of these types of crimes will normally be visited with serious punishment. General deterrence is the paramount consideration in sentencing for offences of this nature. 

Having taken all of those matters into account, and indeed the subjective circumstances of the offenders, I find that only custodial penalties will suffice. However, they are matters which fall towards the lower end of the scale constructed for like offences."" 

(The phrase ""scale constructed for like offences"" is difficult to understand. I apprehend that her Honour meant no more than the range of seriousness from trivial at one end to the most serious class of case on the other marked at each extreme by no or almost no penalty and the maximum penalty. If so, this is unobjectionable though perhaps not informative. However, the phrase used by her Honour suggests the existence of some other scale applicable to ""like offences"", which introduces an unnecessary element of obscurity.) 

18No issue is taken by the Crown with the primary judge's statements of principle. The real contention, as I have mentioned, is that if these principles were applied, the sentences could not have been made entirely concurrent with the sentence which the respondent was already serving. In this respect her Honour said - 

""The issues of totality arise for consideration in respect of [the respondent]. He is, of course, serving a lengthy custodial penalty imposed by me for a very serious offence. These offences are connected with that offence. They arose whilst he was awaiting sentence. I find that if the sentences were ordered to be accumulated, or even partially accumulated, that would result in a disproportionate penalty given the nature of the offending and the purpose for which these offences were committed. It is therefore appropriate that they be served concurrently with the sentence he is now serving. 

19Strictly speaking, the present offences were not connected with the arson offence itself but I think her Honour was merely pointing out that they were connected in the sense that they arose in the sentence proceedings. 

20There is no doubt that the principle of totality was relevant here. Although complete concurrency for separate crimes may be appropriate at times, ""... it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence can not comprehend the criminality of the other"": R v Cutrale [2011] NSWCCA 214 per Hidden J at [32]. I would not find that the sentences, as such, were manifestly inadequate. 

21In this Court, the Crown prosecutor pointed to the circumstance that it must be accepted that the sentence for the arson was appropriate and thus an additional period of imprisonment must inevitably have been imposed for the further offences. This argument has a certain logical persuasiveness but the approach is mistaken: it turns mere chronology into a substantive rule. The true question is whether it would have been an error (in the sense of House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499) to conclude, as her Honour in effect did, that the criminality involved in the arson offence and that involved in the present offences was adequately reflected in the overall sentence. Put otherwise, if the sentences had been imposed at the same time with some accumulation - thus with a somewhat lower sentence for the arson - would the effective sentence have been manifestly too lenient? The arson sentence was well within the available range but it was not at the bottom of the range, and there would have been room therefore to impose a significantly lesser sentence for that offence and accumulate by a compensating degree the present sentences, achieving the same total sentence as in fact resulted. It seems to me that this was the kind of reasoning implicitly adopted by the sentencing judge when her Honour decided that the totality of criminality was adequately dealt with by the overall sentence and that adding further punishment would be excessive. 

Conclusion 

22Here, the respondent was already serving a total term of imprisonment of something over six years and three months with a non-parole period of three years that commenced on 18 March 2009. He falsified a newspaper report in respect of the date of his brother's death and lied about being affected by it when he committed the arson offence. The lie was quickly and easily discovered. He suffered an appalling childhood and his intellectual functioning is at the lower end of average. This offence was an immature attempt to get undeserved sympathy for a crime of real gravity. It was not a lie designed to help him or another to escape conviction. There is certainly a proper basis for concluding that, even so, some additional period of imprisonment was appropriate. However, I would not conclude that the sentencing judge erred in the exercise of her discretion. Even if I were mistaken about this, I would, in the circumstances, accumulate only to an extent which would justly be characterised as tinkering. Accordingly, I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

		16 December 2011",2011-12-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708806,Cooper v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 258,"Judgment 

1BEAZLEY JA : The appellant, Bradley Douglas Cooper, was arraigned on an indictment containing the following counts: 

(1) That on 22 March 2003, he did murder Dale Kevin Muldoon contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, s 18(1); 

(2) That on 22 March 2003, he did dispose of the body of Dale Kevin Muldoon with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, s 319. 

The appellant pleaded not guilty to count 1 (the murder count) and guilty to count 2 (the pervert the course of justice count). 

2A jury trial commenced on 30 May 2005 before Buddin J in Bathurst. On 15 June 2005, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the murder charge. On 5 September 2005, the trial judge sentenced the appellant on both counts. The overall effective sentence imposed was 22 years with a non-parole period of 17 years. 

3The appellant appealed against his conviction. 

4The victim of the murder, Dale Kevin Muldoon (the deceased) was killed on the evening of Saturday, 22 March 2003, in the kitchen/dining room area of the home of the appellant and his partner, Julie Quinn. The deceased had been forcefully struck on his head a number of times with a baseball bat and with the back surface of the head of a tomahawk/axe. The appellant and Ms Quinn were both present at the time. The appellant, with the assistance of a friend, Kevin Denne, disposed of the deceased's body in a nearby forest the following day. The appellant's niece, C, drove the appellant and Mr Denne, with the body in the car, to the forest. The appellant and Mr Denne then went to the local tip, where the appellant threw a hessian bag onto a fire. The bag probably contained the baseball bat and the axe. 

5The deceased was listed as a missing person in early May 2003. His body was finally located on 19 June 2003. Both the appellant and Ms Quinn were charged with the deceased's murder and with disposing of his body with intent to pervert the course of justice. Ms Quinn pleaded not guilty to both charges and was tried separately, prior to the appellant's trial. She was acquitted of both charges. Ms Quinn's acquittal is central to the sixth ground of appeal, as explained below. 

6The primary case advanced by the Crown at trial was that the appellant had delivered all the blows, that is, the blows inflicted both by the axe and the baseball bat, to the deceased's head and thus was solely responsible for the murder of the deceased. This case was based on Ms Quinn's evidence that she saw the appellant inflict the blows to the deceased's head, both with the axe and the baseball bat and that, although she was an observer to the murder, she did not participate in any way. 

7The Crown also advanced an alternative case based on a joint criminal enterprise in which it alleged that Ms Quinn had delivered the blow with the axe. On this case, the appellant and Ms Quinn were both responsible for actions that led to the deceased's death and each had the relevant intent to either kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. 

8In an exchange with the trial judge before he addressed the jury, the Crown confirmed that its principal case was that the deceased delivered all the blows to the deceased's head. This was the case the Crown then put to the jury, namely, that the jury would accept Ms Quinn's evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant delivered all the blows to the deceased's head. So far as the alternative case was concerned, the Crown relied upon an admission that C said Ms Quinn made to her, that she had struck the deceased with the axe. 

9The defence case was that the deceased had picked up the baseball bat and struck the appellant and whilst he stood over the appellant with a knife, Ms Quinn came to the appellant's rescue and struck the deceased with the axe, killing him. The trial judge also directed the jury on the defence of provocation, based upon remarks made by the deceased to the appellant which caused the appellant to become angry. He pointed out, however, that the Crown would say that the appellant had not lost self-control in such a fashion as to be provoked. 

10The appellant did not give evidence and no other evidence was adduced in the defence case. 

Issues on the appeal 

11The appellant appealed against conviction on the following grounds: 

(1) The trial judge erred in leaving joint criminal enterprise as a basis for liability of the appellant. 

(2) Alternatively, if ground 1 fails, the trial judge's directions on joint criminal enterprise failed to identify and adequately explain the narrow factual foundation of which such a basis for liability might be available. 

(3) The trial judge erred in his directions on "" self-defence "" and "" defence of another "". 

(4) The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury appropriately or adequately on the subject and significance of Ms Quinn's alleged confession to C. 

(5) The trial miscarried by reason of the failure of the appellant's counsel at trial: 

(a) to lead medical evidence, including mental health service records of the deceased which would have shown that the deceased suffered from a psychotic mental illness and was prone to "" bizarre and dangerous behaviour "" and was "" aggressive "" and "" paranoid "" when intoxicated and when using drugs; 

(b) to cross-examine on material appearing in the medical records in order to support the drawing of the necessary inferences. 

(6) The prosecution was not entitled to rely on a case against the appellant based on a joint criminal enterprise with Ms Quinn, given her acquittal of the offence of murder prior to the trial of the appellant. 

12A further ground of appeal (ground 7), which raised a similar issue to ground 5, was formally abandoned by the appellant during the hearing of the appeal. 

13The appellant required leave to appeal as his notice of intention to appeal was well out of time. The Crown initially objected to leave being granted. However, the Crown withdrew its opposition to the grant of leave in respect of all grounds. In the circumstances, leave to appeal should be granted. 

14Ground 5 of the appeal was based upon the manner in which the trial had been conducted by trial counsel, allegedly resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Evidence was given by way of affidavit from trial counsel and the appellant, each of whom was cross-examined. Mr Parkinson, the solicitor who principally instructed at trial, is now deceased. However, file notes Mr Parkinson made during the course of the trial and notes of instructions and comments that the appellant wrote during the trial were in evidence on the appeal. The appellant waived privilege in respect of this material. 

The evidence at trial relating to the murder 

15The appellant and Ms Quinn lived in Lithgow with the appellant's daughter and Ms Quinn's 9-year-old son, J. The deceased also lived in Lithgow and resided with his grandmother, Daphne Muldoon (Mrs Muldoon). On Saturday, 22 March 2003, at about 4 pm, the deceased walked past the appellant's house. Ms Quinn's son waved to him and Ms Quinn invited him in. Ms Quinn said that the deceased did not appear to be intoxicated at that time. 

16At about 5 pm, the deceased and the appellant telephoned for a taxi to pick up a cask of wine for them. The wine was delivered by a taxi driver, Terrence Theobald. Mr Theobald gave evidence that the deceased, whom he knew, came out from the house and paid him for the wine. Mr Theobald observed that as the deceased walked back into the house, he was "" walking slowly and he appeared to be off his head on a mixture of drugs and alcohol "". 

17There was evidence that the deceased had been drinking and smoking marijuana with a friend, Darren Harvey, the evening before and had some further alcohol the next morning. The post-mortem report recorded the deceased's blood alcohol reading of 0.101. 

Ms Quinn's evidence 

18Ms Quinn was called as a witness in the Crown case. Her evidence was critical to the first basis upon which the Crown put its case, namely, that the appellant had delivered all the blows to the deceased's head. Ms Quinn said that she, the appellant and the deceased were seated at a table in the kitchen, drinking. Initially, the mood "" at the table "" was "" just basically normal "". She said, however, that the mood changed and the deceased became a "" little disorientated "" and was making irrational statements. She said he "" insinuated that [the appellant] was a 'rock spider' "", a known euphemism for a child molester. Ms Quinn said that the appellant became angry and punched the deceased "" maybe 3 times "". She said the deceased, who was a small man compared with the appellant, did not respond other than to put his hands up in front of his face. 

19Ms Quinn's son, J, was in the lounge room, watching television. Ms Quinn said that she took him into her bedroom where there was another television and shut the door. She said that she returned to the kitchen and made dinner for her son. The appellant and deceased continued to argue and the appellant became upset, yelling, "" [y]ou're not leaving here alive "". Ms Quinn said that the appellant picked up a child's metal baseball bat that was in the corner of the room and struck the deceased, who was still seated at the table, on the back of the head about three or four times. The deceased got up and tried to put his arm up, but the appellant struck him again on the back of the head and he fell to the floor on his stomach. The baseball bat broke during the course of the blows, leaving the bat with a sharp, serrated edge, with which, Ms Quinn said, the appellant forcefully poked the deceased's head. 

20The appellant said that he wanted to go to the toilet and handed Ms Quinn the bat, instructing her to hit the deceased if he moved. Ms Quinn said that she didn't take hold of the bat when the appellant handed it to her and it fell to the floor. Ms Quinn said she went over to the deceased and shook him and told him to "" get out of here "". She said the deceased did not respond. The appellant came back into the kitchen and Ms Quinn said that she went to check on J. Ms Quinn said she then heard a "" scrape sound from the kitchen "" which she knew to be "" the kids little axe they used to chop the firewood ... sliding down the wall from where it was kept "". 

21Ms Quinn said that she went back to the kitchen and saw the appellant hitting the deceased "" two or three times "" on the temple with the axe (Tr 336). She said that by the time she reached the kitchen, she saw the deceased lying on the floor and ""[ the appellant] had the axe in his hand and then I just stood there and he ripped ... "". She explained that when she walked into the kitchen she saw the appellant holding the axe and, with a "" hitting motion "", strike the deceased. She said she saw the axe land on the deceased's right temple. 

22Ms Quinn said that shortly afterwards, the appellant got a blanket from the lounge room and told Ms Quinn to help him wrap the deceased's body in it. The appellant then said he was going to telephone Mr Denne and he left the house for a short time. It was common ground at the trial that the appellant did not have a telephone service to his home and that there was a public telephone nearby. Ms Quinn said that Mr Denne came to the house sometime around midnight. She said that she was finishing mopping up the floor when he arrived. 

23Ms Quinn also said that later that same evening, the appellant threatened her, saying, "" I've known this fuckwit all my life and I killed him like that, I've only known you five years, imagine what I'll do to you "". In cross-examination, she was unsure whether the appellant made this threat before or after the appellant hit the deceased with the axe. 

24The following morning, C arrived at the appellant's house in her car and drove the appellant and Ms Quinn to Mr Denne's house. Ms Quinn stayed at Mr Denne's house and C left in her car with the appellant and Mr Denne. 

25Ms Quinn said that the appellant instructed her, as he was leaving Mr Denne's house, not to return home until midday and that she was not to speak to anyone. She said she arrived home at about 12.05 pm and C arrived, alone, by car, sometime later. Ms Quinn's evidence in chief then proceeded as follows: 

""Q. Did she come into the house? 
A. Yes. 

Q: Was there any conversation between the two of you in the house? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What was that? 
A: She told me that the boys would find their own way back that evening. 

Q: Was there any other conversation? 
A: No."" 

26Ms Quinn denied in cross-examination that the deceased struck the appellant with the baseball bat after the appellant had punched the deceased. She denied that there had been a tussle in which the appellant ended up on the floor on his back and the deceased was "" over the top of him "", "" pressing [a knife] towards the [appellant's] throat "". She denied that she was standing in front of the deceased at this time and "" picked up the axe ... and struck [the deceased] four times to the head "". She denied that she and the appellant then discussed what to do with the deceased's body or that the appellant "" had decided to get rid of [the deceased's] body in order to protect [her] "". She denied that she was responsible for the deceased's death. Ms Quinn denied she had told C that she had used the mop and bucket to clean the blood from the walls and ceiling. 

Mr Denne's evidence 

27Mr Denne was a longstanding friend of the appellant and lived 10 minutes walk away from the appellant's home. According to call charge records, the appellant telephoned Mr Denne from a nearby public telephone at 1.24 am on Sunday, 23 March 2003. The appellant told Mr Denne that he wanted to speak to him about something important. 

28Mr Denne said that when he arrived at the appellant's house, Ms Quinn was mopping up blood. He saw a body wrapped in a blanket. He said that Ms Quinn pulled back the top part of the blanket and he saw the deceased's head with blood on it. Mr Denne was challenged in cross-examination as to who had pulled back the blanket. He eventually said the appellant had pulled back the blanket. 

29Mr Denne said he asked the appellant what had happened and he responded that the deceased had threatened the appellant's and Mr Denne's family and "" they got into a fight "". The evidence as to the threat to Mr Denne's family is to be understood in the context that one of Mr Denne's daughters was the appellant's biological daughter. Mr Denne said he reluctantly agreed to help dispose of the deceased's body. 

30Mr Denne went home and sometime after 8 am the following morning, Sunday, 23 March, the appellant and Ms Quinn arrived at Mr Denne's house with C, who was driving her vehicle. Mr Denne said he was still reluctant to assist with the disposal of the body, but that the appellant threatened him if he did not, saying, "" If you don't come and help me I'll put you with him "". 

31Mr Denne gave evidence of how and where they disposed of the deceased's body. He said that C drove him and the appellant back to the appellant's house. They put the body in C's vehicle and the appellant directed C to bushland where they buried the body. Mr Denne also gave evidence of throwing a hessian bag onto a fire at the tip. Mr Denne said he noticed that both of the appellant's hands were bruised. 

32Mr Denne admitted in cross-examination that he had initially lied to police in that he said a male had assisted to move the deceased's body from the kitchen to the car and had driven the car into the bush. He said he was trying to protect C, who was a minor at the time. He denied that he had told a Ms McKenna that Ms Quinn had admitted to him that she had killed the deceased. He also denied that he was trying to protect Ms Quinn, because of a brief liaison he had had with her. He denied that he had drunk any alcohol when in C's vehicle, as C alleged. 

C's evidence 

33The appellant's niece, C, was charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder but was granted an indemnity on condition that she give evidence in the appellant's trial. 

34In her evidence, C said that at the appellant's request, she went to his house one morning of the weekend of 22-23 March 2005. She went into the lounge room but did not notice anything unusual. She said that the appellant asked her to drive him and Ms Quinn to Mr Denne's house. On the way, the appellant said he would "" explain it all later "". 

35C said she was at Mr Denne's house for five or ten minutes and then went back to her vehicle with the appellant and Mr Denne. Ms Quinn stayed behind with Mr Denne's partner. The appellant asked C to drive them to a liquor outlet. On the way to the liquor outlet, the appellant said to her that someone had come to the house threatening the kids' lives and that he had "" put a stop to it "". In cross-examination, C was uncertain as to the terms of the conversation but said that the effect of what the appellant had said was that there had been a fight. 

36C said that after stopping at the liquor outlet, they drove to the appellant's house. She said that, on the way, the appellant and Mr Denne each drank a longneck bottle of VB which they had bought at the liquor outlet. On 17 June 2003, police found two VB bottles in the bush where C had driven the appellant and Mr Denne with the body. Fingerprint testing of the bottles produced a nil result, although the paper label was not tested for fingerprints. No DNA testing was conducted on the bottles. 

37When they arrived back at the appellant's house, C emptied the boot of her car and gave the appellant a blue tarpaulin which he took into the house. When she went inside, C saw something wrapped in a blanket and assumed it was a body. She helped the appellant move a table and chairs that were in front of it and then on the appellant's instructions, went outside to keep a "" lookout "". 

38C said that the appellant and Mr Denne brought the body out to the vehicle, wrapped in the tarpaulin, and put it in the boot. A bag, with "" two handles poking out of it "", was also put into the boot. One handle looked like a baseball bat with a red rubber handle and the other was wooden, which she thought was an axe handle. A mop and bucket were also placed in the boot. The appellant told her he was taking a change of clothing with him. 

39C said that she drove to a clearing in bushland to which the appellant directed her. The body, bag, and the bucket and mop were removed from the boot. When C asked what the bag was for, the appellant told her "" We have to get rid of it because it had DNA on it "". The appellant told C to leave and to tell Ms Quinn that he and Mr Denne would find their own way back. 

40C said that she observed that the appellant's knuckles on his right hand were swollen. 

41C returned to the appellant's home and spoke to Ms Quinn. Her evidence as to their conversation was the critical evidence upon which the case on joint criminal enterprise was based. It is convenient to consider what C had to say on this point, first, through her statement to the police, upon which she was cross-examined and which she adopted as correct and then in her evidence-in-chief. 

42In her statement to the police, C said, relevantly: 

""[Ms Quinn] said that [the deceased] came around and they were all chummy, talking as friends as they do and then [the deceased], they got alcohol delivered by taxi, right, and then were drinking and then [the deceased] said something, I got told [the deceased] said something about the kids and he was going to kill [the appellant's daughter] ... and [the appellant] just - [Ms Quinn] said [the appellant] just went ballistic and started hitting him and - and [the deceased] started hitting [the appellant] and [Ms Quinn] didn't know what to do so she grabbed the axe and hit him in the head with it and she said it cut him straight down the face ... and that's what he's told me so that was, she said, I didn't know what she said, I didn't know what to do because I thought he was going to kill [the appellant] and so that's where it ended."" 

43In her evidence-in-chief at trial, C said that when she returned to the appellant's house after leaving the bush where she had left the appellant and Mr Denne, she asked Ms Quinn what had happened. She said that Ms Quinn said: 

""... she told me that it was [the deceased], she said they were having a fight. 

... 
My uncle and [the deceased] and it got out of hand. I'm not sure whether it was, she said that she hit him or whether it was my uncle that hit him. 

Q. When you say 'hit him', who do you mean by 'him'? 
A. Hit [the deceased]. 

Q. Did she say what [the deceased] was hit with? 
A. With an axe."" 

44C said that she went into the kitchen and saw stains on the wall and ceiling and Ms Quinn had told her "" that it sprayed "" and it "" was from [the deceased] "". She said that Ms Quinn had told her that the deceased had been hit on the face. Her evidence-in-chief continued: 

""Q: Did she say who it was that hit him on the face? 
A: I was sure she said that she hit him."" 

45As well as agreeing in cross-examination that her statement to police was correct, C also agreed that she said to the police: 

""I was in the lounge room with [Ms Quinn] and she told me that she'd hit him with an axe and it hit his head. I'm not sure which way that it had hit his head but he was still alive and blood was spurting on the roof and all around the house and stuff like that."" 

46C agreed that she had told police that she had asked Ms Quinn about the stain on the ceiling and that Ms Quinn had answered, "" That was where I hit him with the axe "" and "" blood was spurting from his head "". She said that Ms Quinn had told her that the stains were where blood had been on the wall and ceiling. 

47C also gave evidence that the appellant told her that the police had been to his house. She said that he told her not to tell the police anything. He told her that he thought that Mr Denne had said something to the police and added "" whoever tells the police is going to end up in the same place that [the deceased] did "". 

Ms Quinn's response to the alleged admission to C 

48In her evidence, Ms Quinn said that C came back to Mr Denne's house and asked who was in the blanket. She said that she responded by asking "" Didn't your uncle tell you? "" She denied that C asked how the murder happened, or that she had told C that she had hit the deceased with the axe. She denied telling C that the deceased had threatened to kill the appellant's daughter and denied that she had told C that she had cleaned up the wall and ceiling with a mop and bucket. She denied that she told C that there had been blood spurting on to the roof from the deceased's head. 

Dr Little's evidence 

49Dr Little, forensic pathologist, conducted a post-mortem examination of the deceased's body on 23 June 2003. At the time of the post-mortem, the deceased's blood alcohol reading was 0.101. Dr Little gave evidence that at the time of death, his blood alcohol level could have been anywhere between 0.101 and half of that, as blood alcohol levels can increase in a decomposing body. Dr Little did not know whether any tests had been done for cannabis. 

50The post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had sustained four injuries to his head, caused by at least four separate blows. Injury number 1 was a large, slightly curved hole in the scalp on top of the right side of the head. There were a large number of skull fractures associated with this injury and a piece of bone had also depressed down into the skull cavity. One of the fractures was star shaped, in the thick bone at the back of the skull and went down to the top of the spinal cord. Another fracture went up the back of the skull, over the left side and then over the top of the skull, ending up in the midline where the two skull bones join. There were lacerations at both the front and the back of the skull. The total distance from the laceration at the front to the two lacerations at the back was 70 mm. Dr Little's opinion was that the lacerations were caused by blunt force trauma rather than by a sharp object. Dr Little accepted that if an axe was blunt, it would tear the tissues and look more like a laceration. 

51Injury number 2 was comprised of two fairly superficial lacerations or tearing wounds on the right temple above the ear. These lacerations penetrated the outer layer of the skin only. No bruising was observed associated with these lacerations. There were a large number of fractures around injury number 2 which could have been due to injury number 1. Dr Little could not rule out injury number 2 exacerbating the fractures caused by injury number 1, although she considered this was unlikely. Dr Little considered that it was possible that both lacerations were caused by a single blow, although she could not rule out that they had been caused by two blows. 

52Injury number 3 was a diagonal laceration on the back of the left side of the head. It measured 39 mm. The injury was not a full thickness injury and there were no skull fractures associated with it. 

53Injury number 4 was a laceration at the back of the head, approximately in the midline and slightly lower than injury number 3. It was shaped like a star from which four splits in the skin radiated out. One went upwards and measured 22 mm. Another went outwards at the two o'clock position and measured 25 mm. Another went outwards at the four o'clock position and measured 32 mm. The other went outwards at the eight o'clock position and measured 17 mm. These lacerations were the full thickness of the skin and could have been caused by a single blow, although it was possible that they were caused by multiple blows. 

54Dr Little was of the opinion that injuries 2, 3 and 4 were caused by a blunt object, such as a baseball bat. She considered it was unlikely that such an object caused injury number 1, because the shape of that injury would be difficult to be caused by a bat and was too small to have been caused by a baseball bat. She was of the opinion that an injury such as injury number 1 was highly likely to have been caused by the back surface of the head of an axe or by a blunt axe. 

55In Dr Little's opinion, injuries 1 and 4 involved the use of considerable force. She considered that injury number 4 occurred before injury number 1. She also said that injury number 4 could have caused a loss of consciousness, but this was not necessarily so. She was of the opinion that either injury number 1 or injury number 4 could have caused death. 

56Dr Little said that she had examined inside the deceased's face and did not see any bruising to the face. She was cross-examined as to whether, if there had been significant blows to the face, there would have been swelling or bruising to that area. She responded that if there had been significant bruising, she would have expected to have been able to see it. 

57Dr Little said that there were only relatively few blood vessels in the area of the injuries that she found and that these would not spurt blood. She was asked to assume that there were blood stains on the walls and the ceiling of the appellant's kitchen and, on that assumption, whether she could offer an explanation as to how that might have occurred, if blood had not spurted from a wound. Dr Little explained that there was a phenomenon called "" cast-off blood "", which occurred when blood on an implement that was being used to hit someone got "" flung off "", as the implement was lifted. She said that "" cast-off blood "" propelled "" quite a distance "". 

Other evidence 

58There was other evidence in the trial, including as to where the deceased spent the night before his death, from his mother and grandmother, and from Mr Selmes, who knew the deceased and saw the appellant and the deceased at the public phone near the appellant's house, on the afternoon of 22 March 2003. This evidence is considered below in conjunction with ground 5, to which it is relevant. 

Grounds 1-4: errors relating to the case based on joint criminal enterprise as a basis for liability of the appellant 

59In grounds 1-4, the appellant challenged the Crown case based on joint criminal enterprise. The appellant's basal proposition was that on the evidence at trial, there was no basis to leave a case of joint criminal enterprise to the jury. He submitted that there was no evidence of pre-concert or of any agreement upon which to base a case of joint criminal enterprise. The appellant further contended that not only was there no evidence to support a case of joint criminal enterprise, such a case was not properly articulated to the jury by his Honour or, for that matter, by the Crown. Rather, directions on the joint criminal enterprise case became intertwined with how the jury should deal with Ms Quinn's alleged confession to C and with the issue whether Ms Quinn had acted in self-defence or, more accurately, in defence of a third person. The appellant argued that the result was that the case of joint criminal enterprise was not put properly to the jury. 

Joint criminal enterprise 

60A case based on joint criminal enterprise carries with it the notion of agreement. In Osland v R [1998] HCA 75; 197 CLR 316 McHugh J stated, at [72]: 

""... a person ... present at the scene [of the crime] with a person who committed the acts alleged to constitute a crime but was there by reason of a pre-concert or agreement with that person to commit the crime [is liable as a principal in the first degree]."" 

61His Honour adopted as correct the principle stated in Brett, Waller and Williams, Criminal Law , 8 th ed, p 465: 

""[E]ven if only one participant performed the acts constituting the crime, each will be guilty as principals in the first degree if the acts were performed in the presence of all and pursuant to a preconceived plan. In this case, the parties are said to be acting in concert."" 

62In McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 the High Court noted, at 113: 

""The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuit of a common criminal enterprise."" 

Their Honours continued: 

""... the complicity of a secondary party [to a crime] may ... be established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute a crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission."" 

63As Osland and McAuliffe make apparent, a party to a joint criminal enterprise is liable as a principal. This has particular relevance in the present case as Ms Quinn was acquitted of the deceased's murder, a matter upon which the appellant relied in support of ground 6 of the appeal. However, McHugh J's observation in Osland at [79], 345, is of particular importance in this regard. His Honour said: 

""The principle that those who act in concert and are present at the scene are responsible for the acts of the actual perpetrator operates to make a person guilty of the principal crime, even though the actual perpetrator is acquitted completely."" (emphasis added) 

64McHugh J referred, by way of example, to a perpetrator who was legally insane and thus not criminally liable for a crime. His Honour noted, however, that so long as that person had sufficient mental capacity to enter into the arrangement or common understanding to commit the crime, the other participant in the agreement or common understanding who was present at the crime will be guilty of committing the offence as a principal, if that other participant had the relevant mens rea: see Matusevich v R [1977] HCA 30; 137 CLR 633. In other words, it is the accused's state of mind which is relevant, not the state of mind of the perpetrator of the offence, in determining whether the accused, as a party to a joint criminal enterprise, is guilty as principal of the crime constituted by the acts of the perpetrator. 

65This principle was applied in Markby v R [1978] HCA 29; 140 CLR 108. There, it was held that a participant in a joint criminal enterprise, which had violence as one of its contemplated incidents, could be convicted of manslaughter notwithstanding that the person who carried out the killing was convicted of murder. As McHugh J noted in Osland , at [81], the decision in Markby is consistent with the notion that it is the acts constituting the actus rea of the actual offender which are attributed to the other party, not the crime itself. See also R v Lowery and King (No. 2) [1972] VR 560. 

66Although agreement is central to the concept of joint criminal enterprise, the authorities are clear that there does not have to be a plan or arrangement reached before the participants set out to commit the criminal activity. A joint criminal enterprise is often proved by the presence of the accused at the scene of the crime and that person aiding and abetting the commission of the crime by the perpetrator. In R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545, Hunt CJ at CL, at 556-557, in a passage approved by McHugh J in Osland , stated: 

""So far as a straightforward joint criminal enterprise is concerned, the jury should be directed along these lines: 

(1) The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused. 

(2) A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime. 

(3) A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime ."" (emphasis added) 

67To the extent that these principles are relevant to the circumstances of this case, they may be summarised as follows. For there to be liability for a crime by way of a joint criminal enterprise, there has to be more than mere presence at the crime. There has to be an agreement, express or tacit, to commit the crime, or, being present when the crime is being committed, there has to be a readiness to give assistance if required, or there has to be intentional assistance or encouragement to another participant, in the crime. The relevant mental state is that of the accused person. Thus an accused may be guilty of an offence, based on a joint criminal enterprise, even where the perpetrator is found not guilty of the crime or is found guilty of another crime. 

Was there a case to be put to the jury on the basis of joint criminal enterprise? 

Ground 1 

68The appellant submitted that the Crown failed to prove any agreement for the purposes of the case based on joint criminal enterprise. He contended that there was no evidence of antecedent agreement, nor did the Crown contend for one. Accordingly, any joint criminal enterprise in this case had to be based upon some other form of involvement in the crime. The appellant contended that there was no evidence of an agreement arising during the course of the crime being committed, or any evidence from which an agreement could be inferred, or any evidence of encouragement or willingness to assist the appellant in murdering the deceased. 

69It will be recalled that by the time of the appellant's trial, Ms Quinn had been acquitted of the deceased's murder. At the appellant's trial, Ms Quinn and C were both Crown witnesses. Ms Quinn's evidence was the main evidence upon which the principal Crown case, that the appellant, alone, had struck the blows to the deceased's head, was based. Ms Quinn refuted any suggestion that she had made statements of the kind alleged by C. The consequence of Ms Quinn's refutation of C's evidence was that the Crown was conducting its alternative case on a premise inconsistent with the evidence of the witness in its principal case. The appellant submitted that there was a tension, or at least a curiosity, in such an approach. Whilst that is true, it was a product of the Crown framing the alternative case against the appellant. The tension does not answer the question whether, on the evidence, there was a case of joint criminal enterprise to go to the jury. 

70The Crown case on joint criminal enterprise was based on the admission that C said Ms Quinn had made to her. The appellant's primary submission was that there was nothing in C's evidence that could constitute evidence of agreement or necessary involvement in the deceased's murder so as to sustain a case based on joint criminal enterprise. In order to determine whether this submission is correct, it is necessary to consider C's evidence in some detail. In this regard, it should be noted that the appellant did not contend that C's evidence-in-chief was different from her statement to the police in June 2003, but rather, that her evidence-in-chief was an incomplete version of what she had told the police. 

71C's evidence-in-chief was that Ms Quinn told her that there was a fight which got out of hand and Ms Quinn picked up the axe and hit the deceased with it. In cross-examination, C, in adopting the statement she made to the police, said that Ms Quinn told her she hit the deceased with an axe because the appellant and the deceased were hitting each other, and that Ms Quinn: 

""... didn't know what to do so she grabbed the axe and hit him in the head ... because she thought [the deceased] was going to kill [the appellant]."" 

72In my opinion, the appellant's submission should be accepted. There was no evidence to support a joint criminal enterprise. There was nothing in C's evidence that proved an agreement, express or tacit, or any assistance or encouragement either by Ms Quinn of the appellant or by the appellant of Ms Quinn. Rather, it was evidence of Ms Quinn reacting, independently, of her own initiative, to a situation in which she thought the appellant's life was in danger. C's cross-examination made even more explicit the independent basis upon which Ms Quinn acted. Accordingly, even if the jury accepted C's evidence that Ms Quinn struck a blow or blows with an axe, that evidence did not constitute evidence of a joint criminal enterprise as between Ms Quinn and the appellant. 

73It follows, therefore, in my opinion, there was no evidence of a joint criminal enterprise and the matter should not have gone to the jury on that basis and ground 1 of the appeal should be upheld. 

Grounds 2, 3 and 4: the trial judge's summing up 

74Grounds 2, 3 and 4 related to the trial judge's summing in respect of joint criminal enterprise. Ground 2 was advanced as an alternative to ground 1. Although I have concluded that ground 1 should be upheld, I propose to deal with the alternative ground, as grounds 2, 3, and 4 are closely linked. In those grounds, the appellant contended that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the narrow basis upon which the case on joint criminal enterprise was advanced; erred in his directions as to 'defence of another'; and erred in failing to direct the jury adequately on the subject and significance of Ms Quinn's alleged admission to C. 

75The appellant's contention as to the inadequacy of the directions to the jury was advanced on the premise that the Crown case on joint criminal enterprise was not based on any pre-concert. Rather, in the way the Crown conducted the case, any agreement or arrangement sufficient to ground a joint criminal enterprise had to be found, if at all, in the carrying out of the crime. This was reflected in his Honour's written directions provided to the jury which contained the following direction as to the alternative case based on joint criminal enterprise: 

""... each [of the appellant and Ms Quinn] was responsible, by their combined actions, for [the deceased's] death. That is that each of them was jointly responsible in law for the death."" 

76His Honour commenced his summing up to the jury on 8 June 2005. At the commencement of the next day, trial counsel submitted to his Honour that, having regard to the terms of Ms Quinn's alleged admission to C, the question of self defence, or, more accurately in this case, defence of another, had arisen. Trial counsel submitted, therefore, that it was necessary for his Honour, when directing the jury in relation to joint criminal enterprise, also to direct them that there was an onus on the Crown to negative that Ms Quinn had acted in defence of another. 

77When his Honour recommenced his summing up to the jury, he gave standard directions as to what was necessary for there to be a joint criminal enterprise, reflecting what was stated in Tangye. His Honour then dealt with that part of C's evidence where Ms Quinn had allegedly said, "" I didn't know what to do because I thought he was going to kill the [appellant] "". The trial judge then directed the jury as to defence of another in the following terms: 

""... if you were to come to the view that it is a reasonable possibility that Ms Quinn made the admission to C in the terms to which I earlier referred and also that the admission was a truthful and reliable representation of what occurred, then the Crown will not have established that there was a joint criminal enterprise between [the appellant] and Ms Quinn to intentionally kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, because it will not have excluded the fact, which it must, that Ms Quinn was acting in defence of another . The law treats defence of another in the same way as it does self-defence. Although 'self-defence' is referred to as 'defence' I direct you that the onus is upon the Crown to exclude it as an issue in this case . It may do so by proving beyond reasonable doubt one of two things, namely: that Ms Quinn did not believe at the time of doing her act or acts that it was necessary to do what she did in order to defend [the appellant]; or, if it is reasonably possible that she did have such a belief, that nonetheless the act or acts were not a reasonable response in the circumstances as she perceived them."" (emphasis added) 

78His Honour continued: 

""As I have said [trial counsel] urges you to accept the admission in its entirety. The Crown, as I have said, submits that you would certainly reject any suggestion that she was acting in defence of [the appellant]. Accordingly, the issue of self-defence, the Crown submits can be safely put to one side."" 

79Not long after the jury retired to consider their verdict, the trial judge received a note from the jury in which they sought clarification, inter alia, of the case based on joint criminal enterprise. 

80The re-direction commenced, relevantly, as follows: 

""... if you were to come to the view that it is a reasonable possibility that Ms Quinn made the admission to C in the terms to which I earlier referred and also that the admission was a truthful and reliable representation of what occurred, then the Crown will not have established that there was a joint criminal enterprise between [the appellant] and Ms Quinn to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, because it will not have excluded the fact which it must, that Ms Quinn was acting in defence of another."" 

No objection was taken by the appellant to this portion of the summing up. 

81His Honour then said: 

""The law treats defence of another in the same way as it does self defence. Although self defence is referred to as a defence, I direct you that the onus is upon the Crown to exclude it as an issue in this case. It may do so by proving beyond reasonable doubt one or other of two things. Namely that Ms Quinn did not believe at the time of doing her act or acts that it was necessary to do what she did in order to defend [the appellant], or if it is reasonably possible that she did have such a belief, that nonetheless the act or acts were not a reasonable response in the circumstances as she perceived them. 

Now as I have said [trial counsel] urges you to accept the admission in its entirety. This whole question of joint criminal enterprise in essence revolves around the admission. The Crown as I have said submits that you would reject it, and even if you were inclined to accept part of the admission, you would certainly reject any suggestion that she was acting in self-defence of the accused, and on that basis the Crown submits that the issue of self defence can be safely put to one side."" 

82The appellant contended that in directing the jury in these terms, the question of joint criminal enterprise became confusingly entwined with the directions in relation to defence of another, which related to Ms Quinn's state of mind, which was not relevant to the prosecution of the appellant. In the case against the appellant, it was only his state of mind that was relevant. 

83The appellant also submitted that this direction demonstrated the difficulty in the Crown's joint criminal enterprise case. Indeed, on the appellant's submission, the Crown case could be reduced to the following ad absurdum propositions: first, that the admission was not made, which was the primary way the Crown advanced the prosecution; secondly, if it was made, it was not true; thirdly, the admission was made and was true; and fourthly, the admission was made and was true except for that part of C's evidence where she had told the police that Ms Quinn had said "" I didn't know what to do because I thought he was going to kill [the appellant] "". 

84In my opinion, there was no error or inadequacy in his Honour's directions to the jury. His Honour explained to the jury that a joint criminal enterprise could be established by proof that another person was present and encouraged or aided the perpetrator in the commission of the crime. His Honour directed the jury, correctly, that if they accepted the entirety of C's evidence as accurate and truthful, the Crown would not have established that there was a joint criminal enterprise because the Crown would not have excluded the fact that Ms Quinn was acting in defence of another, namely the appellant. 

85His Honour also directed the jury, correctly, that the Crown could exclude that Ms Quinn was acting in defence of another, either by proving that she did not believe that it was necessary to do what she did to defend the appellant, or if she did have such a belief, she used excessive force, that is, her "" acts were not a reasonable response to the circumstances "". 

86No additional submissions were directed to ground 4. In my opinion, subject to the overriding difficulty that there was no evidence of a joint criminal enterprise, his Honour gave appropriate directions to the jury in respect of Ms Quinn's alleged admission to C. 

87It follows that I would reject grounds 2-4. 

Ground 5: failure by trial counsel to lead medical evidence as to the deceased's mental health and to cross-examine on material appearing in the medical records 

88The appellant submitted that that there had been a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6 because of the failure by trial counsel to adduce evidence that was central to his defence, namely, that he had been the victim of an attack by the deceased. The scenario sought to be advanced was that the deceased began to behave irrationally and was the aggressor in an altercation that followed and that Ms Quinn had inflicted the fatal blows when the deceased was about to stab the appellant. Ms Quinn was cross-examined to this effect, but she denied this version of events. 

89The appellant contended that there was information available that demonstrated the deceased had a history of violent and erratic behaviour when under the influence of alcohol and drugs and that this information should have been adduced in evidence in support of his case of provocation. The appellant contended, therefore, that a fundamental aspect of his case, that he had acted in response to a violent and irrational attack upon him by the deceased, was not placed before the jury. 

90The appellant submitted that the Mid Western Area Health Service records (the Service records), which were admissible as business records, should have been tendered: Evidence Act 1995, s 69. He also submitted that Dr Westmore and the persons whose statements he had relied upon to give his opinion should have been called to give evidence. The appellant also submitted that Mrs Muldoon should have been cross-examined as to the matters contained in the Service records, including his drug and alcohol abuse, the fact that he had been brought to the hospital by members of the family due to "" bizarre/dangerous behaviour "" and that according to the Service records she had reported to a Probation and Parole officer that she was "" a little afraid "" of the deceased. 

Evidence at trial as to the deceased's violent and irrational conduct 

91Evidence that the deceased was a heavy user of drugs, in particular marijuana and alcohol, and could become violent and irrational, was given by Adrian Selmes and Darren Harvey. 

92Mr Selmes was a former school acquaintance of the deceased. He gave evidence that he saw the deceased and the appellant at the public telephone box near the appellant's house late on the afternoon of 22 March 2003. Mr Selmes was cross-examined about his knowledge of the deceased's use of drugs. He agreed that when using drugs, the deceased would "" become agitated and aggressive "". Mr Selmes also agreed that, on a previous occasion, which appears to have been a reference to Ms Quinn's trial, he had given evidence that the deceased would have "" mood swings "", in which he would "" go from being a quiet and calm person to being a more agitated person quickly "". However, in re-examination by the Crown, Mr Selmes said that he did not know what a "" mood swing "" was. 

93Mr Harvey gave evidence that the deceased had stayed at his place on Friday 21 March 2003, the night before the murder. He said that they drank a bottle of Bourbon and smoked marijuana that the deceased had brought with him. He said that they smoked about 6 bongs each. They had also gone out at some stage during the night and bought a carton of beer, some of which they also drank that night. Mr Harvey agreed they were both "" pretty drunk "". He said they continued to drink the following morning and the deceased left Mr Harvey's residence "" just after lunch "" on Saturday, 22 March. 

94Mr Harvey had known the deceased for 14 years. In cross-examination, he agreed that there had been an incident some four or five years previously when the deceased had a screwdriver and made a stabbing action with it towards him. However, Mr Harvey contended that the deceased didn't threaten to stab him. Rather, he was waving the screwdriver around, motioning as though he was going to stab him. Mr Harvey said he "" knew the [deceased] wouldn't do it "", that is, stab him. Trial counsel asked Mr Harvey whether he agreed that "" after a while, [the deceased] calmed down "", to which he responded affirmatively. He also agreed that he considered that the deceased's behaviour was "" pretty paranoid "" and "" pretty irrational "" on that occasion. Mr Harvey said that the deceased had told him that he had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. 

95Karen Burley had had a relationship with the deceased during two separate periods of time and had three children with him. After her first separation from the deceased, Ms Burley had a six to eight month relationship with the appellant. She resumed her relationship with the deceased when the relationship with the appellant terminated. She and the deceased were together for about two years on the second occasion. Ms Burley said that the appellant said to her during this period that "" if he found out [she] was running around with [the deceased] again ... he'd get [the deceased] "". Ms Burley was not cross-examined about any drug or behavioural problems that the deceased had during their relationship. 

96Rose McCann, the mother of Mr Harvey and Ms Burley, had known the deceased for approximately 11 years. In her evidence-in-chief, Ms McCann said that about 5 or 6 years previously, Mr Cooper had "" told [her] that he'd get [the deceased]. It might take him years but when he did he'd be sorry "". Ms McCann agreed in cross-examination that the deceased had been a heavy user of drugs. She said however that she considered that the last few times she had seen him, around the time of his death, "" he seemed very clean, compared to what he was "". She was asked whether during the time he had been involved in drugs whether that had affected his personality. She responded, "" Well, I don't really know. Probably did "". 

97Mr Theobald was the taxi driver who delivered a cask of wine to the appellant's premises sometime between 4:30 pm and 5:30 pm on the night of the murder. Mr Theobald knew the deceased and said that on this occasion, when the deceased came out from the appellant's home to collect the wine, he observed him "" walking slowly and he appeared to be off his head on a mixture of drugs and alcohol "". Mr Theobald said that the deceased looked very different on this occasion as compared to times when he was sober. 

98The deceased's mother and grandmother disagreed, for the most part, that that the deceased had alcohol, drug, or other behavioural problems to any significant degree. 

99The deceased's mother, Fiona Phillips, gave evidence that the deceased had lived at his grandmother's house for a number of years. She said that she spoke to the deceased every few months. She said that although she and the deceased had had arguments, she had not observed him to have mood swings. In cross-examination, Ms Phillips was challenged as to her evidence as to the deceased's mood swings. Trial counsel reminded Ms Phillips that, in Ms Quinn's trial, she had responded "" yes "" when asked whether the deceased had mood swings. Trial counsel also reminded her that she had responded "" yes "" when asked whether the mood swings were erratic. Ms Phillips responded that she did not believe "" his mood swings were erratic with [her] anyway "". When further pressed by trial counsel on these matters, Ms Phillips said that she did not believe that she had "" said those things "" and she did not "" remember saying that "". Finally, she denied that the deceased suffered mood swings or that his behaviour was erratic. 

100The deceased's grandmother, Mrs Muldoon, gave evidence that as at March 2003, the deceased was living at her home and had done so for about 12 years. The last time that she saw the deceased was on the morning of Friday, 21 March 2003, when he went into Lithgow with his uncle for the purposes of collecting his social security payment. He did not return home that night, but that was not unusual, as he often stayed at the home of a friend on Friday nights. The deceased rang his grandmother early on Saturday morning, 22 March, and asked if his uncle could pick him up. His uncle was not available and the deceased said that he would catch the bus home and requested his grandmother to "" keep his tea for him "". The deceased did not arrive home and that was the last occasion that his grandmother spoke to him. 

101Mrs Muldoon denied that the deceased had mood swings. Apart from an occasion when the deceased had told her that someone "" was following him "" and he locked the back door, she said that he "" didn't have any other problem "". She knew that the deceased had received a visit from a member of the Area Health Service but she said she had been told by the Area Health Service on that occasion that there was nothing wrong with him. She agreed that, on occasion, his speech was slurred when he "" had a few drinks "". Trial counsel suggested to her that the incident when the deceased had locked the doors and said someone was following him had occurred three to four days before he last left her home, but she said that it was "" about three weeks before he left "". 

102The extent of the cross-examination of Mrs Muldoon, but more particularly, the matters upon which she was not cross-examined, emerged as one of the significant issues in this ground of appeal. I deal with that later. So far as the cross-examination went, it commenced with drawing Mrs Muldoon's attention to the visit to her home that had been made by the Service as follows: 

""Q. You're aware of a lady called Gwen -- 
A. Yes. 

Q. - alright, coming to your home and she introduced herself to you as somebody from the Local Area Mental Health Team? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And did she speak to you and [the deceased] about any medication that he was on at that time? 
A. He wasn't on any medication that I know of. 

Q. Did she tell you why she was visiting? 
A. He'd, he had been to the hospital, he'd been sick. 

Q. How had been sick, what did you -- 
A. He was sick in the stomach, something about that. 

Q. It wasn't the situation that he had become quite paranoid and gone into a psychiatric hospital for treatment? 
A. No he'd never been in a psychiatric hospital. 

Q. He didn't go to the Lithgow Hospital for treatment? 
A. He was in there for one night but he had no treatment. 

Q. And certainly Gwen described herself as being from the Mental Health Team when she came to visit you? 
A. Yes and she told me there was nothing wrong with [the deceased] at all. 

Q. Did you ask why she was there then? 
A. No I just thought it was a thing that, because he'd been in at the hospital that they did."" 

The cross-examination continued: 

""Q. Is it the situation Ma'am that [the deceased] used drugs to your knowledge? 
A. I haven't got a clue, he never did in our house or anywhere near our house so apart from that I would not know. 

Q. And Ma'am when you were speaking with your [grandson] this day that he locked up the house did you talk to him about that? 
A. I just asked him what was the matter and he said somebody was following him but he had his tea, went to bed and got up and was fine the next day. 

Q. Did you notice that there were occasions when his speech was slurred? 
A. Yes if he'd had a few drinks. 

Q. And is it the situation that this incident that you're talking about where he locked the doors and believed someone was following him occurred about three or four days before he left your home. 
A. No it was about three weeks before he left."" 

103Mrs Muldoon was not further challenged as to the deceased's mental state or violent tendencies as indicated in the Service records, to which it is now necessary to turn. 

Evidence the appellant said should have been adduced 

The Mid Western Area Health Service records (the Service records) 

104The deceased had been a patient of the Mid Western Area Health Service and, in particular, Lithgow Community Mental Health, from 2001. The Service records revealed that the deceased had presented at Lithgow District Hospital on 30 September 2001 "" with what appeared to be drug induced psychosis "". He presented at the Hospital again on 2 October 2001. On this occasion, he displayed "" some disorganised and tangential thinking "", which he himself attributed to "" a possible mild Schizophrenia "". 

105According to the Service records, telephone communication was made with his grandmother, Mrs Muldoon, who had indicated that she had been concerned about his health since he had returned to her home after a job had ended in April that year. His grandmother was agreeable to the deceased staying at her home and indicated she would strongly encourage him to continue treatment. The deceased's patient registration form of that date recorded a past history that he "" believes he may have Schizophrenia, no documented MH "" (the balance of this notation is illegible). There was also a history of substance abuse. 

106Under "" Details of Referral "", the following entry appeared: 

""Brought to [Lithgow District Hospital] by concerned family members. Drug induced psychosis. Bizarre/dangerous [behaviour]. Settled in hospital, [follow up] requested."" 

107Under "" History of Current Problem "", it was stated: 

""Client believes he has a mental illness. States he hears voices and realises his life is out of control due to unclear/disorganised thinking. Feels this has been happening for several years ... Uses drugs and alcohol, realises this exacerbates problems. Presented on 30/09/01 with drug induced psychosis at [Lithgow District Hospital] transported by family. Lives with grandmother, 3 children there as well."" 

108The deceased was negatively assessed as to harbouring ideas of harm to self or others. 

109The entry under "" Psychiatric Histor y"" read: 

""Reports he's felt mentally ill for years but has no formal [diagnosis]."" 

His symptoms were reported to be "" present for [about] 8 years "". Under "" Current Social Situation "": 

""accommodation w/ grandparents may be at risk if [behaviour] continues"" 

110His "" Current Level of Functioning "" was stated to "" [vary] with drug use "" and under "" Assessment of Strengths "" he was recorded as having "" some insight, motivation, good family support "". His thought processes were stated to be: 

""Somewhat tangential/loose associations, illogical thinking, generally able to communicate thoughts and respond to questions"" 

and his "" Perception "" as: 

""reports auditory hallucinations and probable delusions"" 

111The "" Preliminary Problem Formulation "" provided: 

""(1) detox, A + OD service provision 
(2) antipsychotic prescribed by GP Haran 
(3) family involved, educated, assist w/ med compliance 
(4) ongoing case management."" 

112Another entry dated 2 October 2001 noted that the deceased had a history of "" some verbal [aggression] occasionally "". 

113According to the Service records, Mrs Muldoon, attended Lithgow Hospital on 3 October 2001. The Service records noted a discussion with her in respect of the deceased's decline "" over the last six months and convinced him to minimise use of [drugs and alcohol] "". The Service records also noted that although the deceased was living with his grandmother, on most days he stayed with Michelle Walker, who was also a patient of the Service. 

114Mrs Muldoon had a further meeting with the Service on 8 October 2001. The notes of that meeting stated that the deceased's grandmother had given the deceased "" a few solid reality checks/examples of declining thought processes and functioning "". The notes continued: 

""Gave her our card and encouraged her to remain firm with [the deceased] re his behaviour and very specific without provoking him if possible. Phone the police immediately if any problems ..."" 

115On 22 October 2001, the Service records referred to an admission in "" [r]esponse to a new referral for mental health care "" and a "" Principal "" diagnosis of "" F91 "". This appeared to be a principal diagnosis of "" Conduct Disorder "". The "" Focus of Care "" was marked as "" Maintenance "" and, again, the deceased was recorded as being a voluntary patient. Under a heading "" Eligibility for Early Psychosis Intervention "", a negative response was given to the following pro forma statement: 

""The person is experiencing a possible or definite psychotic illness, within two years of their first registration with a specialist mental health service for this problem"" 

116A Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) was completed for the deceased on 22 October 2001, but this recorded him as having no or only minor problems with matters such as being "" overactive, aggressive, disruptive or agitated "", or having problems with drinking or drug taking, "" hallucinations and delusions "", or "" other mental and behavioural delusions "". 

117In a "" Self Report "" completed by the deceased, on 22 October 2001, which asked how the patient had been feeling in the previous four weeks, he ticked the box under the heading "" None of the time "" for seven of the ten questions, including questions about feeling tired for no good reason, feeling hopeless, feeling restless so as not being able to sit still, feeling depressed and feeling so sad that nothing could cheer him up. He ticked the box under the heading "" A little of the time "" for two questions, relating to feeling nervous and feeling restless or fidgety. He ticked the box under the heading "" Some of the time "" for the question, "" In the last four weeks, about how often did you feel worthless? "". The deceased was again reported as not meeting the eligibility criteria for "" Early Psychosis Intervention "". 

118Under a further entry in the Service records on 30 October 2001, there is a reference to the deceased's admission status as "" Voluntary "", the reason for referral being "" Assessment only ""; and to "" Verbal Outburst "". Other entries on this date are illegible. There was a notation that his insight into his condition varied as "" he struggles with being labelled psychotic "". However, the deceased was recorded as having "" much less marijuana and alcohol "" and was "" much more lucid and calmer "". On this occasion, there was "" no evidence of actual psychosis "". 

119On 4 October 2002, the Hospital received a referral from the Probation and Parole Service, which stated that the deceased was "" delusional and had paranoid thoughts "". He believed that "" someone poisoned him and [he] went into a trance "". The referral stated that he had reported hearing "" a voice in his head "". The Service had telephoned the deceased's mother, who said he was out for the day, but that he was "" OK. not going out much, but OK "". A follow-up consultation with the deceased on 8 October indicated that he was "" more settled and lucid "" but still "" slightly tangential with little ability to focus on a subject in depth "". The deceased did not attend an appointment that had been made for him on 17 October 2002. 

120There was another notation in the Service records at this time which assumed particular significance on the appeal. According to the Service records, the Probation and Parole officer reported to the Service that the deceased's grandmother had stated "" that she felt a little afraid of him due to his violence and erratic behaviour at times "". The Probation and Parole officer expressed her "" strong concerns as to his current mental/psychotic state "". The Probation and Parole officer was aware that the deceased was a patient of the Service and that he had seen "" Jeannette "" and asked whether "" Jeannette "" could contact her to discuss the matter further. Jeannette Brew, RN, returned the call and advised the Probation and Parole officer that she could see "" no current signs of psychosis "" and therefore there was "" no justification to continue seeing [the deceased] since he is not unwell at this time "". Nonetheless, the Probation and Parole officer requested that an assessment by a psychiatrist be organised. That was done, but the Service was unable to contact the deceased in the week prior to the appointment. 

121The next entry in the Service records was 22 October 2002, when it was noted that the deceased had been in gaol for nine months for a break-in, but that it was likely that the charges against him were dropped, as the circumstances surrounding the alleged events indicated that he was found sitting on the lounge in a house that he had entered because "" 'voices' in his head had told him to do so "". 

122The next Service record is dated 16 May 2003, when the Service provided a record to Police of its contact with the deceased, who at that stage had been reported as a missing person. The final entry was dated 19 June 2003, which recorded a local newspaper report that the deceased had been the victim of a murder on 22 March 2003. 

Dr Westmore's report 

123The solicitors for the appellant retained Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, to provide a "" personality profile "" in respect of the deceased. Dr Westmore provided a report on 13 May 2005. To enable him to prepare the report, Dr Westmore had been provided with the following version of events given by the appellant: 

""...[the appellant] felt [the deceased] had had a 'violent mood swing, was irrational and at the time of his attack on [the appellant], off his face, as attested to by a taxi driver Terrence George Theobold who delivered alcohol to the deceased only hours before his death."" 

124Dr Westmore was also provided with the following documents for the purposes of his report: NSW police criminal history and bail report of the deceased; the Service records; and statements of Fiona Margaret Phillips, the deceased's mother, dated 7 May 2003; Daphne Joyce Muldoon, the deceased's paternal grandmother, dated 10 May 2003; Darren John Harvey dated 9 May 2003; Paul Edward Bates, dated 15 May 2003; Michelle Walker, dated 16 May 2003; Bruce Butler, dated 15 May 2003; Russell Muldoon, the deceased's brother, dated 15 May 2003; Denise Fitzgerald dated 17 June 2003; and Terrence Theobold, the taxi driver, dated 27 May 2003. 

125Dr Westmore summarised these statements in his report. On the basis of the information provided, Dr Westmore offered a number of provisional diagnoses of the deceased, using the DSM-IV multi axial system. Amongst the provisional diagnoses, Dr Westmore included, under the heading "" Psychotic illness "", that based on the medical notes, the deceased had had psychotic experiences, including paranoid thoughts and auditory hallucinations and was described as having disordered thinking. 

126Dr Westmore stated that the differential diagnosis for the deceased's psychotic episodes would include a schizophrenic illness, possibly aggravated by drug use, or a drug-induced psychosis. Dr Westmore noted that the available notes suggested that the deceased "" suffered a number of psychiatric and psychological problems which were complicated by drug and alcohol abuse "". He also noted a history of the deceased "" becoming aggressive when intoxicated with alcohol and possibly with drugs and that he also became paranoid when using substances "". 

127Dr Westmore concluded in the final paragraph of his report: 

""The history contained in the various statements I have read would be consistent with the history given by [the appellant] and the collateral histories might support the proposition that the deceased was intoxicated with drugs and/or alcohol at the time he died and that the deceased was probably suffering from a recurrence of a drug induced psychosis just prior to his death. In view of the deceased's past history of becoming aggressive when drug and alcohol affected, then that may also support other aspects of [the appellant's] history regarding the deceased."" 

Information available from possible witnesses 

128To the extent that there may have been evidence available from other possible witnesses, it was only available to this Court in the form of summaries contained in Dr Westmore's report, of statements these persons had made to police. This material is discussed below in connection with trial counsel's evidence as to why she did not call any of these persons as witnesses at the trial. 

The conduct of the trial 

129The appellant contended that the forensic failure to adduce this material meant that there was little objective evidence of the deceased's mental state, which was integral to his version of events. If this material had been adduced in evidence, it would have demonstrated that the deceased suffered from a psychotic illness that made him prone to erratic and violent behaviour when under the influence of drugs and alcohol. This evidence would, on the appellant's submissions, have substantially strengthened his case. In particular, it would have rendered more likely the facts and truth of Ms Quinn's statement to C that the deceased had attacked him and would have supported the case on provocation. 

130Trial counsel gave evidence on the appeal explaining why she had not adduced evidence or cross-examined Mrs Muldoon, decisions of which complaint was made. That evidence was contained in trial counsel's two affidavits, sworn 2 March 2010 and 14 February 2011, upon which she was cross-examined. The appellant contended that trial counsel's evidence was unsatisfactory and would not be accepted by this Court. There is a further question as to whether the evidence was relevant in any event, given that the authorities indicate that the test for determining whether there has been a miscarriage when the underlying complaint related to the conduct of the trial, is an objective one. The question of both the reliability and the relevance of trial counsel's evidence is dealt with below. It is first necessary to consider the evidence. 

131In her affidavit of 2 March 2010, trial counsel stated, at para (3), that the Service records provided evidence of the deceased's alcohol and substance abuse and possible psychotic illness, but that the "" issue was to identify that there was 'violent' behaviour, and the nature and extent of it "". Trial counsel said, at para (17), that she had considered the tender of the Service records but had concluded that there were references in them in relation to the deceased that would not have assisted the defence case. 

132Trial counsel also said that the Crown prosecutor had informed her that if the Service records were tendered, the defence should expect further statements from the Crown relating to the deceased's mental state. Trial counsel understood that the additional evidence would come from a nurse whom the instructing solicitor, Mr Parkinson, had interviewed and who said that the reference in the Service records to "" bizarre/dangerous [behaviour] "" was a reference to the fact that the deceased would not eat, would become reclusive and would not attend to his personal hygiene. Trial counsel said she also understood from Mr Parkinson that the nurse had said that there were fears that the deceased was a danger to himself because of behaviour such as locking himself in his grandmother's shed, smoking cannabis and drinking for lengthy periods, not that he was dangerous to others. 

133Trial counsel stated that these matters were discussed with the appellant, who instructed her not to tender the Service records in those circumstances (para (18)). The appellant denied he gave any such instructions. 

134Trial counsel also said that she was concerned about the ethics of tendering those parts of the Service records in which there were references to the deceased's "" bizarre/dangerous [behaviour] "", as that may have been misleading and/or inaccurate. She said that she was not ultimately confronted with that ethical issue because of the decision, made with the appellant's instructions, not to tender the Service records (para (18)). 

135In her affidavit of 2 March 2010, trial counsel, at para (4), gave the following reason for not calling Dr Westmore: 

""A decision was made early on not to call Dr Westmore in the trial absent further material to support his provisional opinions. If anything was discovered this decision would have of course been revisited. The results of the enquiries made before and after the trial did not alter the earlier decision to refrain from calling Dr Westmore."" 

136In cross-examination, trial counsel said that the early decision made not to call Dr Westmore quite probably related to problems that she perceived in the Service records. She identified the 'problem' as being the possibility that the Crown would call evidence to explain the Service records. 

137Trial counsel also dealt with the question of calling witnesses to attest to the deceased's violent tendencies (para (9)). She said that the information available to her did not support that case and that the highest that the material reached, from investigating various witnesses, was that the deceased had told his grandmother to "" fuck off "". 

138Trial counsel had interviewed Mrs Muldoon prior to the trial. She said that Mrs Muldoon had presented as a simple, straightforward witness who had described the deceased as a meek and timid person who "" wouldn't hurt a fly "". Trial counsel said that she was concerned that cross-examination of Mrs Muldoon be handled delicately so that she would not be provoked into giving evidence about the deceased favourable to the Crown case. For that reason, she had not challenged Mrs Muldoon's evidence as to the nature or extent of the deceased's psychotic or violent behaviour more than she did (para (10)). 

139Trial counsel also said that Mrs Muldoon had denied in the interview that she was afraid of the deceased. Trial counsel said that when she asked Mrs Muldoon about the entry in the Service records as to her being "" a little afraid "" of the deceased, Mrs Muldoon she said that she was not personally afraid him. Rather, her fear was that he would be a danger to himself (para (13)). Trial counsel said that she did not cross-examine Mrs Muldoon as to the entry in the Service records for that reason. 

140Trial counsel, at paras (14)-(16) of her 2 March 2010 affidavit, explained why she had not called witnesses to attest to the deceased's violent and erratic behaviour. She stated that the appellant had provided a list of at least eight persons, additional to witnesses the Crown was proposing to call, who, on the appellant's instructions, would give evidence of various encounters with the deceased that demonstrated the deceased's violent and aggressive nature. 

141Trial counsel said that most of these persons were contacted and they variously described the deceased as "" insipid, ineffectual, weak, pathetic, timid and fearful "". She said that none of these persons had provided any evidence of violent or erratic behaviour by the deceased. By contrast, most of these persons said that they were fearful of the appellant and described him as "" a bully "" and "" aggressive, violent and threatening "" (at para (16)). 

142One of the named persons was Ms Walker, with whom the deceased had a relationship at around the time of his death. Ms Walker had made a statement to the police in connection with the deceased's death, which was part of the material provided to Dr Westmore for his assessment of the deceased's mental state. According to Dr Westmore's summary, Ms Walker described the deceased's violent conduct in some detail, including an occasion when he had bitten her and another incident where he had kicked a hole in the wall. However, the statement recorded that the deceased only assaulted her when he had been drinking and that when he drank he had a "" split personality "". Dr Westmore's summary stated that Ms Walker had taken out an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) against the deceased due to his violence. 

143The notes of the appellant's instructions at trial indicated that he had been insistent that Ms Walker be called as a witness and that this had remained a live issue as between trial counsel and the appellant until late in the trial. In cross-examination, trial counsel denied that she had merely refused (that is, without reason) to call Ms Walker as a witness. She said that Ms Walker was only located late in the trial and was, at that time, living out of her car. Ms Walker had indicated that she would not come to court. Trial counsel said that she also understood that if Ms Walker was called as a witness, she would say that her statement to the police was not true. Trial counsel also said that Ms Walker had a longstanding drug problem. 

144Trial counsel agreed in cross-examination that even if the persons that the appellant had wanted to call to give evidence did not support the appellant's case that the deceased was violent and aggressive, the question of the tender of the Service records was an entirely separate consideration, unaffected by what those persons might have said. However, trial counsel said that the overall strategy of exploring the background of the deceased was considered not to advance the issues in the trial in the interests of the appellant, although she agreed that her instructions were that the deceased was erratic, psychotic and potentially dangerous. Importantly, she also agreed that this was the case that she had to make in support of the appellant's defence of provocation. 

145By way of further explanation for not calling witnesses as to the deceased's violent and erratic behaviour, trial counsel said that she was concerned about asking questions of witnesses at the trial that would "" infer the deceased's bad character "". Counsel said that she advised the appellant of the consequences of doing so. Trial counsel also said in her affidavit of 14 February 2011, at para (11), that the Crown had initially proposed giving evidence of the appellant's alleged violent behaviour towards certain of the Crown witnesses, including Mr Denne and C, and also evidence of his violent relationship with Ms Quinn. However, that evidence had been ruled inadmissible during the course of pre-trial argument. She said that to the best of her recollection, the evidence was ruled to be not relevant to the issues at trial. Presumably, this was a further explanation of why she had not called witnesses to attest to the deceased's violent and erratic tendencies when drunk or affected by drugs. 

146Trial counsel explained that she was concerned with asking questions of witnesses where she was aware that prejudicial material would be elicited and that she advised the appellant "" of the effect of asking questions that inferred his good character and the consequences that might flow "". According to trial counsel, she was concerned as to the appellant's temperament and what the consequences would be if questions were asked that inferred the appellant's good character. 

147With respect to trial counsel, this involved a confusion of legal issues. The appellant wanted to agitate the deceased's tendency to be violent and irrational when affected by alcohol and/or drugs. Evidence of that would not have inferred the appellant's good character with the attendant risk of opening up the issue of his bad character. 

The appellant's evidence 

148As I have indicated, the appellant denied that he gave instructions not to tender the Service records or had agreed that they not be tendered. Indeed, his evidence was to the contrary, namely, that at all times he stressed to his legal advisers the importance of having evidence before the jury of the deceased's psychotic and violent behaviour. In support of the appellant's version, one of the appellant's handwritten notes of instructions to trial counsel was tendered on the appeal. It stated: 

""Lithgow mental health records in as a business statement. (With last entry edited out)"" (Exh F on the appeal) 

149In further support of his denial that he gave any such instructions, the appellant relied, inter alia, upon the fact that there was no note of any instruction to that effect. He pointed out that, in acting on his behalf, trial counsel had insisted on his giving written instructions in respect of matters he had wanted to raise and in respect of forensic decisions made in the conduct of the defence. Trial counsel gave evidence that she dealt with those notes by putting a line through them when a particular instruction had been dealt with. However, no written instruction was produced from the appellant that he had agreed that the Service records not be tendered. The appellant submitted that it would be highly unlikely that trial counsel would not have obtained written instructions from him in respect of such an important matter. 

150The appellant also said he was always determined that Dr Westmore be called as a witness in his case. He pointed out that he was aware, from Ms Quinn's trial, of the need to properly prove the deceased's mental instability and had sent an instruction to trial counsel at trial about this, which stated: 

""Judge Bell said to [counsel at Ms Quinn's trial] that questions relating to [schizophrenia] and mental illness had to be sourced from experts. 

This was raised in our cross examination of Darren Harvey who in his statement to police said [[the deceased] has been diagnosed with [schizophrenia]] Judge Bell objected when [counsel at Ms Quinn's trial] asked Darren about this. 

We may need to consider Dr Westmore as a witness or subpoena staff members from the Lithgow Mental Health Service. 

I think its important to establish [the deceased's] mental instability."" (Exh D on the appeal) 

151The appellant had a different recollection as to trial counsel's explanation for not calling the witnesses to give evidence of the deceased's violent and erratic behaviour. He said that trial counsel said to him: 

""I want a softly-softly approach"" 

and 

""We have to be careful about probing witnesses about the deceased's violence. It would open the doors for the DPP to introduce relationship evidence back into the trial."" 

152Trial counsel denied having made either of those comments. 

153The appellant also denied that he gave the name of eight persons to Mr Parkinson who could give evidence of the violent behaviour of the deceased. He said that the list of possible witnesses to the deceased's violence that was contained in Mr Parkinson's file notes was a reference to the people referred to in Dr Westmore's report, all of whom he said gave descriptions of the deceased's violent behaviour. 

154Mr Parkinson's file note (Exhibit C on the appeal) contained a list of 11 names, which, save for two names, corresponded with the list of persons referred to in Dr Westmore's report. This tends to support the appellant's version of this aspect of the evidence, but not conclusively so. However, there is other material that tended to indicate that the appellant's recollection on this issue is more accurate than trial counsel's. In particular, there is a significant correspondence between the appellant's evidence, that trial counsel warned him that relationship evidence would be brought back into the trial and counsel's statement that evidence of the appellant's violent relationship with certain of these witnesses was excluded in a pre-trial ruling. 

Reliability of trial counsel's evidence 

155As I have indicated, the appellant submitted that trial counsel's evidence was unsatisfactory. A number of bases were advanced to support this submission. The most significant related to her evidence that the appellant gave instructions not to tender the Service records, or agreed that they not be tendered. I have already referred to the appellant's evidence in support of his version that that he instructed trial counsel to tender the Service records and that he denied he gave instructions to the contrary. 

156The appellant also drew attention to the absence of any reference, in trial counsel's 2 March 2010 affidavit, to statements made by the Crown prosecutor that if the defence tendered the Service records, the Crown would call hospital staff to give evidence about the contents of the notes. The appellant submitted that if this had occurred, or was considered to be of any importance, it would be expected that trial counsel would have referred to it in her first affidavit. 

157For myself, I would not place much, if any, importance on this omission in the first affidavit. Trial counsel was being asked about a trial that had occurred some five years previously. In addition, at the time that she swore her first affidavit, not all the records of the Crown had been located. However, the other matters to which I have referred indicate that the appellant's recollection may be more reliable on the question whether he had instructed trial counsel not to tender the Service records. 

Deficiencies in conduct of trial 

158Quite apart from the challenge to the reliability of trial counsel's evidence, the appellant contended that there were deficiencies in her conduct of the trial that resulted in the trial miscarrying. The failure to tender the Service records, regardless of instructions, was critical to this submission. In addition the appellant criticised the manner in which trial counsel had cross-examined Mrs Muldoon. He submitted that whilst it might be expected that Mrs Muldoon would be supportive of her grandson, that was no reason, having regard to the contents of the Service records and, in particular, the reference in them that Mrs Muldoon was a little afraid of the deceased, not to challenge Mrs Muldoon in cross-examination on the deceased's violent and erratic behaviour when under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 

159The appellant also submitted that trial counsel's assessment of the evidence that the other witnesses might give as to the deceased's violent and erratic behaviour was a significant underestimation of the evidence likely to be available. For example, in cross-examination of Mr Harvey and Mr Selmes, trial counsel had obtained affirmative responses to her questions as to the deceased's violent and erratic behaviour. Given the statements that witnesses had given to police and which had been provided to Dr Westmore, the appellant submitted that it was at least possible, if not likely, that evidence of the same type would be elicited from such witnesses. 

160According to the appellant, the result of not adducing such evidence meant that the jury had been left without critical evidence of the deceased's mental state and violent tendencies. The appellant submitted, apart from any evidence that he might have given, had he been called, the defence case had only two things to support it. The first was Ms Quinn's admission to C, if it was accepted in its entirety, in which case the appellant would have been exonerated altogether. The second was the available material as to the deceased's violent and erratic tendencies, particularly as recorded in the Service records, but also available in the other material to which I have referred. 

161The appellant submitted that the failure to tender the Service records, in particular, meant that the appellant was deprived of half of the case that could have been put in his support. In addition, the failure to cross-examine Mrs Muldoon as to the reason for the deceased coming under the care of the Service in October 2001, was that the jury had been left with the impression that the deceased had gone to the hospital on that occasion because of a stomach ache. 

Legal principles governing counsel's conduct of a trial 

162Although the appellant submitted that trial counsel was an unsatisfactory witness, a submission which I have accepted in respect of the reliability of some of the evidence, it is also important to understand the extent to which evidence of a trial counsel as to why a trial was conducted in a particular way is relevant to the central question, which is whether the trial has miscarried. As Hayne J stated in TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [104]: 

""The miscarriage being said to lie in the fact that some evidence could have been, but was not, placed before the jury, the ultimate question will be whether the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about guilt if all the evidence had been before it. (I leave aside the debate revealed in Mickelberg v The Queen about whether the test is better expressed as 'likely to entertain a reasonable doubt' or 'significant possibility of acquittal'. I adopt the former expression only for ease of reference.)"" (citations omitted) 

163In determining this question, it is of assistance to understand that the question, whether a miscarriage arose due to counsel's conduct of the trial, arises independently of any irregularity in any of the procedural aspects of the trial, or misdirection by the trial judge, or of the verdicts being unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence; or any alleged error of law by the trial judge. 

164The application of the principle also requires an understanding of the nature of a criminal trial and the role of counsel in the trial. A criminal trial is an accusatory and adversarial process. The prosecutor and the accused's legal representative play their respective roles in that process by deciding "" the ground on which the trial will be fought and the evidence each will lead "": TKWJ per McHugh J at [74], Hayne J at [106]. 

165In the usual case, a party is bound by the way counsel has presented the case. In this regard, counsel is the client's agent and is usually instructed on the implied understanding that counsel is to have control over the way the case is conducted. As McHugh J noted in TKWJ , at [74], the discretion retained by counsel in the running of the case is very wide. Decisions have to be made in the course of the conduct of the trial, many of them difficult, and in respect of which minds might differ upon the preferred course to take. Accordingly, it is not relevant, or not necessarily relevant, to inquire whether counsel followed instructions: see McHugh J in TKWJ at [79]; Hayne J at [106]. 

166Because the question in issue is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice, when the ground of appeal relates to the conduct of counsel, attention is drawn to the result of the trial. This was explained in TKWJ . For example, Gaudron J, at [26], pointed out that the question whether there has been a miscarriage of justice is usually answered by asking whether the accused person was deprived of "" a chance of an acquittal that was fairly open "". The test is an objective one. Gaudron J explained this at [31]: 

""As in the case where there is a defect or irregularity in the trial, the reason why something occurred or did not occur is relevant to the question whether, in the circumstances, there was a miscarriage of justice. But the relevant question that must ultimately be answered, is whether the act or omission resulted in a miscarriage of justice, not whether, if it is referable to the course taken by defence counsel, it was the result of 'flagrant incompetence', 'egregious error' or the like."" (emphasis added) 

167Her Honour pointed out, at [33], that where it is claimed that a miscarriage of justice was a result of a course that was taken at the trial, the appellant must establish that that course was not the result of an informed or deliberate decision. Her Honour continued: 

""This he or she will fail to do if the course taken is explicable on the basis that it could have resulted in a forensic advantage unless, in the circumstances, the advantage is slight in comparison with the disadvantage resulting from the course in question."" 

168Hayne J also stressed that the essential condition for determination was whether there had been a "" miscarriage of justice "" and that consideration directed attention to the result of the trial. His Honour stated, at [103]: 

""There being no defect in the instructions given to the jury, and no defect in the procedures followed at trial, the question of 'miscarriage of justice' must in this case direct attention to the result of the trial. It is not enough to say, as the appellant submitted, that there was some procedure available at trial for deciding a question of admissibility of evidence which was a procedure trial counsel for the appellant did not invoke. That is significant only if it affected the result of the trial. Thus, if there is a miscarriage of justice, it lies in the fact that some evidence could have been, but was not, placed before the jury."" 

169McHugh J, at [77], also stressed the necessity of focusing upon the outcome of the trial: 

""..in - perhaps the majority [of cases]- the conduct of counsel - although irregular - will not necessarily deprive the accused of a fair trial. Not every error makes the trial unfair. Nevertheless, the irregular conduct of counsel may have affected the outcome. And a miscarriage of justice always occurs when there is a significant possibility that a material irregularity at the trial has resulted in the conviction of an accused person."" (citation omitted) 

170However, in a passage relied upon by the appellant, his Honour also considered, at [78], that it is not always necessary to show that the conduct of counsel resulted in an unfair trial. His Honour said, at [79]: 

""The critical issue in an appeal like the present is not whether counsel erred in some way but whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. However, 'whether counsel has been negligent or otherwise remiss ... remains relevant as an intermediate or subsidiary issue'. That is because the issue of miscarriage of justice in such cases ordinarily subsumes two issues. First, did counsel's conduct result in a material irregularity in the trial? Second, is there a significant possibility that the irregularity affected the outcome? Whether a material irregularity occurred must be considered in light of the wide discretion that counsel has to conduct the trial as he or she thinks best and the fact that ordinarily the client is bound by the decisions of counsel. Accordingly, 'it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence'. The appellant must show that the failing or error of counsel was a material irregularity and that there is a significant possibility that it affected the outcome of the trial."" (citations omitted) (emphasis added) 

171To this extent, his Honour's approach to the question was different from that of Gaudron and Hayne JJ. Gummow J agreed with each of their Honour's judgments. 

172The principle that applies when the complaint relates to counsel's conduct at trial was considered again in Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614. In that case, Gleeson CJ, at [10], stated that as a general rule, the focus in determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice should be on the objective features of the trial. His Honour considered, however, that there may be circumstances where it is relevant to know why some act or omission in the conduct of the trial occurred. In this regard, his Honour considered that it might be relevant to know whether a particular course was taken upon the client's instructions. As his Honour said, "" the possibility of a need to know the reason for conduct cannot be eliminated altogether "". However, his Honour emphasised throughout his reasons the importance of the objective nature of the standard to be applied. His Honour further stated: 

""[15] Because of the impossibility of predicting every form of misfortune or error that may result in a miscarriage of justice; because there are cases where an understanding of why something happened, or did not happen, may be material to a conclusion as to whether there was unfairness; and because such an understanding may reveal that there is no explanation for what occurred other than counsel's ineptitude or inexperience, courts of criminal appeal do not overlook the possibility that the conduct of counsel may result in such a failure of process that there is a miscarriage. 

... 

[19] The description of conduct as an 'error', and the characterisation of something that happened as ""unfair"", could in some circumstances turn upon knowledge of why something was done or omitted, and this, in turn, might reveal a departure from standards of professional duty. As Lord Carswell said in Teeluck v Trinidad , there may be rare cases in which counsel's misbehaviour or ineptitude is so extreme as to constitute a denial of due process to the client. McHugh J gave two examples in TKWJ v The Queen : cases where, for no valid reason, counsel fails to cross-examine material witnesses, or does not address the jury. (I take his Honour to have been referring to cases where there is no rational explanation of counsel's decision; not to cases where an appellate court simply thinks it was unwise to fail to cross-examine ..."" 

173In their joint judgment, Gummow and Hayne JJ, at [24], stated that the question whether there was a miscarriage of justice: 

""... requires consideration of what did or did not occur at the trial, of whether there was a material irregularity in the trial, and whether there was a significant possibility that the acts or omissions of which complaint is made affected the outcome of the trial."" (citations omitted) 

174Their Honours pointed out, at [25], that an appeal against conviction must ultimately focus upon the trial and conviction of the accused person. Their Honours defined the relevant question to be answered in terms, "" Was what happened, or did not happen, at trial a miscarriage of justice? "" Their Honours stated, at [27], that the enquiry is an objective one: "" the critical inquiry is what did or did not happen at trial, not why that came about "". 

175Kirby J endorsed the alternative "" fair trial "" approach indicated by McHugh J in TKWJ . 

176Callinan and Heydon JJ also referred to a fair trial. After noting that in TKWJ , Gaudron J and Hayne J considered that the inquiry as to the conduct of the trial was an objective one and whether, so viewed, as Gaudron J stated, "" the course taken by counsel was capable of explanation "", their Honours continued, at [158]: 

""In this case, on any assessment, whether subjective or objective, counsel's conduct was incompetent to a serious degree ... That is not however the end of the matter. Was the appellant's trial a fair one in all of the circumstances? Did justice miscarry to the extent that the appellant was deprived by his counsel's conduct of a chance of an acquittal? In answering these questions, we keep in mind that the more apparently serious the offence, the greater the need there generally will be for punctiliousness in all respects in the conduct of the trial."" 

Appellant's submissions on the appeal 

177The appellant accepted that, in considering whether there had been a miscarriage of justice it was appropriate to commence from the premise that the decision as to whether or not to adduce evidence and, in particular, to tender the Service records was a decision for counsel, regardless of the instructions he had given. He said, however, that a consideration of trial counsel's evidence was of assistance in determining whether or not the forensic decisions she made were objectively reasonable, or, to use the language of TKWJ , "" there could have been a reasonable explanation for not calling the evidence "". 

178As I have already indicated, there was no issue as to the admissibility of the Service records. Assuming relevance, they were admissible as business records. In my opinion, the Service records were relevant to the appellant's case, insofar as they supported C's evidence and the appellant's case on provocation. The Crown did not contend otherwise. Their importance to the appellant's defence is highlighted by the fact that there was no other medical evidence relating to the deceased's mental health and the manner in which that affected his conduct. 

179On the assumption that the Court's concern is as to what happened and not why it happened, the next relevant question is whether, as a result of the Service records not being tendered, the appellant lost an opportunity of an acquittal that was fairly open. That question cannot be answered immediately because the other matters upon which the appellant relied remain to be considered, all of which was directed to the one issue, namely, the deceased's potential to be violent and irrational when affected by alcohol and drugs. 

180However, before considering that other material, it is convenient to consider at this point whether this may be one of those cases where trial counsel's reasons for not adducing the Service records is relevant. In this regard, the appellant only relied upon trial counsel's reasons to the extent they cast light on the question, whether upon an objective assessment of the material, there was any reasonable basis for not tendering it. It will be recalled that trial counsel's principal reason for not tendering the Service records was that the Crown prosecutor informed her that if she did so, the Crown would call witnesses from the Hospital to give evidence as to the contents of the Service records and, in particular, the reference to "" dangerous "" behaviour meaning dangerous to the deceased himself. 

181Assuming that the Crown called such evidence, the Service records would still have been evidence that the deceased had a drug induced psychosis; was probably schizophrenic; that there was a report of "" bizarre/dangerous [behaviour] ""; that he had come under the care of the Service on a number of occasions for mental health reasons; and of Mrs Muldoon having stated that she "" felt a little afraid of [the deceased] due to his violence and erratic behaviour at times "". In my opinion, trial counsel's concerns do not provide a reasonable explanation for not tendering the Service records in circumstances where evidence as to the appellant's mental state and consequent behavioural tendencies was a central plank of the appellant's defence. 

182It is convenient to deal next with the failure to cross-examine Mrs Muldoon as to the deceased's violent and irrational tendencies. In this regard, the sequence in which evidence would have been adduced needs to be kept in mind. Mrs Muldoon was a Crown witness and her evidence would have been given prior to the Service records being tendered in the defence case. In the manner in which she was cross-examined, Mrs Muldoon had denied, or at least downplayed any mental health or drug or alcohol issues that the deceased had. She also had explained that the deceased had gone to hospital in October 2001 because of some stomach problem. That evidence made the tender of the Service records even more critical. 

183In dealing with the particular complaint made in respect of the failure to cross-examine Mrs Muldoon, therefore, it should be assumed that trial counsel intended to tender the Service records in the defence case. It should also be assumed Mrs Muldoon would be protective of her grandson's reputation and in particular that she would maintain, as she had said in conference with trial counsel, that she had said to the Probation and Parole officer she was a little afraid "" for "" the deceased, not "" of "" the deceased. 

184When a witness' evidence critically touches an issue in the trial, a mere concern that a concession in cross-examination may not be forthcoming from the witness is not a reasonable explanation for failing to cross-examine. On the assumption that the Service records were in evidence, a failure to cross-examine Mrs Muldoon on their contents would, almost certainly, have been the subject of adverse comment by the Crown to the jury. Accordingly, on an objective assessment, there was no reasonable basis for not cross-examining Mrs Muldoon on the issue of the deceased's violent propensities and her involvement with the deceased's care, as stated in the Service records. 

185I am also of the opinion that trial counsel's reasons as to why she did not cross-examine Mrs Muldoon do not withstand scrutiny and this may well be one of those cases, referred to by Gleeson CJ in Nudd , where it is material to know why a particular course was taken. If the subjective reasons do not withstand scrutiny, that may support the objective assessment that there was no reasonable basis for not taking a particular course at the trial. 

186The principal complaint in relation to the cross-examination concerned the entry in the Service records that Mrs Muldoon said that she was "" a little afraid of [the deceased] "". Trial counsel seemed to have accepted that what Mrs Muldoon had said at interview was correct, or would be her evidence, if cross-examined. But even on that version, Mrs Muldoon had not denied the reference to violence. Thus, a concern for him because of his violence would still mean that at least some history of the deceased's violence was in evidence. 

187Further, the Service records made other references to Mrs Muldoon's involvement in relation to the deceased's admissions. There were references to the possibility that his accommodation with her might be at risk if his behaviour continued, and that she had noticed a decline in him in the preceding six months before his first admission. There was also a reference to Mrs Muldoon being encouraged to remain firm with the deceased, taking care not to provoke him. A concern as to provocation is often, if not usually, accompanied by a concern about violence. This could have been explored in cross-examination. Accordingly, even had Mrs Muldoon denied or minimised the deceased's mental health and associated alcohol and drug problems, it is unlikely that such denials would have been fully accepted by a jury. 

188The question as to the calling of Dr Westmore and the various witnesses as to the deceased's violent behaviour can be considered together. According to the summary of the witness statements in Dr Westmore's report, the common thread in the statements was that the deceased had drug and alcohol problems. The only reference to violence in any of the statements came from Mr Harvey, who gave evidence, and Ms Walker. Leaving aside Ms Walker, given that there was no reference to violence in the statements of those persons, I am of the opinion that it was not unreasonable for trial counsel not to call the other persons referred to in Dr Westmore's report. There was already evidence before the court of the deceased's drinking and alcohol problems. These witnesses, at best, would only have confirmed that evidence and there was a risk that they would not have done so, having regard to what they had said in conference with the appellant's solicitor. 

189That left as the only apparent evidence of violence, any evidence that Ms Walker might give if called as a witness. According to trial counsel, Ms Walker said she would say that her statement to the police was untrue. Information of this nature would have posed some difficulties for a trial counsel deciding whether to call such a person to give evidence. The knowledge that Ms Walker had caused an AVO to be made against the deceased may not have advanced matters. Ms Walker may have denied knowledge of it or explained it away as relating to something other than physical violence, such as harassment or stalking. Having regard to those matters, it could not be said that there was no reasonable explanation for the failure to call Ms Walker, nor could that failure be characterised as an irregularity that affected the result of the trial. 

190This places the significance of Dr Westmore's report on a less solid foundation than might have been the case had there been witnesses to the appellant's violence or had Mr Harvey, in cross-examination, not downplayed the deceased's violent and erratic tendencies. It is apparent, from Dr Westmore's comment in the final paragraph of his report (see [127]) that his assessment of any possible violent tendencies of the deceased was dependent upon the histories contained in the statements of the other potential witnesses. As Dr Westmore indicated, if those histories were borne out, they might provide support for the appellant's version of what happened as provided to him. On the assumption that the witnesses were not called Dr Westmore's comment in the final paragraph of his report was unlikely to have had much traction with the jury, even assuming that it was admissible. In addition, Dr Westmore had reached his diagnoses of the deceased on a provisional basis only, given that he had not had the benefit of making a clinical appraisal of the deceased himself. 

191There is a real question, in any event, as to whether the opinion expressed in the final paragraph of Dr Westmore's report, which, as I understand the appellant's case, he would have sought to rely upon, would have been admissible. In the first place, it is doubtful whether the statement in the final paragraph qualified as a statement of an expert: see HG v R [1999] HCA 2; 197 CLR 414; Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; 52 NSWLR 705. In Makita , Heydon JA (as his Honour then was) stated, at [85], so far as is relevant to this case: 

""... if evidence tendered as expert opinion evidence is to be admissible, it must be agreed or demonstrated ... the opinion proffered must be 'wholly or substantially based on the witness's expert knowledge' ... so far as the opinion is based on 'assumed' or 'accepted' facts, they must be identified and proved in some other way ..."" 

192His Honour's statement reflected what had earlier been said in HG where Gleeson CJ, at [41], said that expert evidence: 

""... required identification of the facts [the expert] was assuming to be true, so that they could be measured against the evidence; and ... demonstration or examination of the scientific basis of the conclusion."" 

193The approach to s 79 in HG and Makita was approved by the High Court in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21, with an explanation of how the section operates in a case of a well-accepted area of expertise. The High Court (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said, at [37]: 

""It should be unnecessary, but it is nonetheless important, to emphasise that what was said by Gleeson CJ in HG (and later by Heydon JA in the Court of Appeal in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles ) is to be read with one basic proposition at the forefront of consideration. The admissibility of opinion evidence is to be determined by application of the requirements of the Evidence Act ... Accepting that to be so, it remains useful to record that it is ordinarily the case, as Heydon JA said in Makita , that 'the expert's evidence must explain how the field of 'specialised knowledge' in which the witness is expert by reason of 'training, study or experience', and on which the opinion is 'wholly or substantially based', applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded'."" (citations omitted) 

194It is also relevant in this case, when considering the admissibility of Dr Westmore's opinion, expressed in the last paragraph of his report that an expert's opinion must be supported by evidence, although it is not necessary that the evidence adduced at trial corresponds precisely with that upon which the opinion is based: see Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 58; 59 ALJR 844. 

195However, in this case, trial counsel would have been confronted with two problems if Dr Westmore was to be called to give evidence. The first was that there was not much independent evidence to support the proposition that the deceased was violent when drunk or affected by drugs. Mr Harvey modified his evidence in relation to any threat of violence from the deceased, as compared to the statement relied upon by Dr Westmore. And, as I have indicated, I consider that it could not be said that there was no rational basis for not calling Ms Walker. 

196However, even if I am wrong about that, it cannot be assumed that Ms Walker would have given evidence of the kind that Dr Westmore summarised in his report. Nor can it be assumed that evidence of the AVO would have been forthcoming or particularly supportive of a case based on a proclivity of the deceased to actual violence. Accordingly, it can be accepted that even if called as a witness, Ms Walker's evidence may not have had sufficient correspondence with that upon which Dr Westmore relied. It follows that the weight of any admissible evidence Dr Westmore may have given in relation to the deceased's violent tendencies is likely to have been diminished in any event. 

197The second problem that would have confronted counsel is a more fundamental one and is the one to which the principle in Makita is directed. As I have indicated, the essential point the appellant wanted to establish from Dr Westmore's evidence was the probability of the deceased having become violent whilst drinking with the appellant on the 22 March 2003. 

198It is not immediately apparent that Dr Westmore's opinion in the final paragraph of his report (set out at [127]), was admissible as an expert opinion. In particular, it is not apparent from the report that that opinion was "" wholly or substantially based on the witness' expert knowledge "": Makita at [85]. It was not suggested, for example, that a person with a mental illness such as schizophrenia would thereby be a person with violent tendencies. Dr Westmore's 'opinion' appears to be no more than an observation to the effect that a history of past violent behaviour when the deceased had been affected by drugs and alcohol, provided support for the appellant's version of events that he was violent on this occasion. Such evidence would not, in my opinion, qualify as expert evidence. 

199In any event, such an opinion was an assessment of a tendency, which in itself had implications for its admissibility, a factor upon which the Crown relied. Tendency evidence is governed by the Evidence Act , s 97 which provides relevantly: 

"" 97 The tendency rule 

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 

... 
(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value."" 

200The Crown submitted that Dr Westmore's opinion, in the last paragraph of his report, was arrived at without having made a clinical assessment of the deceased and was based on untested material provided to him. It further submitted that given the cautionary manner in which the opinion was stated, it did not have "" significant probative value "" for the purposes of s 97(1)(b). 

201I have already discussed the limited extent of material that supported the contention that the deceased was violent and erratic when drunk or affected by drugs. In my opinion, given the absence of any, or any significant, supportive evidence, it is unlikely that Dr Westmore's evidence of the deceased's likelihood of having become physically violent towards the appellant would be accepted as having "" significant probative value "". It is unlikely, therefore, that that aspect of Dr Westmore's evidence would have been admissible. 

Conclusions as to the evidence 

202The position I have reached in relation to the evidence that the appellant contended ought to have been adduced and the cross-examination of Mrs Muldoon that ought to have been undertaken, therefore, is as follows. I have concluded that there was no reasonable explanation for the failure to tender the Service records or for not cross-examining Mrs Muldoon, particularly in respect of the entry that she had said that she was afraid of the deceased's violent and erratic behaviour. 

203I consider that there was a reasonable explanation for not calling the witnesses who were said to be able to give evidence of the deceased's violent behaviour, as an analysis of their statements does not support that they would give such evidence. It is unlikely that Dr Westmore could give admissible evidence as to the likelihood of the deceased becoming violent towards the appellant on the occasion when he was murdered. Although his provisional diagnosis of drug and alcohol problems and possible schizophrenia would have been admissible, that opinion was only confirmatory of what was in the Service records. That was not the essential reason for the appellant wanting Dr Westmore called to give evidence. 

Was there a miscarriage of justice? 

204Having regard to these conclusions as to the evidence that should have been before the jury, the question that has to be answered is whether the failure to tender the Service records and to cross-examine Mrs Muldoon on the issue of the deceased's violence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. In other words, would a jury have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about guilt if all the evidence had been before it? 

205Had the Service records been tendered, then, in summary, the evidence before the jury would have been as follows. There was C's evidence that Ms Quinn had said that she struck the blow to the deceased's head and that as she did so the deceased was attacking the appellant. The references to violence and erratic behaviour in the Service records may have provided some support for this evidence. As explained earlier, C's evidence was not supported by the forensic evidence. A part of C's evidence as to what Ms Quinn had told her was contradicted by the forensic pathologist, viz : "" blood was spurting from his head "". At one point in her evidence, C was also uncertain as to what Ms Quinn had told her as to who hit the deceased with the axe. There was also evidence that the appellant was a larger man than the deceased, which may have caused the jury to consider that it was unlikely that the deceased had overpowered the appellant, as Ms Quinn's alleged admission intimated. Accordingly, there was cogent independent evidence indicating that C's evidence was unlikely to be true. 

206There was also Ms Quinn's evidence that the deceased had started to be irrational after he had been drinking for a while. The references in the Service records to the deceased having illogical thinking may also have provided some support for this evidence. However, it was also Ms Quinn's evidence that it was the appellant who used both the baseball bat and the axe and delivered all the blows to the deceased's head after the deceased started to be irrational and called the appellant a "" rock spider "". Although the jury was not bound to accept Ms Quinn's evidence, it is unlikely that they would not accept her evidence if they rejected C's evidence. 

207As to the failure to cross-examine Mrs Muldoon, assuming that she maintained that the deceased had been admitted to hospital in October 2001 because of a stomach problem, it is unlikely that her evidence would have been believed, given the contents of the Service records. However, this would not have advanced the defence very far. 

208Accordingly, notwithstanding the manner in which the trial was conducted, the appellant has not established a miscarriage of justice. In reaching this conclusion, I have excluded as a relevant omission the failure to call the appellant to give evidence, as no such omission was relied upon on the appeal. 

209It follows, in my opinion, that ground 5 of the appeal should be rejected. 

Ground 6: The prosecution was not entitled to rely on a case against the appellant based on a joint criminal enterprise with Ms Quinn, given her acquittal of the offence of murder prior to the trial of the appellant 

210The appellant submitted that the prosecution case based on joint criminal enterprise contravened the principle of incontrovertibility and was thus an abuse of process. He contended that as such, it resulted in a departure from trial according to law and consequently resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 

211The starting point for this submission was that Ms Quinn's trial for murder was based upon a joint criminal enterprise with the appellant and that she was found not guilty. The appellant submitted that Ms Quinn's acquittal meant that there was no joint criminal enterprise between Ms Quinn and the appellant to murder the deceased: Washer v The State of Western Australia [2007] HCA 48 per Hayne J at [113]. 

212The appellant contended that the consequence of bringing a case that he was guilty of murder on the basis of a joint criminal enterprise with Ms Quinn had the effect of seeking to controvert her acquittal and that was proscribed by the principle of incontrovertibility. The appellant contended that the principle of incontrovertibility is not limited by a precondition that the issue must arise as and between the same parties: cf the doctrine of issue estoppel in civil proceedings. 

213The appellant submitted that the joint criminal enterprise alleged in his trial was manifestly inconsistent on the facts with Ms Quinn's acquittal. He contended that the joint criminal enterprise case relied upon in his trial sought to retry the issue that was central to Ms Quinn's trial for murder. 

214In my opinion, this ground of appeal fails for two reasons, one of fact and one of principle. 

215As to the question of fact, it is necessary to understand the basis of the Crown case against Ms Quinn. 

Ms Quinn ' s trial 

216On 27 September 2004, Ms Quinn was indicted before Bell J on one count of murder and one count of intent to pervert the course of justice by the acts of disposing of the body of the deceased and cleaning the premises where he was murdered. Ms Quinn pleaded not guilty to each count. The appellant was indicted at the same time before Bell J on identical counts. As already indicated, the appellant pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to the count of doing acts with intent to pervert the course of justice. The trial proceeded as a joint trial until 29 September 2004, when Bell J ordered separate trials and the jury was discharged from giving verdicts in respect of the appellant. Ms Quinn's trial continued before Bell J. 

217In Ms Quinn's trial, the Crown case was that Ms Quinn had struck the deceased on the head with the axe with an intention to kill or to inflict serious harm. The injury thus inflicted was injury number 1 and, on the evidence of Dr Little in Ms Quinn's trial, was a potentially fatal injury. Initially, it was the Crown case in Ms Quinn's trial that the other injuries had been inflicted by Mr Cooper with the baseball bat and that injury number 4 was also potentially fatal. 

218The appellant contended that the case put to the jury in Ms Quinn's trial was one of joint criminal enterprise. 

219The Crown submitted that the prosecution case against Ms Quinn was not based upon any agreement with the appellant to kill or seriously injure the deceased. The Crown pointed out that although in her instructions to the jury in Ms Quinn's case, Bell J used expressions including "" joint attack "" and "" joint assault "", at no time did her Honour use the expression "" joint criminal enterprise "". In particular, her Honour did not, according to the Crown, use that phrase in her summing up to the jury, nor did she give any direction to the jury explaining the concept of joint criminal enterprise. 

220The Crown also submitted that there was evidence in Ms Quinn's trial upon which a jury might well have based their decision to acquit her. In particular, the case against Ms Quinn was based solely upon the evidence of C. Ms Quinn gave evidence in her defence. Her evidence was the same as she gave in the appellant's trial, namely that the appellant, unprovoked apart from the deceased calling him a "" rock spider "", hit the deceased with a baseball bat a number of times and then a little later hit him with the axe. 

221The Crown submitted that if the jury did not accept the truth and accuracy of the admission that C said Ms Quinn made to her, then, inevitably, there would have been an acquittal. The Crown pointed out that in Ms Quinn's trial, C had not given her evidence with any great certainty. In cross-examination, C stated that she was "" pretty sure "" she had a conversation with Ms Quinn in relation to the blood on the ceiling and how it got there. She conceded, however, that she could have had that conversation with the appellant. 

222In re-examination in Ms Quinn's trial, C said that all that she could remember was Ms Quinn telling her that the deceased and the appellant had had a fight and "" then there was an axe and -- and he got hit with the axe "". She said she was "" pretty sure I heard [Ms Quinn] say she was the one that hit [the deceased] with the axe "". When asked to recount the conversation she had with Ms Quinn as best she could, C said, "" I don't know, I can't remember ... I don't even know if it was [Ms Quinn] or [the appellant] telling me any more "". 

223The Crown submitted that having regard to this evidence, it was possible that the jury could not be sure whether it was Ms Quinn or the appellant who relayed to C the information about the axe being used. If that were so, they could not be satisfied that it was Ms Quinn who had used the axe. The Crown also submitted that it was possible that the jury was not satisfied that Ms Quinn had the necessary intent for murder or might have considered that she had come to the appellant's aid. 

224The point of the Crown's explanation of possible reasons for Ms Quinn's acquittal was to demonstrate that there were bases in the evidence for an acquittal, but that the acquittal was not based upon the rejection of a case based on joint criminal enterprise, because no such case was run. 

225An examination of the transcript of Ms Quinn's trial confirms the Crown's submission that Ms Quinn's trial was not based on a joint criminal enterprise with the appellant. At the conclusion of the evidence on 7 October 2004, Bell J asked the Crown and Ms Quinn's counsel what directions to the jury they considered were required. Her Honour also raised with the Crown prosecutor "" the way the Crown puts liability for murder "". The Crown prosecutor responded: 

""Your Honour, if she didn't hit him, we haven't proved it ... Is that put simply enough your Honour?"" 

226After further discussion with his Honour, it was apparent that there was more complexity in the Crown case than encompassed in that response. The Crown said that the case was one of joint assault in which two significant injuries had been inflicted, that is injuries number 1 and 4, each of which had the potential to be fatal. The Crown indicated to her Honour that the jury did not have to be satisfied as to which blow was the fatal one. The Crown then stated that its case was one of "" joint criminal liability "" in respect of which both Ms Quinn and the appellant were liable as principals. 

227Her Honour indicated that, in addition to directing the jury that Ms Quinn had inflicted the fatal blow, she would give an alternative direction that there was a "" joint assault "" involving Ms Quinn and the appellant; that Ms Quinn participated in that assault by striking the deceased with an axe; and that the joint assault reflected an understanding, albeit tacit, that "" at least grievous bodily harm would be inflicted "". Both the Crown prosecutor and Ms Quinn's counsel accepted that this was an appropriate direction to be given to the jury. Such a direction would have been a direction that Ms Quinn and the appellant had engaged in a joint criminal enterprise. 

228The terms of the directions were not finalised at that stage and the matter was adjourned to 11 October 2004. When the matter resumed on that day, her Honour again raised the question of the directions to be given to the jury. She handed to the Crown and Ms Quinn's counsel a copy of written directions she was proposing to give to the jury. Her Honour referred first to the direction she proposed to give in relation to the Crown case that Ms Quinn had delivered a blow to the head with the axe which substantially contributed to the deceased's death. 

229Still in discussion with counsel, her Honour turned to the alternative basis upon which she understood that the Crown put its case and said: 

""... you will see that I have set out the elements including that both [Ms Quinn] and [the appellant] had an intention in participating in the assault, to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased, together with [Ms Quinn's] knowledge of what it was that [the appellant] was doing and her awareness that he was possessed of that intention."" 

230After raising an unrelated issue, her Honour continued: 

""... I take it Mr Crown, it is the Crown's wish to leave it also on the alternative basis of a joint assault in respect of which she aided and abetted [the appellant]."" (emphasis added). 

The Crown prosecutor responded: 

""It is at this stage your Honour but I may say this, as I reflect on what I say, I reflect on what my friend says, I may again -- or your Honour may feel inclined to revisit the matter even if I don't raise it with your Honour."" 

Her Honour responded "" yes "" to this statement. 

231As I understand this submission and her Honour's affirmative response, the Crown prosecutor was indicating that if he did not take up in his address to the jury the alternative basis that had been discussed, he would expect that her Honour would not direct the jury on any alternative basis. In his address to the jury, the Crown prosecutor did not suggest that there was any alternative basis upon which Ms Quinn's guilt should be considered, nor did Ms Quinn's counsel direct attention to any alternative case. 

232In her Honour's summing up to the jury on 12 October 2004, she directed the jury as follows: 

""Turning then to the first count which is the charge of murder. The way the Crown puts its case is that [Ms Quinn] was involved in a joint assault upon the deceased with [the appellant]. It is the Crown's case that in the course of that joint assault upon [the deceased], [Ms Quinn] struck the deceased to the head with an axe or hatchet thereby occasioning the injury that is described by Dr Little as injury number one, the injury to the top of the head to the right of the midline or centre line of the head. It is the Crown case that that injury significantly contributed to the death of the deceased and that at the time [Ms Quinn] struck him to the head with the axe or hatchet, she intended either to kill him or to do him grievous bodily harm. That is the way the Crown puts its case ... 

The elements of the offence of murder that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt are firstly, that the deceased died as a result of head injuries inflicted with blunt force during the course of an assault on him. Secondly that the accused inflicted one or more of the injuries that caused the death of the deceased by striking him on the head with an axe or hatchet. And I emphasise that is the Crown case. If you are not satisfied that she participated in that assault by striking to the head with an axe or hatchet, the Crown has not proved an element that is essential to proof of its case. The third element is that at the time of striking the deceased with the axe or hatchet, it was the accused's intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased ... 

Now returning to the elements of the offence and for present purposes to element number two, it is important to understand that the Crown does not have to prove that it was the sole act of [Ms Quinn] that caused the death of the deceased. It is, as I have emphasised, the Crown case that this was a joint assault and that [the appellant] struck a blow or blows to the head of the deceased, it is the Crown case that [the appellant] struck the blow that caused injury number four and as I have said to you, that was first in time and according to Dr Little, itself a potentially fatal injury. 

It is sufficient for the Crown to prove that [Ms Quinn's] act in striking the deceased to the head with an axe or hatchet, significantly contributed to his death. The concept of significantly contributing to death includes the concept of accelerating the process of death if you were to consider that had been put in train by [the appellant] with the first blow that caused injury number four. 

The only evidence that is capable of establishing that [Ms Quinn] was involved in the infliction of any of the fatal violence on the deceased, is the evidence of [C] and that is [C's] evidence that sometime on the afternoon of Sunday 23 March ... [Ms Quinn] said to her words to this effect, '[the deceased] came around and him and [the appellant] started having a fight and then she got the axe and hit him with the axe'. I am there quoting [C's] evidence of what it is she said [Ms Quinn] told her. She went on to say that she had asked [Ms Quinn] about the stains that she observed on the ceiling and that [Ms Quinn] said, 'It was where the blood had spurted'. She was asked if [Ms Quinn] has said what caused the blood to spurt and she replied, 'From where she cut his face with the axe'. 

I emphasise that there is no evidence apart from [C's] account of that conversation that is capable of proving that [Ms Quinn] was involved in the assault upon the deceased that led to his death. It is the Crown case that you would accept [C] as being accurate in the recall of the conversation and that you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when [Ms Quinn] said those things to [C] she was being truthful ... 

The central issue in this case as I am sure you well appreciate members of the jury, is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was [Ms Quinn] who struck the deceased with the axe or hatchet. And I will come back to that and remind you a little more fully of the evidence of [C] in due course."" (emphases added) 

233Her Honour then dealt with the element of intention for the purposes of murder on the basis of the case upon which she had directed the jury. In particular, she directed the jury that: 

""... where a specific result is the obvious or inevitable consequence of doing an act and a person goes ahead and does the act, you may readily conclude that he or she did the act with the intention of achieving that result."" 

234The following day, her Honour stated that she had completed her directions in respect of the elements of the offence of murder and then turned to the elements of the offence of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice. Her Honour did not, at any stage, give a direction as to any alternative basis of the murder count, either in the terms she had discussed with the Crown prosecutor and Ms Quinn's counsel on 7 and 11 October 2004, that is, that Ms Quinn had aided and abetted the appellant, or in respect of a joint criminal enterprise. There was no mention of pre-concert, or of agreement, or of assisting or encouraging the appellant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime: see Tangye at 556-557 referred to at [66] above. 

235Accordingly, the fundamental factual basis upon which the appellant sought to base his argument on incontrovertibility has not been made out. The appellant did not seek to make out any other basis upon which the principle applied and for that reason alone this ground of appeal should be dismissed. 

236The Crown also submitted that the principle of incontrovertibility, as it has been expressly developed to date, has not been applied as between different accused. The Crown submitted that this was understandable, because the principle was unlikely to have application as between different accused, as the factual and legal issues in relation to an individual accused in a different trial will necessarily be different. 

237This was easily demonstrated, on the Crown's submission, by reference to the requirement that the necessary intention for a particular offence in most cases is subjective. Any verdict in which Ms Quinn's mental state at the time she struck the accused was in issue, could not be binding, in the sense of being incontrovertible, on the question of the appellant's mental state at the time he struck the accused. The Crown also submitted that whilst Ms Quinn was entitled to the full benefit of her acquittal, the appellant was not correspondingly entitled to a benefit from that acquittal. The appellant had not been placed in double jeopardy by being tried for the murder of the deceased on the basis of joint criminal enterprise, in circumstances where another accused had been acquitted of the murder of that person. 

238Although the metes and bounds of the principle of incontrovertibility remain undetermined: Gilham v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 323; 178 A Crim R 72 per McClellan CJ at CL at [149], I am of the opinion that the better view is that the principle does not avail a co-accused. Rather, it applies in respect of a later charge against an accused who has been acquitted of another crime. In R v Carroll [2002] HCA 55; 213 CLR 635 Gleeson CJ and Hayne J stated: 

""[40] There are cases where a charge of an offence would be manifestly inconsistent on the facts with a previous acquittal, even though no plea of autrefois acquit is available. Since, in most cases of trial by jury, it will not be known why the accused was acquitted, and in many cases the reason may simply be that the jury had a doubt about whether the prosecution had established some element of the offence, the inconsistency, if it exists, will appear from a comparison of the elements of the new charge with the verdict of not guilty of the previous charge, understood in the light of the issues at the first trial."" 

239In Carroll the accused was acquitted of murder but was later charged with perjury. Their Honours continued: 

""41 The present case provides an example. The only element of the offence of murder that was in issue at the original trial of the respondent was whether he killed Deidre Kennedy. The perjury alleged at the second trial consisted of the respondent's falsely denying, on oath, that he killed Deidre Kennedy. The falsity of the testimony was claimed to be that he said he did not kill Deidre Kennedy whereas in truth he killed her. It was accepted in argument in this Court that, although it was not expressly averred, it was necessarily implied in the perjury indictment that the respondent had killed the child. 

42 In the present case, there was manifest inconsistency between the charge of perjury and the acquittal of murder. That inconsistency arose because the prosecution based the perjury charge solely upon the respondent's sworn denial of guilt. The alleged false testimony consisted of a negative answer to a question, asked by his counsel, whether the respondent killed the child. The fact that the question asked was whether the respondent killed Deidre Kennedy rather than whether he murdered her, or whether he was guilty, is immaterial. Discretionary decisions do not turn upon such differences. Once such manifest inconsistency appeared, then the case for a stay of proceedings was irresistible."" 

240In the same case, Gaudron and Gummow JJ stated: 

""86 The interests at stake in a case such as the present ... touch upon matters fundamental to the structure and operation of the legal system and to the nature of judicial power. First, there is the public interest in concluding litigation through judicial determinations which are final, binding and conclusive. Secondly, there is the need for orders and other solemn acts of the courts (unless set aside or quashed) to be treated as incontrovertibly correct. This reduces the scope for conflicting judicial decisions, which would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Thirdly, there is the interest of the individual in not being twice vexed for one and the same cause. Finally, there is the principle that a cause of action is changed by judgment recovered in a court of record into a matter of record, which is of a higher nature."" (citations omitted) (emphasis added) 

241McHugh J considered, at [117], that it was sufficient if, in that case, the subsequent charge for perjury "" had a tendency to undermine the respondent's acquittal of an earlier charge of murder "". 

242His Honour continued: 

""118 ... The long established policy of the law is that an acquittal is not to be contradicted or undermined by a subsequent charge that raises the same ultimate issue or issues as was or were involved in the acquittal. That is so even though the evidence proving perjury is unanswerable. 

... 

138 ... For the purposes of the criminal law, the entry of an acquittal on the charge of murdering [the deceased] was a final judicial determination that Carroll did not kill her. Under the common law, that determination could not be directly challenged or undermined in or by any subsequent criminal proceeding."" 

243A principle stated and explained in these terms does not readily apply to co-accused. That is apparent from the reference to "" autrefois acquit "" and to the comparison of the elements of the new charge against the verdict of not guilty of the previous charge in the judgment of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J; to the juridical factors underlying the principles referred to by Gaudron and Gummow JJ, at [86], and in particular, the reference to the first and third of those factors; and to the reference in McHugh J's statement, at [118], that an acquittal was not to be contradicted or undermined by a later charge that raises the same issue or issues as were involved in the acquittal. 

244There are indications in the authorities that, in addition to the principle of incontrovertibility, a wider principle based upon abuse of process may operate in certain circumstances, where the focus is not upon whether the accused is charged with a later offence, some essential element of which has been determined by an earlier verdict for a different charge. See Rogers v R [1994] HCA 42; 181 CLR 251; Garrett v R [1977] HCA 67; 139 CLR 437. 

245However, in Carroll Gleeson CJ and Hayne J noted, at [47]: 

""Whether Rogers or Garrett should be understood as standing for some wider proposition need not be decided, although it may be accepted that there may be cases where a second prosecution is argued to be oppressive and an abuse of process, even though there is no direct inconsistency between the new charge and the earlier verdict. The circumstances that may constitute oppression or an abuse of process are various. The discretionary considerations that may be relevant in dealing with them cannot be rigidly confined. Nevertheless, where it is said that the abuse lies in seeking to controvert an earlier verdict of acquittal, there appears much to be said for the view that it is necessary to direct attention to the elements of the offence of which the person was acquitted and the elements of the offence with which the person is later charged. Seldom, if ever, will considering whether the later charge controverts an earlier acquittal require attention to whether evidence which would be led at a second trial is new or persuasive."" (citation omitted) (emphasis added) 

246The appellant did not seek to rely upon some broader principle of abuse of process. Ground 6 was based solely upon the principle of incontrovertibility. The appellant's case on that basis was predicated upon the murder charge against Ms Quinn having been prosecuted on the basis that she was guilty as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise. I have concluded that that was not the basis upon which the jury was asked to determine Ms Quinn was guilty of murder. For that reason alone, this ground should be dismissed. 

247I am also of the opinion that there is no support in the authorities for the legal proposition that the appellant advanced, namely, that the principle of incontrovertibility applies as between different accused persons. Nor does any wider principle of abuse of process extend to a case such as this. It is not unusual where there are separate trials of co-accused for one accused to be acquitted and another or others to be convicted. The reason for this is to be found not only in the jury's assessment of the evidence, but, more fundamentally, in the fact that one of the essential elements of the crime in each case, namely, the intention of the accused, is different. This is well explained by the example proffered by McHugh J in Osland , at [79], referred to at [63] above. 

248For these reasons, I would reject ground 6. 

Is this a proper case for the proviso? 

249The appellant submitted that if any of his grounds of appeal succeeded then the appropriate order was that there be a new trial. I have concluded that ground 1 should be allowed. However, the Crown submitted that even if any of the appellant's grounds of appeal succeeded this was a proper case for the application of the proviso to the Criminal Appeal Act , s 6(1). Section 6(1) provides: 

""The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. "" 

250The statutory task to be undertaken in respect of the proviso was considered by the High Court in Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300. Their Honours (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ) said, at 316-317: 

""41 That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence[56] and determine whether, making due allowance for the 'natural limitations' that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record[57], the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty ... 

44 ... No single universally applicable description of what constitutes 'no substantial miscarriage of justice' can be given. But one negative proposition may safely be offered. It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. 

45 Likewise, no single universally applicable criterion can be formulated which identifies cases in which it would be proper for an appellate court not to dismiss the appeal, even though persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt. What can be said, however, is that there may be cases where it would be proper to allow the appeal and order a new trial, even though the appellate court was persuaded to the requisite degree of the appellant's guilt. Cases where there has been a significant denial of procedural fairness at trial may provide examples of cases of that kind."" 

See also Washer per Kirby J at [101]. 

251I have already referred to the evidence in some detail and to the competing versions of the attack upon the deceased given by Ms Quinn and by C. The unlikelihood of C's evidence being correct is underscored by Dr Little's evidence. On Dr Little's uncontradicted evidence, there were no fractures and no lacerations to the deceased's face, which was the part of the body that C alleged Ms Quinn had said she had hit. Dr Little also gave evidence that there were no blood vessels in that part of the body from which blood would spurt and therefore spray onto the walls and ceiling. It will be recalled that C not only said Ms Quinn said that blood had sprayed onto the wall and ceiling, but also that she had seen a stain on the wall and ceiling. 

252It will also be recalled that Ms Quinn gave evidence that the appellant punched the deceased several times. Ms Quinn's evidence was corroborated in this regard by the evidence of her son, J, who said that he saw the appellant punch the deceased, and also by C and Mr Denne, each of whom said that the following day they noticed the appellant's knuckles were swollen. J's evidence differed in some respects from other evidence given by Ms Quinn, C and Mr Denne, particularly in relation to the time and sequence in which people came and went from the house on the night of 22 March and the following morning. However, those matters were incidental to the events of that night. J's recollection that he saw the deceased being punched was not challenged in cross-examination. 

253Dr Little gave evidence that there was no bruising to the deceased's face. That evidence is referred to at [56]. It is not clear from the cross-examination whether the questions were intended to relate to the deceased being hit on the face with an axe or other implement, or whether it related to the deceased being punched. However, the question was cast in terms of the deceased having received ""s ignificant blows "" to the face, which would seem to indicate that the question was directed to him being hit with an implement. Dr Little's reply would also seem to indicate that that was her understanding. 

254The Crown also relied upon the fact that there was no evidence of any defensive injuries on the deceased's body, indicating that the attack upon him occurred suddenly, as Ms Quinn had stated. 

255Finally, the Crown relied upon the fact that the evidence suggested that injuries 2-4 and 4 in particular, had been caused by a baseball bat. There was no suggestion in the evidence or in the case advanced by the appellant in cross-examination of Ms Quinn that anybody else had used the baseball bat. The probability was also that a baseball bat was used, given that both Mr Denne and C gave evidence that the handle of a baseball bat was sticking out from the hessian bag the appellant removed from the house and threw onto the fire at the tip. 

256In my opinion, when the whole of the evidence is considered, the case that the appellant at least struck the blow that caused injury number 4 is such, that notwithstanding I have concluded that ground 1 should be upheld and that the Service records should have been tendered and Mrs Muldoon cross-examined as explained under ground 5, there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice within the meaning of the proviso to s 6(1). 

257Accordingly, I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 

258HIDDEN J : I agree with the order proposed by Beazley JA and with her Honour's reasons. 

259As to ground 5, like her Honour, I acknowledge the difficulties faced by trial counsel in giving evidence about tactical decisions made in a trial she had conducted some 5 years previously. In the event, I agree with Beazley JA that the way in which the trial was conducted did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. 

260As to ground 6, I agree that the principle of incontrovertibility was not engaged for the reasons identified by Beazley JA. What the scope of that principle might be is not a matter this court is called upon to decide, and I would prefer not to express a concluded view about it. 

261R A HULME J : I agree with Beazley JA.

		15 December 2014",2011-12-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708812,MRW v R [2011] NSWCCA 260,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: The appellant was tried before a jury at Taree District Court on two counts: 

""(1) Between 15 July 2002 and 15 August 2002 at [T] in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] a person over the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years and who was under the authority of [MRW] (section 66C(2) Crimes Act 1900) 

and 
(2) On or about 25 December 2002 between [W] and [T] in the State of New South Wales did assault [the complainant] and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon [the complainant] in circumstances of aggravation (section 61M(1) Crimes Act 1900)"". 

2The jury convicted the appellant on the first count, but acquitted him on the second. 

3The complainant is the daughter of the appellant. She was aged 10 years and two months at the time of the offence for which the appellant was convicted and aged 17 when she gave her evidence at the trial. 

4The appellant appealed against conviction, the only ground being that a miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at the trial of fresh evidence. The appellant also appealed against sentence. 

5As the appeal on conviction does not relate solely to a question of law, the appellant required leave to appeal both against conviction and sentence: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5(1). The appellant did not seek leave to appeal against conviction, however, no point concerning this was taken on the hearing of the appeal. 

The conviction appeal 

6Before turning to the fresh evidence it is convenient to consider the evidence presented to the jury at the trial as the effect the fresh evidence may have had on the jury needs to be considered in that context. 

7At trial, the prosecution case was dependent on the evidence of the complainant as to both incidents, and also relied heavily on the corroborating accounts given by the complainant's aunt, MH, and mother, FW, of having been told about the first incident by the complainant in 2002 and 2008 respectively. 

First count: complainant's evidence 

8As to the first incident, the complainant's evidence (given by CCTV) was that she was at home watching TV with her siblings when the appellant asked her for a massage. They went alone to the bedroom, where she massaged him for 15 to 20 minutes, after which she asked for the appellant to massage her. The complainant said that while massaging her, the appellant ""started massaging my insides of my legs and started massaging my groin and then he moved my underwear to the side and started to play with my vagina and then slipped his fingers into my vagina"" (appeal book 138). She said he moved his fingers in and out of her vagina more than once, and that: 

""after the sixth, seventh time I was just like 'Can you stop' and he's just like 'Why' and I'm just like 'Please stop' and he's just like stopped and he's like 'What did it feel like' and I said 'Oh it feels like, I don't like it' can like yeah and he said 'Don't you like it, it's supposed to feel good'. 'No it's not, it didn't'."" (appeal book 139) 

9She gave evidence that after he stopped they sat on the floor of the bedroom and had the above conversation, during which he also said ""'If you keep going' or 'You do it again I'd get you stuff, I'd buy you stuff' yeah and 'Let you go to your friends' houses'"" (appeal book 140). 

10The complainant gave evidence that she told first her aunt, in 2002, and then her mother, in 2008, about the first incident. These accounts will be set out below along side the respective accounts given by her mother and aunt. 

11The complainant also gave evidence that on the day following the first incident, she intentionally banged her head against a brick wall at school, and was stopped by a teacher and questioned, but did not disclose the incident to her (appeal book 141). The teacher gave evidence that she did not recall this and that such an incident would have been worthy of an incident report (appeal book 225, 333). 

12The complainant also gave evidence that in 2003 or 2004 her mother asked her if her father had ever touched her and she said ""No, he hasn't done anything to me mum I promise"" because the appellant ""was in the same room with us and he gave me evil eyes"" and ""I was too scared to say"" (appeal book 186-187). 

13The complainant also gave evidence that she did not resist her father or seek help immediately after the incident because she was afraid of getting in ""heaps of trouble"" or being ""flogged"" (appeal book 141). 

First count: complainant's mother's evidence 

14The complainant's mother also gave evidence by CCTV. She corroborated the complainant's account of being asked by her if the appellant had ever ""touched you on the rude part"" in 2004 (appeal book 218). It conflicted to a minor degree with the complainant's account of being asked by her mother, in that the complainant recalled that the appellant was in the room, but her mother recalled that he was not in the room but was nearby and ""probably would've heard me say it"" (appeal book 219). 

15The complainant's mother also gave evidence corroborating the complainant's account of telling her mother about the first incident, over the telephone in 2008. According to the complainant, in October 2008 she told her mother about the first incident over the phone ""and dad was going off in the background, saying that I'm a lying bitch, that's not true"" (appeal book 174). The complainant's mother said that during the phone call the appellant yelled into the phone receiver: ""You're a lying little bitch and I'll have you for defamation of character"" (appeal book 219). The complainant's mother then recounted an argument that took place with the appellant following the conversation, in which the appellant allegedly stated: ""Yes, well I must've fucked her, yes I must've done it, well okay are you happy. I fucked her. I done it"" (appeal book 220), and then ""Are you happy now?"" (appeal book 223). 

First count: complainant's aunt's evidence 

16The complainant's aunt gave evidence corroborating the complainant's account of recounting the first incident to her. 

17According to the complainant, around July 2002 she was at her aunt's place (appeal book 142): 

""We were having a swim and that, and Aunty [XX] had asked me something before I hopped in the - hopped in to have a swim, she asked me, 'What's up with you, [XX], you look upset today?' I said, 'Oh nothing's wrong, Aunty [XX], nothing's wrong.' So she said, 'Okay, girls, go hop in and have a swim,' so I was just like okay then, so we all jumped in and had a swim and I was just like swimming around, like started feeling upset now so I hopped out and went up over to Aunty [XX] and said, 'Aunty [XX], I've been lying to you, I need to tell you something' and she said, 'Yes, okay, come with me,' so we went - I went with her and we went into her bedroom. 

... 

Into her en-suite and then she was just like 'Now, what's wrong, darl, are you going to tell me something' and I was just like, 'Yes,' and she's like, she's like, 'Well, go on then, come out with it' and I told her and I said that Dad had sexually abused me, he had touched me, yeah. 

... 

I said that Dad had - what I exactly said to her, I said, 'Dad had a massage - asked me for a massage and I gave him the massage and then I asked for a massage and I gave him a - like, he gave me the massage and then started playing with my vagina' ... "" 

18She was then examined as to the events that followed (appeal book 143): 

Q. So on the day that you told Aunty [XX] you were still living with the accused your father, is that right? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. After you told Aunty [XX] and she went somewhere, did you see the accused? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Where did you see him? 
A. He came to Aunty [XX]'s house and come and got us - us kids. 

Q. How was he when you saw him? 
A. He was fuming, real cranky, going off. 

Q. Did he say anything to you about - or did he say anything to you? 
A. Yes, he said that, 'Why have you been opening your big, fat mouth, lying, you know not to lie,' blah, blah, blah, carrying on screaming, like you couldn't really understand him, but you could hear him say, like- 

Q. Was that in front of Aunty [XX]- 
A. Yeah. 

Q. -when he was doing that? 
A. Yeah, and he - he also said that, 'You shouldn't believe what your aunty says and you shouldn't believe anything else,' and just screaming at the top of his lungs. 

19The complainant's aunt gave evidence that the complainant came to her house for a swim during the school holidays in July 2002. A document titled ""Daily Meteorological observations for [the area of the complainant's aunt's house]"" was in evidence, indicating a temperature range in July of 2002 of between 13-21 degrees C. According to the complainant's aunt, the complainant was there without her brother and sister, and swam with the complainant's aunt's daughters (appeal book 197-199): 

Q. Did you say something to [the complainant]? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did you say? 
A. I asked [the complainant] was anything wrong. 

Q. Did she answer? 
A. She said 'Everything's all right Aunty [XX]'. 

... 

Q. Did you go to work that day? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you return to make the girls some lunch? 
A. Yep. 

... 

Q. Did you speak to them when you returned? 
A. I went out the back and yelled out Mum's home. 

Q. Right, and what happened then? 
A. [The complainant] got out of the water and come up to me. 

Q. What happened then or what did you see about [the complainant] when she came up to you. 
A. She had a towel - the end of the towel was in her mouth. 

Q. In her mouth? 
A. Chewing on them. 

Q. Was that something you'd seen her do before? 
A. No. 

Q. What happened then? 
A. She asked to see me. 

Q. Yes. Can you remember what she said, the words she said? 
A. 'Can I see you Aunty [XX]?' 

Q. Okay, and did you answer? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did you say? 
A. I said, 'Can you go to the kids bathroom?' 

Q. She said, 'Can I go to your bathroom Aunty [XX]?'? 
A. I said 'Yes continue up to the hallway'. 

... 

Q. Has she ever done that before, asked to go to the bathroom in your room? 
A. No because my - no. 

... 

Q. At some stage did she say the words to you, 'I've got something to tell you Aunty [XX]?'? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did you say when she said 'I've got something to tell you Aunty [XX]?'? 
A. I said to [the complainant], 'What's wrong? Has Daddy done something?' and [the complainant] said 'Can I tell you?' and I said 'Yes' and she told me. 

Q. What did she tell you? 
A. Said her daddy were massaging and - do I have to tell you, yes? Her daddy were massaging and her dad put fingers in her Mary Ellen which, in my case, is a vagina. I've taught my kids to say Mary Ellen. 

Q. Okay. After she said that did you say something? 
A. Yes. I said to [the complainant], 'Are you sure [XX] this happened? This is a big accusation to make against your dad'. 

Q. Did she answer? 
A. Yes. She said she's sure. 'I'm sure Aunty [XX]'."" 

20The complainant's aunt then gave evidence of leaving the complainant at her home and driving to the appellant's house and saying to him: ""You put your finger up [the complainant] while she was massaging you"" (appeal book 200). She gave evidence that he replied with words to the effect of: ""I never touched [the complainant]"", and ""I fucking didn't. I'll have you up for defamation of character. Get off my property"" (appeal book 200). The complainant's aunt said that she then returned home, and the appellant arrived at her home shortly after. She gave evidence that the appellant yelled at her, called for the complainant and took the complainant home with him (appeal book 201). 

21In cross examination, the complainant was asked: ""What I'm asking you is whether you told Aunty [XX] that he asked for a massage or 'massaged daddy for a long time and he put his finger in my Mary Ellen'?"" The complainant replied, ""I didn't say it like that to her"" (appeal book 176). 

22The complainant's aunt gave evidence that she did not tell the police about the incident but she told DOCS. She said she did not follow it up with DOCS (appeal book 204). 

Second count: complainant's evidence 

23As to the second count, the complainant gave evidence that on the way home from visiting her grandmother on the evening of Christmas Day 2002, she fell asleep in the front seat of the car driven by the appellant. She said she awoke with her skirt pulled up and the appellant's ""hand rubbing on my leg and like playing with my vagina, over my underwear"" (appeal book 150). She said she pretended to be asleep for five to ten minutes before turning her head to look at the appellant, at which point he stopped. The complainant was cross-examined about an inconsistency between her evidence at trial and her police interview, namely that she told police in the interview that she: 

""was asleep and I was in one of those half sleeps, where you can still feel and hear everything, and like when I felt it, I like woke up and like woke, the kind of woke up, just opened my eyes a bit and turned me head, and then I opened me eyes fully and then he moved his hand away real quick"" (appeal book 186), 

as opposed to having pretended to be asleep. The complainant agreed that these accounts were different, but also said: ""Well half asleep is like, what I felt was like, I was awake but I wasn't fully awake, I felt him doing it, and as soon as I felt him like, realised I opened my eyes, and yeah"" (appeal book 185). This inconsistency was relied on heavily by counsel for the defence in his address to the jury. 

24The complainant gave the following evidence in cross examination (appeal book 173-174): 

""Q. Do you remember, you've told us you talked to Aunty [XX] and you told her something in 2002 right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Do you remember talking to Aunty [XX] in 2007 and talking to her about this incident in the car? 
A. No. 

Q. It's not a situation that you said to Aunty [XX], you wouldn't believe it Aunty [XX] I woke up and dad had his hand down my pants and he was fingering me while you were driving in the car travelling to [W]? 
A. I didn't say that to- 

Q. You didn't say that to Aunty [XX]? 
A. No I only told her about the one on the bed. 

Q. You didn't have a conversation when you went to [G] to do some shopping? 
A. No. 

Q. I'll be specific. You told her that he did something during a Christmas visit to your Nan's in [W] and you were driving in the car travelling to [W]. Did you tell her you were travelling to [W] when it happened? 
A No I didn't tell her that that happened at Christmastime. I didn't tell her anything about that incident."" 

25The complainant was asked on re-examination whether she would describe the second incident to anyone as ""fingering"". She agreed that she would not have described it this way (appeal book 190). 

Second count: complainant's aunt's evidence 

26The complainant's aunt gave the following evidence at trial in relation to a visit with the complainant in July 2007, which was admitted only as to the complainant's credibility (appeal book 205): 

""Q. And did [the complainant] say something to you about an incident that occurred at Christmas time? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And she told you about an incident that occurred in a motor vehicle being driven by her father? 
A. Correct. 

Q. Was the fact of the matter that [the complainant] said that that happened while they were driving to [W]? 
A. Yes. 

Q. That's the important part. To [W], not from [W] to [T]. Yes? 
A. She just said they were on their way to nan's. I don't know if they were coming back or on the way. I was just told. 

Q. I'll refer you to your statement, paragraph 20. 'On the way back to [the complainant's mother's] house from shopping [the complainant] told us that while they were driving in the car, travelling to [W], [the complainant's siblings] were asleep in the back seat. [The complainant] said she was asleep in the front seat.' That says driving to [W]? 
A. Yes, yes. 

Q. You said that she said to you 'You wouldn't believe it Aunty [XX], I woke up and dad had his hands down my pants and he was fingering me'? 
A. Yes. 

Q. That's the words she used 'he was fingering me'? 
A. Yes."" 

27The complainant's aunt's statement to police (reproduced at appeal book 86) was in evidence, and gave a detailed account of this alleged conversation. The complainant's aunt said that the complainant made the above statement in a car with the complainant's aunt, the complainant's aunt's husband and their two children, on the way home from shopping. Her statement continued: 

""21. I said, 'Can you come back with us and I'll take you to the [F] Police Station to report it. [The complainant] said she was too scared but I know she wanted to come with us. When we got back to [the complainant's mother]'s place [the complainant's aunt's daughter] helped [the complainant] pack her bags so she could come with us. That's why we decided to leave the next day. I didn't want to stay near that prick another night. 

22. At the time we left [the complainant] got really scared and said, 'I can't do it Aunty [XX], I can't do it.' [The complainant] made me pinky promise that I wouldn't tell anyone before I left. I wanted to report it to [G] police on the way but I knew [the complainant] was terrified of her father. We left and returned to [F]."" 

28The only other evidence at trial came from the officer who interviewed the complainant and arrested the appellant. She gave evidence as to this, and noted that after identifying herself to the appellant, he said: ""This is about [the complainant], isn't it?"" (appeal book 235). 

29During the course of her summing-up the trial judge directed the jury that it could accept part and reject part of the evidence of the witnesses. She referred to the fact that the complainant's evidence was that she told her aunt about the first incident but not the second, contrary to the evidence of her aunt. She referred to the differences between the evidence of the complainant and that of her aunt in the conversation in which the complainant said she told her about the first incident. She referred to the evidence of the complainant that on the day following the incident she banged her head against a brick wall at school and the evidence of the teacher, Ms Watson, to the effect that she did not recall the incident but that had it occurred it would have been worthy of an incident report. 

30Her Honour emphasised that the Crown case largely depended on the acceptance of the reliability of the complainant. She referred to the statement of counsel for the defence that the differences between the complainant's and her aunt's version of the conversation at which the first incident was recounted were significant. She stated the jury had to decide whether the aunt's evidence supported what the complainant said she told her and that if it did it may increase the weight to be given to the complainant's evidence. 

31Her Honour further told the jury that if they found the appellant not guilty on either count, particularly if it was because of doubts concerning the reliability of the complainant's evidence, then they would have to consider how that consideration or conclusion affected their consideration of the other count. 

32The jury retired to consider its verdict at 11.10am on Friday, 7 August 2009. They requested and were given a transcript of the complainant's evidence, and a copy of the complainant's aunt's statement to police. They also requested a copy of the complainant's statement to police, but they were not given this as it was not in evidence. 

33At midday on Monday, 10 August 2009, a jury note indicated they were unable to reach a decision as to either count and believed they would not reach a decision given more time. Three hours later the jury sent another note with words to the effect of: ""Do we have to stay here forever?"" (appeal book 52). On the morning of Tuesday 11 August 2009, the jury requested a copy of the complainant's aunt's evidence. They received it at 10.44am. They returned a verdict of guilty to the first charge and not guilty to the second charge just after 2.00pm that day. 

The fresh evidence 

34The fresh evidence consisted of an affidavit of JM, the mother of the appellant. In an affidavit affirmed on 16 May 2011, she gave the following evidence: 

""6. On Monday, 21 September 2009 at 7.15 am, [MH, the complainant's aunt] telephoned me. We had the following conversation with words to the effect: 

[MH] said: 'I am ringing you about [MRW's] court cases, the ones at [F] and [T]. Both of my statements for courts were made up between [FW, the complainant's mother], [the complainant] and me. I just went along with what [FW] and [the complainant] told me. Is [MRW] appealing against the case?' 

I said: 'I don't know but I don't think so.' 

7. [MH] then started crying on the phone and said words to the effect: 

'He got 25 years for nothing. Please tell [MRW] that I am so sorry. I took [the complainant's siblings] to [C] prison to see him because they have been asking for their father but they wouldn't let me in. [FW] and [the complainant] are bad on drugs and running amok in [F]-[T]. [The complainant] is living with a 27 year old man.' 

... 

10. Immediately after the conversation with [MH], I wrote down our conversation. I then spoke to my partner and my daughter. On the same day I rang and left a message for Alex Donne, who was [MRW's] solicitor at the time of the trial to call me. I cannot recall now when he returned my call, but I do recall saying to him ' I have some information from [MH].' Alex said to me ' Don't talk to me. Send it in a letter.' 

11. I then wrote to Alex Donne. I have been shown a handwritten letter by me dated 5 October 2009 and I recognise that as the letter I sent to Alex Donne. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter 'A' is a copy of that letter."" 

35The letter which is annexure A to the affidavit repeated what was in par 6. Relevantly it stated: 

""On Monday 21.9.09 at 7.15am [MRW]'s wife's sister rang me referring to [MRW's] court cases. The one at [F] and [T]. She stated that both court cases were made up between [FW], [the complainant] and herself. She said she only went on what they told her ... She then broke down crying on the phone and said he got 25 years for nothing ... She stated that [FW] and [the complainant] were bad on drugs and running amok in [F]-[T] ... After that conversation she rang me back at midday wanting to know where [MRW] was ... She made these 2 phone calls from [a] payphone. She then gave me her mobile to ring her back."" 

36Paragraph 6 of the affidavit was admitted as evidence of the conversation, not as evidence of the truth of its contents. Similarly, the letter which is annexure A was not admitted as truth of the representations contained in it. 

37During the course of the appeal each of MH and JM gave evidence and were cross-examined. During the course of her cross-examination MH agreed she had two conversations with JM on 21 September. It was put to her and she denied the conversations did not concern the wellbeing of JM's grandchildren. She rejected the proposition that she did not tell JM that there had been a drug raid on the home of FW (the appellant's former wife) and that as a result she (FW) had been deemed an unfit mother stating that that was why she (MH) had custody of JM's grandchildren. In the course of her cross-examination, she was asked the following questions (the references are to the transcript of the appeal): 

""Q. What I'm suggesting to you that in the second conversation you had with [JM] again there was no discussion with respect to the wellbeing of the children? 
A. Yes there was."" (at T10.15 - T 10.20) 

and 

Q. What I'm suggesting to you is that the purpose of the phone calls to [JM] on 21 September had nothing to do with the wellbeing of those children and that's simply a lie made up by you? 
A. No it's not. 

Q. In fact the purpose of the phone call on 21 September was for you to confess to [JM] that you in cahoots with [the complainant] and [FW] had made up your statement to the police with respect to [MRW]. 
A. No. 

Q. Are you sure about that? 
A. One hundred per cent."" (at T10.35 - T10.46) 

38And she gave the following additional evidence: 

""Q. [JM's] affidavit indicated, did it not, that you told her that [FW] was on drugs and running amok around [F]-[T]. That wasn't a lie, was it? 
A. She was running amok. 

Q. Yes, and you told [JM] that, did you not? 
A. Yes."" (at T 12.5 - T 12.11) 

and 

""Q. But you disagree, I take it, that what you also told [JM] in that phone call was that you, along with [FW] and [the complainant], made up your statements with respect to [MRW]? 
A. Never. 

Q. Never said that? 
A. Never ever. 

Q. Do you agree madam that in that conversation with [JM] you said to her that [MRW], 'He got 25 years for nothing'? 
A. No because I didn't know he had 25 years."" (at T12.20 - T12.31) 

39At the conclusion of her evidence she was asked the following questions (at T 13.5): 

""Q. You see what I'm suggesting to you madam, as I have already, is on 21 September 2009 you made a confession to [JM] that you'd fabricated your evidence in cahoots with [the complainant] and [FW]? 
Q. No. 

Q. And the basis for that confession was that you knew there was rumours around town letting everyone know precisely what the three of you had done? 
A. No."" 

40In her evidence in chief, JM denied she had any conversation concerning the wellbeing of her grandchildren. She stated she had a clear recollection of what was discussed between herself and MRW on 21 September 2009. 

41In cross-examination JM gave evidence that she had had a number of strokes over the previous ten years and her memory was not as reliable as it used to be. She agreed that sometimes she could not remember, or might not quite understand what was going on. She said she wrote important matters down and that she wrote her conversation with MH on a piece of paper which she had not been able to find. During the course of her cross-examination she gave the following evidence: 

""Q. Your younger grandchildren, [R] and [J], they live with [MH] now, don't they? 
A. Yes, yes. 

Q. But you haven't had any contact with them for quite some time, have you? 
A. No. 

Q. Are you still interested in their lives? 
A. I'd very much like to see them but [MH] said they're not allowed to be seen unless we have legal - have to go to Court to see them. 

Q. It's the case, isn't it that when [MH] called you in September 2009, you wanted to find out how the kids were going, didn't you? 
A. No, they weren't mentioned at all, the children."" (at T17.31 - T17.45) 

42However, she subsequently gave evidence that the children were in fact mentioned: 

""Q. [JM], it's the case isn't it that when [MH] called you on 21 September, she told you that she had the younger children in her custody, didn't she? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And she told you that they were doing okay? 
A. No, I don't think she mentioned any more about it. 

Q. So are you telling the Court that she just rang you up and told you that she had the children and that was that? 
A. Yeah, but that wasn't what she rang me up for I feel. 

Q. That's not my question. Is it your evidence that [MH] simply called you up and said, I've got the children and nothing more about them? 
A. No, she was ringing up about the case. 

Q. She also told you that the children were doing okay at school, didn't she? 
A. I don't think that was mentioned. 

Q. And she told you that [FW] was not well and she couldn't look after the children at that time, didn't she? 
A. No. 

Q. Is it possible that you've forgotten that part of the conversation? 
A. I don't think so. 

Q. What makes you think that you haven't forgotten it? 
A. I don't know. 

Q. In relation to [MRW's] case, what [MH] actually said to you was that there were rumours going around town that [FW] and [the complainant] had made up the allegations, isn't that right? 
A. Yes."" (at T19.16 - T19.49) 

and 

""Q. [MH] also gave you her mobile number in that conversation, didn't she? 
A. That's right. 

Q. And she said - she gave that to you so that if you wanted to call the younger children you could? 
A. Yeah, but I never because I didn't-- 

Q. But you've never called them? 
A. No. 

Q. Is it your evidence that as you're sitting here today, two years after that conversation, that you've got a clear memory of that conversation? 
A. I've got sort of a memory of it, yes. 

Q. Sort of a memory? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. And even though it was two years ago? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Your memory of that conversation is not entirely clear and complete though is it? 
A. Partly. 

Q. And you've got some problems with your memory because of the strokes and the time that's gone by? 
A. (No verbal reply). 

Q. [MH] didn't tell you that she had made up her evidence, did she? 
A. Yes, she did for sure. 

Q. In fact what [MH] told you is that other people around town were saying that, isn't that correct? 
A. I don't know about that. 

Q. Well, what do you say to that proposition? [MH] in the phone call with you told you that the word around town was that the case had been made up? 
A. Yes."" 

The parties ' submissions 

43The appellant submitted that the evidence in question was fresh evidence arising from a conversation which had taken place after conviction. Counsel for the appellant submitted it was credible, that is, capable of belief, relying on the fact that parts were consistent with the evidence of MH, that there was no issue that two phone calls took place on the day in question from a phone booth, and that there was a discussion about FW being on drugs. She also relied on the letter and submitted that JM was unshaken in cross-examination. She submitted that if the jury was to accept the evidence there was a significant possibility it would raise a doubt in their minds. 

44The Crown submitted that JM's evidence should be rejected along with what she wrote in her letter, pointing to her lack of memory and saying that the reason she may have been confused was because of the rumours that the case had been fabricated, something she had been told by MH. 

Consideration 

45The principles on which a verdict of acquittal or a new trial will be ordered on the grounds of fresh evidence are relatively well settled. In Ratten v R [1974] HCA 35; (1974) 131 CLR 510, Barwick CJ said (at [518]): 

""In every situation the court must decide on the relevance of the new evidence, even in the case of a reference by the Attorney-General such as the present. It must decide its credibility, that is to say whether or not it is capable of belief, both as to veracity and competence in the case of oral evidence, and as to authenticity in the case of documentary evidence. But in some situations, as I shall point out, the court will decide whether it believes the evidence. In other situations it will be enough that, whatever its own view, the evidence is capable of belief, and likely to be believed, by reasonable men. 

Having considered relevance and credibility, the court will weigh the cogency of the evidence, having in mind always the evidence produced at the trial. That evidence will be taken in that sense in which, having regard to its verdict, the jury must have accepted it. 

For all these purposes the court may see and hear the witnesses of the new evidence, both Crown and appellant being entitled to examine and cross-examine as the case may be. Further, the court will be entitled to receive evidence which tends to support, contradict or weaken the new evidence or the inferences which might be drawn therefrom."" 

46In circumstances where what is sought is that the conviction be quashed and a new trial ordered, there are three questions that need to be considered. First, is the evidence fresh evidence in the sense that it was not available to the appellant at the time of trial: see Ratten v R supra, at 512; second, was it credible or capable of belief and third, was there a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the appellant. These principles were summarised by Kirby J in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356 at [63], Mason P and Levine J agreeing. 

47In the present case there is no issue as to the freshness of the evidence. It arose out of a conversation which took place after conviction. 

48What is required in respect of the second question was considered by the High Court in Gallagher v R [1986] HCA 26; (1986) 160 CLR 392 and Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; (1989) 167 CLR 259. 

49In Gallagher v R supra, Gibbs CJ stated the evidence had to be credible or at least capable of belief. He went on to say as follows (at 397, citations omitted): 

""There can be no doubt that the Court of Criminal Appeal is required to form some view as to the credibility of the fresh evidence. In some cases the Court of Criminal Appeal will be able to reach a firm conclusion as to whether the evidence is trustworthy or unreliable, but in many cases it will be able to do no more than decide whether or not the evidence is apparently credible, or capable of being believed. Where the fresh evidence conflicts with the evidence given at the trial, and the Court of Criminal Appeal has not heard the witnesses with whose evidence it is in conflict, it will often not be possible to decide whether a reasonable jury would (or might) believe the fresh evidence: cf per Stephen J in Lawless v The Queen . Further, as Mason J pointed out in the same case, the question will not necessarily be whether the evidence is likely to be believed by a jury, because evidence may be sufficiently cogent and plausible to lead a jury to have a reasonable doubt, although the jury might not necessarily prefer it to other evidence with which it is inconsistent."" 

50His Honour in considering the third question then made the following comments (at 399): 

""It seems to me, with all respect, that where the trial was by jury, the accused was entitled to have the question of his guilt determined by the verdict of the jury, and that the Court of Criminal Appeal, in considering the effect of the fresh evidence, should consider what effect it might have had upon a reasonable jury. It is not enough that there is a bare possibility that a jury might have been influenced by the evidence to return a verdict of not guilty. On the other hand, it is too severe, and indeed speculative, a test, to require that the Court should grant a new trial only if it concludes that the fresh evidence was likely to have produced a different result, in the sense that it would probably have done so. I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by Mason and Deane JJ who suggest that the Court of Criminal Appeal will conclude that the unavailability of the fresh evidence at the time of the trial will have involved a miscarriage of justice if the Court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant if the new evidence had been before it at the trial. I am in substantial agreement with this statement. However, I would emphasize that no form of words should be regarded as an incantation that will resolve the difficulties of every case. No test can detract from the force of the fundamental principle that the appeal must be allowed if a miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred. It is only a practical guide to the application of that principle to say that the court will grant a new trial if, having approached the matter with the caution that is always demanded when fresh evidence is produced in a criminal case, and having weighed the credibility of the fresh evidence and considered its cogency in the light of the evidence given at the trial, it considers that a jury might reasonably have reached a different verdict if the evidence had been available at the trial."" 

51Whilst Mason and Deane JJ suggested the correct approach in the following terms (at 402): 

""Regardless of the precise words in which one describes requirements such as 'cogency', 'plausibility' or 'credibility', the ultimate question for decision by an appellate court when considering an application for a new trial on the ground of fresh evidence in the relevant sense, is, as the remarks of Rich and Dixon JJ in Craig indicate, whether there has been a miscarriage of justice at the trial. The appellate court will conclude that the unavailability of the new evidence at the time of the trial involved such a miscarriage if, and only if, it considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the applicant of the charge if the new evidence had been before it in the trial. Obviously, that question can only be answered in the context of, and by reference to, 'the probative force and the nature of the evidence already adduced at the trial'."" 

52In Mickelberg v The Queen supra, Mason CJ stated the position as follows (at 273, citations omitted): 

""The final matter concerns the appropriate test to be applied by an appellate court in deciding whether to set aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence. It is established that the proper question is whether the court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial. This test was endorsed by four of the five Justices in Gallagher v The Queen . Deane J and I considered that the test was best expressed in those terms. Gibbs CJ expressed his substantial agreement with the statement, although his Honour emphasized that 'no form of words should be regarded as an incantation that will resolve the difficulties of every case'. Dawson J said that the court would need to conclude that 'a jury might entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant'. His Honour went on to say that in his view the use of the expression 'significant possibility' did not involve a different standard. I am in agreement with those statements."" 

Whilst Toohey and Gaudron JJ expressed the following views (at 301) (emphasis added): 

""In essence, the fresh evidence must be such that, when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused if all the evidence had been before it ( Gallagher , per Brennan J) or, if there be a practical difference, that there is 'a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the [accused]' ( Gallagher , per Gibbs CJ and per Mason and Deane JJ). If there is a difference it is not material to the outcome of the present applications. For ease of expression we proceed by reference to the formulation that the jury is likely to have entertained reasonable doubt had all the evidence been before it, noting, in that context, that it is necessary that the fresh evidence be credible in the sense that a reasonable jury could accept it as true, but it is not necessary that the court should think it likely that a reasonable jury would believe it: see Lawless , per Mason J, and Gallagher , per Brennan J, but cf Barwick CJ in Ratten.

53It should be noted that the formulation by Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Mickelberg was different to that of Dawson J in Gallagher , namely that the jury might entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. Notwithstanding this, this Court has adopted the approach of Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Mickelberg and stated that there is no practical difference between the formulation that a jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt and the formulation that there was a significant possibility that a jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the appellant: See R v Abou-Chabake supra at [63]. 

54Uninstructed by authority, I would have considered that the test of significant possibility imposed a somewhat lower threshold than the test of whether the evidence was such that a jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. However, in the present case the application of either test, in my view, will lead to the same result. 

55The evidence is fresh evidence in the sense that it was not available at the trial. The parties accepted it first arose in the conversation to which JM deposed. 

56In my opinion, the evidence of JM is credible in the sense that it is capable of belief. Although the Court had an opportunity of observing JM and MH in the witness box, it was not possible in my opinion, to decide more than that the evidence was capable of being believed: See Gallagher v R supra at 397. Having said that, there were a number of difficulties with the evidence of JM which are relevant to the consideration of the question of whether, if the evidence was before the jury, there was a significant possibility that the appellant would be acquitted. 

57Turning to the third question I am, however, of the view that if the evidence was before the jury there would not have been a significant possibility of the appellant being acquitted. This is for a number of reasons. 

58First, it is by no means clear precisely what MH was referring to in the alleged conversations. She is alleged to have said that both her statements before the Court were made up. She is not alleged to have directly said that she gave false evidence in the Court, although it may perhaps be inferred that was what she was allegedly intending to convey. 

59Second and aligned to this point, assuming the jury accepted the evidence of JM as a true recollection, it is not clear what part of MH's statement or her evidence MH was stating to be false. It must be remembered that MH gave evidence at the trial on two issues of importance, namely, that the complainant had complained to her about the first incident and, secondly, that the complainant had complained to her about the second incident. It is not clear whether she was saying she lied about each of these complaints. 

60Third, it is not entirely clear from the evidence that MH was saying that she simply went along with what FW and the complainant told her or that she actively participated with them in falsifying the evidence before the Court. JM's evidence was that MH said: ""Both of my statements for courts were made up between [FW], [the complainant] and me. I just went along with what [FW] and [the complainant] told me"". Although the previous sentence attributed to her would suggest that she was complicit in providing false evidence, there is ambiguity in the last sentence. 

61Fourth, it must be remembered that MH denied the terms of the conversation. Once again, although it was not possible to form a view as to her reliability, nothing was put to her which would suggest that her denials were false. 

62Fifth, aligned to the fourth matter there are a number of difficulties with the evidence of JM. She admitted her memory was unreliable and that sometimes she could not remember or might not understand what was going on. More importantly, she initially said her grandchildren were not mentioned at all, although later in her evidence she said MH told her she had custody of the children. She admitted MH gave her her mobile phone number and said she could ring the children but said she did not think there was any further conversation about them, something which might seem surprising. Ultimately she said that MH told her that the word around town was that the case had been made up. That, of course, was something different to a statement that MH had been complicit in making up the case. 

63Sixth, the inconsistency in the evidence of the complainant and that of MH to which I have referred above (see at [21], [23]-[27]) if anything tends against the suggestion that the story was concocted between MH, the complainant and FW. 

64Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the jury had the opportunity of observing the complainant, MH and FW in the witness box and of making an assessment of their credibility. Taking all of the factors referred to above into account, it does not seem to me that the assertions of JM, coupled with the denial of those assertions by MH, would influence the jury such that there would be a significant possibility of an acquittal. 

65In those circumstances, leave to appeal against conviction should be granted, but the appeal dismissed. 

The appeal against sentence 

66Her Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a term of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 4 month and 15 days from 26 February 2009 to expire on 11 July 2012. The appellant has appealed on the following two grounds: 

(1) Her Honour erred in determining that there was an additional aggravating feature of breach of trust, separate from the circumstances of ""authority"" set out in the indictment. 

(2) The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 

Her Honour ' s remarks on sentence 

67In her remarks on sentence her Honour set out the facts surrounding the count on which the appellant was found guilty broadly in accordance with the account of the complainant to which I have referred above. She accepted that she had to consider so far as possible in sentencing the appellant, sentencing practice as at the date of the offence. 

68In relation to the question of breach of trust her Honour made the following comments (at 4-5): 

""In relation to the consideration of breach of trust, this is a separate circumstance from part of the indictment that [the complainant] was under the offender's authority. The breach of trust which I take into account here, which is an obvious and aggravating feature, is in relation to [MRW] being [the complainant's] father on the one hand, and at the time she was also under his authority. The abuse of trust involved between a father and a child is an obvious aggravating feature."" 

69In dealing with mitigating factors her Honour found no evidence of remorse, nor any evidence upon which a court could make a finding that his prospects of rehabilitation were good. She found, however, that from the early 1990's he was a contributing member of the community, who took his family responsibilities and financial responsibilities seriously. 

70Her Honour found the offence to be a spontaneous single act of criminality committed for a relatively short period of time, but not of a momentary nature, and the actions ceased upon complaint. She assessed the offence as below mid-range seriousness, although when she came to pronounce sentence she described it as close to the mid-range. 

71Her Honour took certain subjective factors relating to the appellant into account. She found he was 46 years of age and had a small but supportive family which would be important to him upon his release. 

The parties ' submissions on ground 1 

72The appellant pointed to s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Act"") which provided that the court in sentencing is not to have regard to any aggravating factor if it is an element of the offence. This, of course, is to avoid double counting on sentencing: See, for example, R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186. 

73The appellant submitted that taking into account as an aggravating feature abuse of position of trust in circumstances where one of the elements of the offence was that it occurred whilst the complainant was under the appellant's authority, was an error. It was submitted, in effect, that the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(k) of the Act was a single aggravating factor and as one of the elements of the offence was that it was committed ""under authority"" there was no room for its operation. 

74It was submitted that the error was compounded by the sentencing judge's remarks that MRW was a feared authority figure. It was submitted there was no evidence on which to base this finding. 

75The Crown by contrast submitted that s 21A(2)(k) referred to two distinct categories expressed in the alternative. The Crown also submitted that there was evidence justifying her Honour's description of the appellant as a feared authority figure. 

76Neither party was able to point to any authority which directly supported their respective positions. The Crown, however, referred to R v Slater [2003] NSWCCA 178 where Shaw J, with whom Grove J agreed, stated the notion of breach of trust was qualitatively different to the notion of under authority. The Crown also referred to FV v R [2006] NSWCCA 237 at [57] and R v LTP [2004] NSWCCA 109 at [109] as supporting its position. However, as the appellant correctly pointed out, the issue the subject of this ground of appeal did not fall for consideration in any of those cases. 

Decision 

77There can be little doubt, in my opinion, that the matters referred to in s 21A(2)(k), namely abuse of trust and abuse of authority, are distinct concepts although commonly arising out of the same facts. As only the latter of the two concepts formed an element of the offence, in my opinion, it was open to the trial judge to take the former factor into account as an aggravating feature on sentencing. 

78However, when the circumstances giving rise to abuse of trust or abuse of authority arise from the same facts it would seem to me that a sentencing judge should be cautious in giving undue weight to an abuse of a position of trust where abuse of authority is an aggravating factor. In circumstances where a sentencing judge does so, error may result with the prospect of intervention by this Court. However, the judge committed no error in taking abuse of a position of trust into account in sentencing the appellant. 

79Further, it does not seem to me that the judge erred in concluding that the appellant was ""a feared authority figure"". Having regard to the jury's verdict, she was entitled to accept the complainant's evidence that she would get into a heap of trouble and get flogged if she complained, and the complainant's evidence of the conduct of MRW when confronted with the complaint (T 5/8/09 p 12). This evidence, in my opinion, provided justification for her conclusion. 

80It follows that the first ground of appeal has not been made out. 

The parties ' submissions on ground 2 

81The appellant submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. He relied in particular on her Honour's finding as to the nature of the offence to which I have referred above. He pointed out that the maximum penalty was 10 years and submitted that in such a case a head sentence of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months and 15 days was manifestly excessive. 

82The appellant relied on some statistical evidence. He acknowledged there were limited statistics available for the previous offence under s 66C(2) as there were only five cases available involving a single act of criminality. However, he submitted that in four of those cases a non-parole period of 3 years or less was imposed, whilst only one case involved a head sentence of greater than 4 years. He also pointed out that 51 percent of all offenders being sentenced for multiple offences under s 66C(2) received a head sentence of 4 years or less and only two received a non-parole period of 3 years or less. 

83The Crown in its submissions pointed to a number of problems with the statistics. It pointed out that it included sentences containing discounts for pleas of guilty and offences where the offender was of prior good character. The Crown submitted that the appellant was not of good character, having been convicted in 1987 for maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. The Crown submitted these factors would tend to suggest that a sentence for an offence against a ten year old after a trial and where the offender was not of prior good character could well be found at the top of the range. 

84The Crown also submitted that generally speaking the top of the statistical range is generally not the maximum sentence. Reference is made in that regard to what was said by this Court in Williams v R [2010] NSWCCA 15 at [23] and Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22 at [43]-[44]. 

85The Crown also referred to the fact that in R v LTP supra a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years imposed in respect of a single offence under s 66C(2), with a maximum penalty of 10 years, was quashed by this Court and a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years imposed. The victim was the 12 year old daughter of the offender. The offender had no prior criminal convictions. Although the case was one of penile penetration the Crown submitted that it demonstrated that the sentence was within an acceptable range. 

Consideration 

86The offence in question at the time carried a maximum penalty of 10 years. There was at the time no standard non-parole period. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was a little less than half the maximum penalty. The question is whether that sentence was so long as to lead to the conclusion that the sentencing discretion miscarried and the sentence was unjust and unreasonable: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58]; Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 85 ALJR 195 at [59]. 

87In the present case I do not find the statistics particularly helpful. They were simply too limited and covered too wide a variety of potential offences to be of any assistance: See Hili v R supra at [54]. Further, contrary to the submissions of the Crown, I do not find the sentence imposed by this Court in R v LTP supra conclusive in the present case. 

88Although minds may well differ as to the appropriateness of the sentence, it seems to me that having regard to the nature of the offence, the maximum penalty, the age of the child, the prior criminal history of the appellant, the absence of any identifiable error in the reasoning of the trial judge on sentencing and the fact that the appellant was sentenced after a trial in which he pleaded not guilty, her Honour's sentence was not unreasonable or unjust such as to demonstrate error in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. In the circumstances, this ground of appeal has not been made out. 

89It follows that leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and the appeal dismissed. 

90The orders I would therefore make are: 

1 Leave to appeal against conviction granted, appeal dismissed. 

2 Leave to appeal against sentence granted, appeal dismissed. 

91JAMES J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 

92JOHNSON J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

2708817,"R v Amatto, Martin [2011] NSWDC 194","Judgment 
Application to reject expert fingerprint identification 
1. Martin James Amatto is on trial in relation to an alleged robbery of a person at the Flying Horse Truck Stop on 10 October 2009. The crown case is the robber is Mr Amatto. My understanding is the Flying Horse Truck Stop is a service station and the alleged victim was an employee or otherwise associated with the owners of the service station. The money taken the crown alleges belonged to the owners of the service station. 
2. In the course of investigation fingerprints were lifted from the crime scene. The lifted fingerprints were passed onto a Sergeant Brian Worboys, who is presented by the prosecution as an expert witness, his field of expertise being, so far as this trial is concerned, the science of fingerprints. The effect of his statement is, to identify a lifted fingerprint as being the fingerprint of the right middle finger of the accused. 
3. Mr Corr, acting Public Defender, on behalf of the accused, argues what I might call the rule in Mundarra Smith (see Mundarra Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650) applies, namely that the Crown can tender the accused fingerprints and the image of the lifted fingerprint for the jury to make its own mind up on the question of fact whether the lifted fingerprint matches any of the accused fingerprints. 
4. Put another way, he argues the opinion of Sergeant Worboys is not relevant on this occasion because the jury can make its own comparison of the lifted fingerprint with those of the accused. 
5. With respect the argument does not appear to be well thought through. If prosecutors were not required to rely upon expert opinion evidence in respect of fingerprints, they could tender crime scene fingerprints and an accused person's fingerprints and invite a jury to come to its own view about the fingerprints even where the requisite number of identification points had not been reached. Indeed, the notion of a requisite number of identification points could now be abandoned. 
6. Sergeant Worboys makes clear his comparison involved comparisons of pattern type, ridge flow, friction ridge characteristics, and their relative position to each other, and the number of intervening ridges between these characteristics. No doubt that is part of the science of fingerprints in operation in the course of his identification. 
7. The identification of fingerprints also involves an understanding of the qualities of the compound initially dusted or sprayed, as the case may be onto the surface where the lifted fingerprint was obtained. In other words, in order to make the comparison he makes he has relied upon specialised knowledge to reach an opinion. 
8. I am satisfied in the absence of such specialised knowledge any opinion formed about matching fingerprints would be dangerous to rely upon. For example, I would regard it as dangerous to allow any arresting or investigating police officer to be allowed to say ""I saw the fingerprint on the counter and I later saw the accused fingerprints taken at an earlier point in time by police and I can safely say they are one and the same"". Or alternatively, it would be dangerous to allow a police officer to say, ""I recognised the accused fingerprint on the knife used in the robbery and I was able to recognise the similarity of them with the accused fingerprints we had at the station and I can safely say they are the one and the same."" 
9. Clearly, that is the equivalent of what is being proposed by the defence- that fingerprints are capable of lay comparison and lay recognition by an untrained eye. That cannot possibly be the case. The objection [by the defence] is rejected.

2708821,"MONIS, Man Haron v R; DROUDIS, Amirah v R [2011] NSWCCA 231","Judgment 

BATHURST CJ: 

Introduction and background 

1By an indictment presented on 12 April 2011, the appellant Man Haron Monis was charged with 12 counts of using a postal service, namely Australia Post, in a way that a reasonable person would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive contrary to s 471.12 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). Mr Monis was also charged with one count of using a postal service, Australia Post, in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, harassing contrary to s 471.12 of the Criminal Code . 

2The appellant Amirah Droudis was indicted on eight counts of aiding and abetting the commission of offences by Mr Monis in using Australia Post in a way that a reasonable person in all the circumstances would regard as offensive contrary to s 471.12 of the Criminal Code. 

3Section 471.12 of the Criminal Code provides as follows: 

""A person is guilty of an offence if: 

(a) the person uses a postal or similar service; and 

(b) the person does so in a way (whether by the method of use or the content of a communication, or both) that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, menacing, harassing or offensive. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years."" 

4The charges relate to letters allegedly sent by Mr Monis to the wives and relatives of Australian military personnel killed while serving in Afghanistan. Copies of the letters were sent on occasions to various politicians including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Defence. It is not necessary to go into the terms of the letters in any detail. However, whilst at one level the letters are critical of the involvement of the Australian Military in Afghanistan, they also refer to the deceased soldiers in a denigrating and derogatory fashion. 

5Each of the appellants moved the District Court to quash the indictments; Mr Monis on the ground that s 471.12 is invalid (wholly or in part) as it infringes the implied constitutional freedom of political communication and Mr Droudis on the ground that s 471.12 is contrary to the implied freedom of political communication. 

6In a judgment delivered on 18 April 2011, Tupman DCJ dismissed each motion. On 21 April 2011, Tupman DCJ granted the appellants certificates pursuant to s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 certifying that her Honour's judgment on the motions was a proper one for determination on appeal. 

7During the course of the hearing of the appeal senior counsel for Mr Monis informed the Court that the challenge to the harassment charge was abandoned. 

Primary judge ' s reasons 

8Her Honour took the view that it was not necessary to analyse each of the letters in question in detail. However, she stated that she was required to determine whether the correspondence assessed broadly was capable of constituting political or governmental communication. She accepted that it was so capable (at [14]). 

9Her Honour then correctly recognised that the first step she was required to take in dealing with the notice of motion was to construe the legislation, in particular the word ""offensive"". Her Honour's conclusion was as follows: 

""[24] ... In context it means something that would be likely to wound (as opposed to merely hurt) the feelings, arouse anger or resentment or disgust or outrage in the mind of a reasonable person in all of the circumstances. On this construction, it would not be sufficient for an offence to be committed under this section if all the postal article did was to vex, annoy or displease the recipient or to lead only to hurt feelings on the part of the recipient. It must be more than that. To the extent that the accused argue that a proper construction of the term ' offensive ' in S471.12 could mean merely creating hurt feelings on the part of the recipient of the postal article, I reject those submissions. I accept CDPP's submission that the term ' offensive ' in this section must be construed as meaning 'seriously or grossly offensive' but I reject the CDPP's submission that it could be construed to include a meaning, 'repugnant in a moral sense'. It seems to be that there is nothing in the authorities to support this construction, nor does such a construction arise otherwise."" 

10Her Honour then considered whether, by reference to the two questions stated by the High Court in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; (1997) 189 CLR 520 ("" Lange "") and as modified in Coleman v Power [2004] HCA 39; (2004) 220 CLR 1 ("" Coleman v Power ""), s 471.12 so construed was contrary to the implied freedom of political communication. In answer to the first question her Honour concluded that the law effectively burdened freedom of communication about governmental or political matters. However, she answered the second question posed in Lange in the affirmative, finding that the law was reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legislative end and in a manner which is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government. 

11In reaching this conclusion, her Honour held that the section had two purposes. First, ""to protect the integrity of the post both physically and as a means of communication in which the public can have confidence"" (at [45]). Second, to prevent breaches of the peace and protect the recipient from harm. Her Honour's conclusion was to the following effect: 

""[46] I also accept that the provision has a further legitimate end, consistent with the Commonwealth's powers to legislate for peace, order and good government in relation to postal services which concentrates on the impact a postal article may have on its recipient. I accept that this further legitimate end is twofold, namely to prevent breaches of the peace which might flow from receipt of an offensive postal article and also to protect the recipient of such an article from harm. I accept the argument on behalf of the accused, that the risk of breaches of the peace is less immediate when dealing with the receipt of a letter as opposed to being present and hearing insulting words, as was the factual position under consideration in Coleman -v- Power, but it is not remote on my finding. Further, seriously offensive letters can cause anger and resentment and harm in the recipient and an attempt to prevent the postal services from being used in that way I accept is part of the purpose of the section and a legitimate purpose."" 

12After taking into account a number of matters raised by the parties, her Honour concluded that the section was reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate legislative end and in a manner which was compatible with the maintenance of the system of government prescribed by the Constitution. She summarised the matters she took into account in reaching her conclusion at [51] of her judgment: 

""[51] The matters I take into account, raised by both accused and also the CDPP, in determining whether this law is appropriate and adapted to achieve its legitimate end include: 

That the impact on political and governmental communications of S471.12 is only indirect and incidental. The intention of the provision, particularly viewed in the light of its legislative history, is broadly to prevent public postal services being used to disseminate more generally offensive material, not to regulate or limit dissemination of political and governmental communication through the post. 

That it is a provision giving rise to a criminal sanction. 

That this provision may have a chilling effect on political communication because its limits are uncertain and might amount to massive overreach to achieve its legitimate ends, leading to the risk of selective prosecution. 

That in terms there are no defences for an offence committed under the section, but this I accept is subject to the important qualifying words in the section ' ..that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances..' . 

That this is a provision enacted post Lange so that it can be inferred that the legislature did not intend the section to catch postal communications which are genuinely political or governmental communications in their true context, but rather that it apply to communication that is offensive in a way that goes beyond its relevance to political debate or beyond its political purpose. 

That any impact on the implied freedom is limited by the fact that, if at all, it applies only to postal services, and that representative government and political discourse which underpins democratic and representative government is not broadly affected by the provision. 

Significantly in my view are the words appearing in the Section, '..that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances..' as a qualifier of the term 'offensive' . This is not just relevant to a construction of the term 'offensive' but is important because it means that the law is not unqualified or unlimited in its operation, which was a matter Justice McHugh considered important in determining the validity of the disputed provision in Coleman -v- Power. These qualifying words would in my view allow the tribunal of fact to determine the context in which the postal service was used by an accused person, including the intended identity of the recipient of a postal communication, any circumstances surrounding that person and his or her receipt of such an article, the circumstances of the accused including it seems to me his state of mind and the extent to which that might be genuinely reflected in the content of the communication, contemporary debate about current political issues, contemporary values about political debate in a robust democracy and similar maters concerning the circumstances in which such a communication is made."" 

Appellants ' submissions 

13The appellants contended that the meaning of ""offensive"" in the legislation was that suggested by Pape J in Inglis v Fish [1961] VR 607. The alleged offence in that case was offensive behaviour in a public place. Pape J stated that in the context of that offence the expression ""offensive"" meant ""calculated to wound the feelings, arouse anger or resentment, or disgust, or outrage in the mind of a reasonable person"". The appellants, Mr Monis in particular, submitted that her Honour erred in excluding from the ambit of the expression conduct which is merely hurtful, annoying or displeasing. They submitted this was inconsistent with what was said by this Court in R v Smith (1974) 2 NSWLR 586 at 587 and that the distinction drawn by her Honour between conduct hurtful to feelings and conduct likely to wound feelings was meaningless. They further submitted that there was no justification for limiting the expression ""offensive"" to ""grossly offensive"" conduct, pointing out that the expression ""grossly offensive"" appeared in the equivalent legislation in existence from 1901 to 30 June 1975, but the word ""grossly"" was removed from subsequent emanations of the legislation. 

14Each of the appellants supported her Honour's conclusion that the law effectively burdened communications about governmental or political matters. However, they contended that her Honour erred in holding that the law was reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end in a manner compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government. They submitted that the law is not necessary to protect the integrity of the post as most postal articles would not affect its physical integrity and a conveyance of offensive material would not affect public confidence in the post. The appellants further submitted that the legislation was ill adapted to preventing breaches of the peace having regard to the enormous number of circumstances it could cover which would often not incite such breaches. They pointed to the uncertainty of its operation, submitting that given its width and vagueness it would have a chilling effect on freedom of speech generally and in particular on political and governmental communications. 

Respondent ' s submissions 

15The respondent contended that the use of the word ""offensive"" in association with ""menacing"" and ""harassing"" demonstrated that the word in context meant something more than merely hurtful or annoying and that in the particular context in which it was used it meant seriously offensive or grossly offensive. 

16So far as the first of the questions raised in Lange was concerned, it contended that the law did not burden communications on governmental or political matters. It submitted that there were two issues to be considered in answering that question. The first involved an analysis of the communication in question. The respondents submitted that the letters were not communications about governmental or political matters at all but rather represented personal attacks on the deceased soldiers and that the fact that the letters may in part refer to a political matter does not mean those parts which are not directed to governmental and political issues do not fall within the section. The respondents submitted that this approach was consistent with the approach taken by the Western Australia Court of Appeal in Holland v The Queen [2005] WASCA 140 and by the High Court in APLA Ltd v Legal Services Commissioner (NSW) [2005] HCA 44; (2005) 224 CLR 322. 

17The respondent also submitted that to the extent there was any burden it was only incidental and light, so as not to effectively burden the implied freedom. In that regard, reliance was placed on the decision of Kerr J in Ball v McIntyre (1966) 9 FLR 237 that the offence of offensive behaviour in a public place was not directed at controlling actions which were no more than statements of political opinion, albeit which may have been expressed in a distasteful manner or with which the majority of the community would not agree. 

18The respondent also submitted that the second question posed by Lange should be answered in the affirmative. It said that s 471.12 had two legitimate purposes; first, protecting the integrity of the post as a means of communication in which the public could have confidence and second, avoiding breaches of the peace. It contended that words can be inflammatory, provoke violence or self-harm, and can inflict pain and adversely effect the health of the recipient. 

19The respondent further pointed out that the qualification in the section that the use of the postal service had to be regarded by reasonable persons in all the circumstances as offensive was of importance in considering this issue. It submitted that that determination would be made in the context that in this country, political debate is of a robust nature. It pointed out that this qualification was not contained in the legislation considered in Coleman v Power . It submitted that the legislation enhanced the system of representative and responsible government and it protected those who participated from uses of the post that are menacing, harassing or offensive. 

Attorney General ' s submissions 

20The Attorney General intervened in support of the respondent. He supported the construction of the word ""offensive"" found by the primary judge, pointing out that it would not be expected that a section creating a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of two years would be created for behaviour that was trivial or minor such as merely hurting or wounding feelings. He submitted that because the word was associated with menacing and harassing, it connoted behaviour likely to arouse significant emotional reactions of a similar nature. 

21The Attorney General also pointed to the fact that the use of the postal service related to the method of use as well as the content of the communication. He submitted that this demonstrated that one of the purposes of the legislation was to protect the integrity of the post. 

22The Solicitor General who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General did not seek to support the submission made by the respondent that the first of the two questions posed by Lange should be answered in the negative, but submitted that the legislation was reasonably appropriate and adapted to secure a legitimate end compatible with the maintenance of a system of representative and responsible government. He pointed to the fact that the question was not whether the choice made by parliament in enacting the legislation was preferable or desirable but rather whether it was reasonable. He also drew the distinction between laws that have as their purpose the restriction of communication on governmental or political matters and those that merely affect such communications incidentally. He submitted that the law in question in the present case fell into the latter category and, as the limiting effect was incidental and unrelated to the political nature of the communication, an affirmative answer to the second question posed by Lange was unlikely. 

23The Solicitor General submitted that in those circumstances the primary judge was correct in her conclusion, particularly having regard to the fact that for there to be a contravention, the communication must be offensive to a reasonable person in all the circumstances. 

Analysis 

24The parties agreed that the question of whether the legislation infringed the implied constitutional freedom of communication about governmental or political matters was to be determined by reference to the questions posed by the High Court in Lange (at 567-568) as modified in Coleman v Power (at [93]-[96], citations omitted): 

""[93] No doubt the Court would have made the meaning of the second limb in Lange clearer if it had used the phrase 'in a manner' instead of the phrase 'the fulfilment of' in that limb. The second limb would then have read 'is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end [in a manner] which is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government?'. However, it is clear that the Court did intend the second limb to be read in a way that requires that both the end and the manner of its achievement be compatible with the system of representative and responsible government. This is clear from the example that the Court gave immediately after formulating the two-limb test. The Court said: 

'In ACTV , for example, a majority of this Court held that a law seriously impeding discussion during the course of a federal election was invalid because there were other less drastic means by which the objectives of the law could be achieved . And the common law rules, as they have traditionally been understood, must be examined by reference to the same considerations. If it is necessary, they must be developed to ensure that the protection given to personal reputation does not unnecessarily or unreasonably impair the freedom of communication about government and political matters which the Constitution requires.' (emphasis added) 

[94] The example of ACTV shows that in Lange the Court intended the adjectival phrase 'compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system' to govern the means by which the impugned law achieved its end. The Parliament had enacted the relevant legislation in ACTV 'to safeguard the integrity of the political system by reducing, if not eliminating, pressure on political parties and candidates to raise substantial sums of money in order to engage in political campaigning on television and radio, a pressure which renders them vulnerable to corruption and to undue influence by those who donate to political campaign funds'. Despite the object of the legislation - an object that enhanced representative government - Parliament adopted means that were not compatible with the implied freedom. The ACTV example demonstrates the point that it is the content of the law - the manner in which it seeks to achieve the end - as well as the end which must be compatible with the prescribed system. 

[95] The true test was clearly expressed by Kirby J in his judgment in Levy v Victoria . After discussing a number of tests that have been used to determine whether a law is consistent with the freedom, his Honour said: 

'A universally accepted criterion is elusive. In Australia, without the express conferral of rights which individuals may enforce, it is necessary to come back to the rather more restricted question. This is: does the law which is impugned have the effect of preventing or controlling communication upon political and governmental matters in a manner which is inconsistent with the system of representative government for which the Constitution provides?' (emphasis added) 

[96] In my view, this formulation accurately states the second limb of the Lange test. It emphasises that a law that burdens communications on political or governmental matters in the sense I have explained will be invalid unless it seeks to achieve an end in a manner that is consistent with the system of representative government enshrined in the Constitution.""

Construction of s 471.12 

25The first step in assessing the validity of any given law is one of statutory construction. Further, so far as different constructions appear to be available, a construction is to be selected which would avoid, rather than lead to, a conclusion of constitutional invalidity: Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club Inc v Commissioner of Police [2008] HCA 4; (2008) 234 CLR 532 at [11]. 

26Although the section in the present case has not been the subject of judicial consideration, the meaning and extent of offensive behaviour has been considered in the context of a number of other statutes in circumstances involving political activity. 

27In Worcester v Smith [1951] VLR 316 O'Bryan J considered the meaning of ""offensive behaviour"" in s 25 of the Police Offences Act 1928 (Vic) which prohibited behaving in an offensive manner in a public place. The defendant in that case was one of a group of demonstrators demonstrating against the Korean War outside the United States Consulate in Melbourne. He was carrying a banner ""Stop Yank Intervention in Korea"" and in a discussion with a bystander, in response to a comment ""You Communists are only looking for trouble"", he replied, ""The bloody Yanks are causing the trouble"". The Court held there was no evidence to support a charge of offensive behaviour. In the course of his judgment O'Bryan J made the following comments (at 317): 

""In my opinion, the whole of this evidence did not support the charge of offensive behaviour. This section is not directed to the peaceful and inoffensive statement either verbally or in writing of political views. There is nothing, in my opinion, in the wording of any of the banners which could reasonably be taken to be offensive. They are strong expressions of opposition to a political policy with which the great majority in this community would probably agree. The mere disagreement with that policy, whilst it may be in one sense offensive to some people, is not, in my opinion, offensive in the sense in which this word is used in sec. 25."" 

and (at 318): 

""The behaviour of the defendant in this case, in my opinion, fell far short of being offensive as that word is used in sec. 25. Behaviour, to be 'offensive' within the meaning of that section, must, in my opinion, be such as is calculated to wound the feelings, arouse anger or resentment or disgust or outrage in the mind of a reasonable person. The mere expression of political views, even when made in the proximity of the offices of those whose opinions or views are being attacked, does not, in my opinion, amount to offensive behaviour within the meaning of this police offence."" 

28In Ball v McIntyre supra, a student was charged with behaving in an offensive manner in a public place contrary to s 17(d) of the Police Offences Ordinance 1930-1961 (ACT). The act complained of was that on the occasion of a political demonstration against the Vietnam War, the student hung a placard upon and squatted on the pedestal of a statue erected as a public memorial to King George V outside Parliament House, Canberra. In allowing an appeal from a conviction by a magistrate, Kerr J made the following remarks: 

""The question therefore is, was this political behaviour, because of its nature and circumstances, also offensive behaviour? It is clear that some kinds of political behaviour can be offensive behaviour in the eyes of the law, but one must be careful in the case of political behaviour not to condemn as offensive, conduct of which one disapproves on political grounds."" (at 240) 

and 

""People may be offended by such conduct, but it may well not be offensive conduct within the meaning of the section. Some types of political conduct may offend against accepted views or opinions and may be hurtful to those who hold those accepted views or opinions. But such political conduct, even though not thought to be proper conduct by accepted standards, may not be offensive conduct within the section. Conduct showing a refusal to accept commonly held attitudes of respect to institutions or objects held in high esteem by most may not product offensive behaviour, although in some cases, of course, it may."" (at 241) 

29Kerr J also pointed out (at 242) that the word ""offensive"" in s 17(d) is to be found with the words ""threatening, abusive and insulting"", all words which he said carried with them the idea of behaviour likely to arouse significant emotional reaction. 

30The matter was considered by this Court in R v Burgmann (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 May 1973, unreported). Ms Burgmann was convicted by a magistrate of behaving in an offensive manner in a public place during the course of an anti-apartheid demonstration at the Sydney Cricket Ground where a match between the South African Rugby Union team and a Sydney team was in progress. Ms Burgmann climbed the picket fence and sat down near the field of play. The game was stopped and Ms Burgmann and four others were arrested. 

31The Court of Criminal Appeal unanimously quashed the conviction. Jacobs P pointed out that it was notoriously difficult to define what behaviour is capable of being regarded as a criminal offence. He also stated that the section was not intended to make it a criminal offence to behave in a manner which might in particular circumstances offend another or others, and that if behaviour was innocent on one motivation and capable of offending some persons on another motivation it was not offensive behaviour. 

32Reynolds JA emphasised the need for some external standard. During the course of his judgment he made the following remarks: 

""It is upon this material that the question of law which I have previously mentioned is submitted to this Court. One difficulty is that the word 'offensive' is in the nature of a relative description of conduct. This aspect has been discussed in an article in 14 ALJ 384 by F C Hutley under the title 'Insulting Words'. It cannot be that it is enough if, in a subjective sense, some people or even many people would be offended by the conduct or behaviour complained of. There must surely be some external standard for otherwise strong political or religious opinions or criticisms would generally be regarded as offensive. That there must be an external standard has been recognised by the authorities in modern times."" 

33In the article referred to by Reynolds JA, Mr Hutley, as his Honour then was, dealt with the importance of offensive behaviour and similar forms of criminal conduct being evaluated by that which a reasonable person would regard as offensive. He pointed out (at 385) that the reasonable man provides a flexible measuring stick; one which can take account of social and technical progress and at the same time one which can be applied with due regard to human frailty. He described the reasonable person in the following terms: 

""It is submitted that the type whose reaction to words or conduct should give them their 'objectively' insulting or offensive character should be the 'sane' or 'balanced' citizen, one lacking the vanity of the Coroner in Ex parte Collier (Knox) (NSW) 513, or the touchiness in money matters of the prosecutor in Sellers v Bishop 11 ALR (Cn) 61, or the exaggerated sense of personal rectitude of the prosecutor in Windred v Manion 14 Tas LR 36."" 

34One might add to that characterisation of persons, a person not overly sensitive to robust political debate. In that context Mr Hutley (at 387) emphasised that the law had to consider political and religious freedoms. 

35I have been through these earlier cases in some detail because they demonstrate two things. First, the Courts have consistently emphasised the need to consider words such as offensive or insulting in conjunction with associated words. Second, although those cases all occurred before the High Court recognised the implied freedom of political communication, the courts were astute to interpret the sections so that they did not unduly fetter political debate. 

36I have set out the terms of s 471.12 above. It should be noted that it extends not only to the traditional postal service. Section 470.1 of the Criminal Code defines postal or similar service as follows: 

"" postal or similar service means: 

(a) a postal service (within the meaning of paragraph 51(v) of the Constitution); or 

(b) a courier service, to the extent to which the service is a postal or other like service (within the meaning of paragraph 51(v) of the Constitution); or 

(c) a packet or parcel carrying service, to the extent to which the service is a postal or other like service (within the meaning of paragraph 51(v) of the Constitution); or 

(d) any other service that is a postal or other like service (within the meaning of paragraph 51(v) of the Constitution); or 

(e) a courier service that is provided by a constitutional corporation; or 

(f) a packet or parcel carrying service that is provided by a constitutional corporation; or 

(g) a courier service that is provided in the course of, or in relation to, trade or commerce: 

(i) between Australia and a place outside Australia; or 

(ii) among the States; or 

(iii) between a State and a Territory or between 2 Territories; or 

(h) a packet or parcel carrying service that is provided in the course of, or in relation to, trade or commerce: 

(i) between Australia and a place outside Australia; or 

(ii) among the States; or 

(iii) between a State and a Territory or between 2 Territories."" 

37The section forms one of a number of provisions clearly directed to protecting people being harmed by misuse of the postal service. Thus s 471.10 prohibits postal or similar services being used to induce a false belief that an explosive or dangerous article has been left in any place, whilst s 471.13 prohibits a dangerous or explosive substance being carried by means of a postal service in a way which gives rise to the danger of death or serious harm to another person. The maximum penalty for each such offence is 10 years imprisonment. 

38Section 471.11(1) makes it an offence to use a postal service to threaten to kill another person whilst s 471.11(2) provides it is an offence to use a postal service to threaten to cause serious harm to a person. The maximum penalty for each of these offences is 10 years and 7 years imprisonment respectively. 

39Although the penalty for a contravention of s 471.12 is substantially less, it still creates a criminal offence with a significant penalty. 

40There are four significant differences between the legislation the subject of the cases to which I have referred, and the legislation in the present case. First, the penalty of two years is significantly greater. By contrast, the maximum penalty for offensive behaviour in a public place contrary to s 4 of the Summary Offences Act 1988 is three months imprisonment. This would tend to suggest that the conduct is directed to offences carrying a greater degree of criminality than those created by legislation such as s 4 of the Summary Offences Act. 

41Second, unlike offensive behaviour in a public place, the section extends to private communications. If the legislation extended to conduct which in the eyes of a reasonable person would tend to wound a recipient, a great deal of private correspondence would be caught by the section. At a prosaic level it would extend to all letters bitterly written in the aftermath of a relationship breakdown. It would be unlikely that the legislature intended this kind of conduct would be visited with a potential sanction of two years imprisonment: cf Coleman v Power at [12], [183]. 

42Third, as I have pointed out the word ""offensive"" is used in conjunction with the words ""menacing"" and ""harassing"". This tends to suggest, in my opinion, that the word is directed to conduct more serious than using the postal service to hurt or wound the feelings of a recipient. 

43Fourth, the section makes it clear that the use of the service has to be offensive in the eyes of a reasonable person in all the circumstances. Although this is not relevant to the meaning of the word ""offensive"", it is relevant in my view in considering the answer to the second question posed by Lange . 

44In these circumstances, in my opinion, for the use of a postal service to be offensive within the meaning of s 471.12 it is necessary that the use be calculated or likely to arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust, or hatred in the mind of a reasonable person in all the circumstances. However, it is not sufficient if the use would only hurt or wound the feelings of the recipient, in the mind of a reasonable person. 

45Such a construction, in my opinion, reflects the use of the word ""offensive"" in conjunction with ""menacing"" or ""harassing"", takes into account that it extends to private communications and reflects the level of criminality envisaged by the prescribed maximum penalty. For the reasons which follow, such a construction also, in my opinion, strikes an appropriate balance between the implied freedom of political communication and the rights of persons to be protected from the misuse of the postal service. 

The validity of the provision 

46Prior to dealing with the two questions raised by Lange, it is convenient to deal with the submission made by the respondent to the effect that, in answering these questions, it is necessary to have regard to the actual communications to see whether or not they concern political or governmental matters. 

47In my opinion, this approach is not correct. The relevant questions raised by Lange focus on the validity of the law in question, not whether the activities of persons amount to a political or governmental communication. This follows also from the fact that the implied freedom is a limitation on legislative power, not the grant of an individual right: Roberts v Bass [2002] HCA 57; (2002) 212 CLR 1 at [65]; Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (No 2) [1992] HCA 45; (1992) 177 CLR 106 at 150; Mulholland v Australian Electoral Commission [2004] HCA 41; (2004) 220 CLR 181 at [180]; Hogan v Hinch [2011] HCA 44; (2011) 85 ALJR 398 at [50]. The position was summarised by Hayne J in APLA Ltd v Legal Services Commissioner (NSW) supra in the following terms (at [381]): 

""The implied freedom of political communication is a limitation on legislative power; it is not an individual right. It follows that, in deciding whether the freedom has been infringed, the central question is what the impugned law does, not how an individual might want to construct a particular communication or (in this case) advertisement."" 

48In support of the submission that it was appropriate to have regard to the text of the communication in determining at least the answer to the first question in Lange, the respondent relied on the following passage of the judgment of Gleeson CJ and Heydon J in APLA Ltd v Legal Services Commission (NSW) supra (citations omitted): 

""[28] The possibility that an advertisement of the kind prohibited by the regulations might mention some political or governmental issue, or might name some politician, does not mean that the regulations infringe the constitutional requirement. The regulations do not, in their terms, prohibit communications about government or political matters. They prohibit communication between lawyers and people who, by hypothesis, are not their clients, aimed at encouraging the recipients of the communications to engage the services of lawyers. Such communications are an essentially commercial activity. The regulations are not aimed at preventing discussion of, say, 'tort law reform', or some other such issue of public policy. They restrict the marketing of professional services."" 

49In my opinion, this passage does not support the proposition contended for. Their Honours focused on the regulations in question which prohibited the advertisement of a particular form of legal services in drawing the conclusion that regulations of that nature did not effectively burden communication on governmental or political matters. Gummow J (at [218]) reached a similar conclusion pointing out that whilst it was possible to combine an advertisement to supply legal services with communication about governmental and political matters, it would only be the advertisement which was proscribed. However, if it be the case that offensive material can include communication on governmental and political matters, then such a distinction cannot be drawn in the present case. 

50The respondent also relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal of Western Australia in Holland v The Queen supra in support of its submission. That case involved an appeal against conviction for the importation of pornographic material contrary to certain provisions of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and the regulations thereunder. Although at one point in his judgment (at [49]) Malcolm CJ stated that to come within the area of ""implied immunity"" the communication must relate to a political or governmental matter, he ultimately determined the issue by reference to the validity of the section and regulations generally. His conclusions were expressed in the following paragraphs: 

""[100] In my opinion, the direct purpose of the relevant statutory provisions and regulations in the present case is not to restrict or burden political communication as such in a way that would impermissibly burden or restrict the freedom of communication implied from the relevant sections of the Constitution . The direct purpose of the relevant statutory provisions and regulations is to prohibit the importation of pornographic publications of the kind referred to in reg 4A. These include, in particular, items of child pornography within the meaning of s 233BAB(3) of the Customs Act and publications to which reg 1A applies, namely, that describe and depict, in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, a person who is or looks like a child under 16."" 

and 

[111] I also agree that neither s 233BAB or reg 4A(1)(b), whether expressly or otherwise, impose any impermissible burden or restriction on governmental or political discussion about such matters. They do not impose any relevant prohibition, restriction or restraint upon anyone advocating changes in the relevant law. In short, I agree with Roberts-Smith JA that material of this kind does not constitute any part of legitimate political communication, with the consequence that neither s 233BAB nor reg 4A(1)(b) is invalid because neither of them infringe the implied freedom of political debate under the Constitution."" 

51Roberts-Smith JA adopted a similar approach (at [212], [213], [223]) as did McLure JA (at [303]). 

52It follows, and it is my view, that it is irrelevant to consider the actual communication in order to resolve the matter. 

Does s 471.12 of the Criminal Code effectively burden freedom of communication about governmental or political matters? 

53The first question posed by Lange is whether the law in question effectively burdens freedom of communication about governmental or political matters either in terms of operation or effect. 

54In this regard it must be borne in mind that the scope of the communication on governmental and political matters is wide. In Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd [1994] HCA 46; (1994) 182 CLR 104 at 124, Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ stated that the implied freedom covers ""all speech relevant to the development of public opinion on the whole range of issues which an intelligent citizen should think about"". In Hogan v Hinch supra at [49], French CJ stated that the range of matters that may be characterised as ""governmental and political matters"" for the purpose of the implied freedom is broad and ""arguably include social and economic features of Australian society"". 

55In Coleman v Power , it was conceded that the provisions of s 7(1)(d) of the Vagrants, Gaming and Other Offences Act 1931 (Qld), which prohibited the use of insulting words to any person in a public place, effectively burdened governmental or political communication within the first limb of Lange . That concession was accepted by a majority of the Court: at [27] per Gleeson CJ; [79]-[81] per McHugh J; [197] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; [230] per Kirby J. McHugh and Kirby JJ expressly stated the concession to be correct. Callinan J (at [298]) stated the concession was incorrect, whilst Heydon J (at [319]) stated that it would have been necessary to examine the correctness of the concession if the outcome of the appeal, in his opinion, turned on its correctness. His Honour held the law was valid in any event. 

56Notwithstanding the meaning I have attributed to the word ""offensive"" in s 471.12, in my opinion, the law does effectively burden freedom of communication about governmental and political matters. The restriction it imposes at least limits the nature of political and governmental communications through a wide variety of postal and similar services. It does not seem to me to be sufficiently insubstantial so as not to amount to an effective burden on the freedom of communication of such matters. It has been recognised that in this country political debate can take place in a fashion that is generally robust, frequently insulting and sometimes acrimonious: See Coleman v Power at [105], [237]-[239]. Section 471.12 of the Criminal Code even interpreted the way I suggest would limit the form if not the substance of such communications. It does not seem to me possible to say the burden would be insubstantial. 

57It follows that the first question posed by Lange should be answered in the affirmative. 

Is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end in a manner compatible with the maintenance of the system of government prescribed by the Constitution? 

58As I indicated earlier the primary judge held that the section had two purposes. The first was to protect the integrity of the post both physically and as a means of communication in which the public could have confidence. I am unable to accept this conclusion. First, the integrity of a postal or similar service is expressly dealt with in s 471.13 and offensive material would not threaten the physical integrity of the post. Second, the suggested purpose of maintaining confidence in the integrity of the postal system is a somewhat ephemeral concept particularly having regard to the wide variety of services to which the section could apply. It does not seem to me that the legislative purpose in prohibiting the dissemination of offensive material was to protect such integrity - presumably of its efficiency and reliability. 

59Her Honour also held that the second purpose was to protect breaches of the peace which may flow from the receipt of offensive material and protect the recipients from harm. In my opinion, the purpose of s 471.12 can be shortly stated. It is to protect persons first, from being menaced by use of a postal service. Second, it is to protect persons being harassed by the use of such a service and third, to protect persons from being subjected to material that is offensive in the sense I have described, namely material which is calculated or likely to arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust or hatred in the mind of a reasonable person. It can be inferred that the legislature considered such protection necessary having regard to features unique to a postal service including first the fact that the post is generally sent to a person's home or business address and therefore personalised, and second that material sent by post is often unable to be avoided in the ordinary course of things, given it is the norm to open all of the mail addressed to an individual. A recipient of material sent by post essentially is a captive audience. 

60In considering whether or not the law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve that end in the manner which is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government, there are a number of matters to be borne in mind. First, the freedom is not absolute. In Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth (No 2) supra, Deane and Toohey JJ emphasised (at 169) that it was not an absolute and uncontrolled licence but an implication of freedom under the law of an ordered and democratic society: See also Cunliffe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1994] HCA 44; (1994) 182 CLR 272 at 336-337. In Lange the Court summarised the position as follows (565-566, citations omitted): 

""Similarly, the content of the freedom to discuss government and political matters must be ascertained according to what is for the common convenience and welfare of society. That requires an examination of changing circumstances and the need to strike a balance in those circumstances between absolute freedom of discussion of government and politics and the reasonable protection of the persons who may be involved, directly or incidentally, in the activities of government or politics."" 

61Second, in determining whether a law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to a legitimate end the question for the court is not whether some choice other than that made by Parliament was preferable or desirable but whether the parliamentary choice was reasonable in light of the burden placed on the constitutional freedom of communication. The role of the court is to ask whether Parliament's enactment is a reasonable means of achieving its purpose, keeping in mind the importance of constitutional freedoms: Levy v State of Victoria [1997] HCA 32; (1997) 189 CLR 579 at 598, 608, 614-5, 618-620, 627-628 and 647-648; Mulholland v Australian Electoral Commission supra at [32]-[33], [234]-[239], [256]-[257], [360]; Coleman v Power at [31], [100], [292] and [328]. 

62Third, in this context the distinction has been drawn between legislation the direct purpose of which is to restrict political communications and that which only incidentally restricts such communication. The distinction was drawn by Gaudron J in Levy v State of Victoria supra in the following terms (at 619, citation omitted): 

""If the direct purpose of the law is to restrict political communication, it is valid only if necessary for the attainment of some overriding public purpose. If, on the other hand, it has some other purpose, connected with a subject matter within power and only incidentally restricts political communication, it is valid if it is reasonably appropriate and adapted to that other purpose."" 

63In the case of legislation which only incidentally affects political communication, the court will not strike down a law which may incidentally burden freedom of political speech simply because it could be shown that some more limited restriction could achieve that purpose: Coleman v Power at [31]. 

64In the present case, it seems to me that offensive communications of the nature which I have described, namely ones calculated or likely to arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust or hatred in the mind of a reasonable person in all the circumstances, would be communications which could provoke retaliation and thus be legitimate for Parliament to prohibit. 

65Further, accepting that communications through the post are less likely to provoke retaliation than spoken words, it seems to me it is a legitimate end to protect recipients of postal articles from such material and that such protection is compatible with the maintenance of the system of government prescribed by the Constitution. The only political or governmental communications which would be affected would be those calculated or likely to arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust or hatred in the mind of a reasonable person in all the circumstances. Such a reasonable person, in my opinion, would be aware of the robust nature of political debate referred to by McHugh and Kirby JJ in Coleman v Power , and would not be offended by it in the sense I have described. Political and governmental communications would only be proscribed when they cross that boundary and arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust or hatred in the mind of a reasonable person. It seems to me that in those circumstances the legislation is reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve the end of protecting use of the post in a manner compatible with the system of government prescribed by the Constitution. 

66What I have said is consistent, in my opinion, with the reasoning of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ, and Kirby J in Coleman v Power . Each of their Honours held that the prohibition on the use of insulting words in a public place properly construed was compatible with the maintenance of the system of government prescribed by the Constitution. Gleeson CJ (at [14]) said that the language in question must be of such a nature that its use in the place where it is spoken is contrary to contemporary standards of good order and goes beyond what, by those standards, is simply an exercise of freedom to express opinions on political matters. The construction of the word ""offensive"" which I have suggested in the present case achieves a similar end. 

67Gummow and Hayne JJ and Kirby J construed the expression ""insulting words in a public place"" to mean words intended to provoke unlawful physical retaliation or likely to provoke unlawful physical retaliation: at [183] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; at [254] per Kirby J. Although the likelihood of physical retaliation is less in the case of a private communication through a postal service than in the case of words uttered in a public place, words which are calculated or would be likely to arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust or hatred in the mind of a reasonable person have the potential to provoke physical retaliation and at the very least cause an emotional reaction in the recipient from which the recipient is entitled to protection. Such a limitation does not impose a significant fetter on political communication that would ordinarily be expected to take place in an ordered democratic society, and to the extent that it does limit such communications it is not incompatible with the maintenance of the system of government prescribed by the Constitution. 

68It follows that the second question posed by Lange should be answered in the affirmative. 

Conclusion 

69For these reasons, the appeals should be dismissed. 

70ALLSOP P: I have read the reasons of the Chief Justice. It is unnecessary for me to repeat any background material dealt with by him. I agree with the orders proposed by him and with much of his reasoning. I prefer to express my own reasons. 

71As made clear in Coleman v Power [2004] HCA 39; 220 CLR 1 at 21 [3] (Gleeson CJ), 64 [147] and 68 [158], (Gummow J and Hayne J), 84 [219] (Kirby J) and 115 [306] (Heydon J), the first step in any analysis as to whether a law of a Parliament infringes the implied Constitutional freedom of political communication is to construe the relevant provision. Once construed, the two-stage test in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; 189 CLR 520 (as modified in Coleman ) is to be applied, as set out in the Chief Justice's reasons. 

72The process of statutory construction involves the ascription of meaning to the words used by Parliament using all relevant rules of statutory construction, both common law and statutory. A number of such principles are relevant here. First, s 471.12 is a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for up to two years. It would be wrong to attribute to Parliament an intention to criminalise conduct to this extent unless it was of a serious character. This can be seen as an incident of the principle of legality that the community's entitlement of free expression is not to be abrogated or truncated otherwise than by clear expression and that the law has to take due account of the rights and freedoms of citizens and those within the country: Melser v Police [1967] NZLR 437 at 443-446; Coleman at 25 [11]-[12] (Gleeson CJ). 

73Secondly, the word offensive takes its meaning from its context. Here, the linking of the words ""menacing, harassing or offensive"" indicates that they should be understood as informing the meaning of each other by their collocation and textual context: Evans v Stevens (1791) 4 TR 224 at 227; 100 ER 986 at 987, cited by Spigelman CJ in Lend Lease Real Estate Investments Ltd v GPT RE Ltd [2006] NSWCA 207 at [30]; D C Pearce and R S Geddes Statutory Interpretation in Australia (7 th Ed, 2011) at 135 [4.25]. Textual context in this sense is particularly important where a word (such as ""offensive"" here) has a broad scope of possible meaning or many shades of meaning: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Applegate (1979) 38 FLR 1 at 11 and 16-17 (Fisher J). Here, the nearby words in the same provision are ""menacing"" and ""harassing"". Both have an element of personal direction at the recipient of the post; both contain an element of calculated conduct, though objective in character; both have a serious quality of objectionability in civil society. 

74The context of the section is Div 471 entitled ""Postal Offences"". Surrounding provisions deal with serious subject matters: hoaxes involving explosives and dangerous substances: s 471.10; threats: s 471.11; dangerous articles: s 471.13; explosives or dangerous or harmful substances: s 471.15. 

75As a provision concerned with the postal or similar service, whether public or private (see s 470.1), the provision is directed to a service that brings communications into the homes or places of work or business of people, generally in envelopes or packages that will be opened by the person to whom the communication is addressed. Thus, the seriousness of the use of the postal service that brings into the personal domain of an addressee a communication that is menacing or harassing or offensive is derived, in part, from the invasion of that personal domain of the addressee. 

76Thirdly, the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 15A, requires that the provision be read subject to the Constitution and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth; see also Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club Inc v The Commissioner of Police [2008] HCA 4; 234 CLR 532 at 553 [11] (Gummow J, Hayne J, Heydon J and Kiefel J) and New South Wales v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 52; 229 CLR 1 at 161-162 [355] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow J, Hayne J, Heydon J and Crennan J). Relevantly, here, the provision should be read, if possible, in a way that will not offend the implied freedom of political communication. This consideration will affect the content of the notion of offensive in s 471.12, in the light of the purpose of the provision. It is to be noted, however, that the operation of the provision of itself caters, to a degree, for the Constitutional principle. The offending conduct must be such that reasonable persons would regard, in all the circumstances, the use as offensive. Such circumstances would be taken to include the recognition by reasonable persons of the existence and importance to Australian democracy and representative government of the freedom and thus of a possibly legitimate purpose for the use of the post, even if the use, through the communication, may offend the recipient of the communication. 

77This last rule of construction thus ties the process of ascription of meaning to the provision in question closely to the operation and consideration of the two-stage test in Lange and Coleman . This is especially so where, as here, one has a broad relative concept, such as ""offensive"". The process of construction or reading down can be done within a broad scope of content of meaning of such a word to a relevant content, if any, as would not lead to constitutional invalidity. Of course, if competing considerations make such a reading down impermissible as contrary to the proper meaning of the word, then the Court is not permitted to rewrite the section. It is construction of the words of Parliament that is the task being engaged in, not legislative drafting. 

78The purpose of the provision was said by the Director of Public Prosecutions to be ""the integrity of the post"". The appellants' submissions tended to deride this expression of the matter as inappropriately vesting services with some animate form or essence. I respectfully disagree with that criticism. Part of an ordered and civil society involves communications that come to individuals, personally addressed to them, at their homes or other places by some form of postal service. Use of the postal service that is menacing, harassing, or offensive intrudes upon members of the community in a way which could undermine a sense of civil peace and security by permitting the intrusion of such communications into the lives of members of the community, without warning and without their consent. It is legitimate in the maintenance of an orderly, peaceful, civil and culturally diverse society such as Australia that services that bring communications into the homes and offices of people should not be such as to undermine or threaten a legitimate sense of safety or security of domain, and thus public confidence in such services. 

79The above is the context in which to give meaning and content to the word ""offensive"" in s 471.12. The word ""offensive"" is a relative descriptor. It is, of course, the way the postal service is used that is to be offensive - not that someone is in fact, or may be, offended by a communication sent via the post. The character of the use is the question - by reference to an objective standard: see the discussion in the note by Mr Hutley (as his Honour then was) in (1941) 14 Australian Law Journal 384 at 385. A standard is required for the assessment by reasonable persons, in all the circumstances, of the intrinsic quality of the act: Anderson v Kynaston [1924] VLR 214 at 217 (Cussen ACJ), Ball v McIntyre (1966) 9 FLR 237 at 240-241 (Kerr J) and R v Burgmann (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 May 1973, unreported), in particular, Jacobs P. To predicate satisfaction of a provision such as s 471.12, insofar as it refers to ""offensive"", on the finding that the person to whom the communication was made was offended would be an intolerably wide meaning for a criminal provision. The use of the service must be offensive in a serious way and judged so intrinsically by reference to a standard against which the quality of the communication sent via the post can be judged. The need for a standard to assess the quality of the act in question is assisted by the requirement that it is what reasonable persons in all the circumstances would regard as offensive use of a postal service. Thus, as Mr Hutley said in his note at 385, this excludes the citizen ""lacking the vanity of the Coroner in Ex parte Collier [(1877) 1 Knox (NSW) 513] or the touchiness in money matters of the prosecutor in Sellers v Bishop [(1905) 11 ALR (CN) 61] or the exaggerated sense of personal rectitude of the prosecutor in Windred v Manion [(1918) 14 Tas LR 36]"". 

80One is assisted in the task of ascription of meaning to the word ""offensive"" here by the consideration of cases such as Worcester v Smith [1951] VLR 316, Ball v McIntyre , R v Burgmann and Inglis v Fish [1961] VR 607, as discussed by the Chief Justice. The word ""offensive"" is capable of encompassing within its meaning the sense that the act or communication is such as to cause, amongst other things, hurt or wounding. It also encompasses the sense that the act or omission is such as to cause or arouse anger, outrage, resentment, disgust or hatred. How wide the meaning should be taken to be in the context of the implied political freedom requires an appreciation of the potential scope of the political freedom. 

81The impact of the implied freedom on construction depends upon the extent to which the communications protected by the Constitutional freedom could be expected to fall within the meaning of the provision. The freedom is derived from the text and structure of the Constitution and the form of representative government provided for in the Constitution: Lange at 560. The freedom, so textually founded, is to protect choice inhering in the election of representatives by the ensuring of ""an opportunity to gain an appreciation of the available alternatives"": Lange at 560, citing Dawson J in Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1992] HCA 45; 177 CLR 106 at 187. The election is of representatives to pass laws in Parliament, the constitutionality of which is, at root, founded on their rational character: Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2; 211 CLR 476 at 512-513 [101]-[102] (Gaudron J, McHugh J, Gummow J, Kirby J and Hayne J), made after rational debate, which laws are to be administered by the Executive reasonably and in good faith, and adjudicated upon by an independent judiciary reasoning according to rational, fair and just criteria. The freedom is not absolute or an uncontrolled licence, but an implication of freedom under law of an ordered and democratic society: Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1992] HCA 45; 177 CLR 106 at 169 (Deane J and Toohey J) for the protection of a system of government of laws and not men, through the free choice of representatives in order that they might make rational coherent law and guide or lead an ordered civil society. In these circumstances, it was available to conclude that the communications so protected were of rational and reasoned debate, even though such debate might be ""full, compelling, trenchant, robust, passionate, indecorous, acrimonious and even rancorous"": Coleman at 125 [330] (Heydon J). The consequence of this view would be that there was no call for the protection of communications that are calculated to cause significant anger, significant resentment, disgust, outrage or hatred. 

82That, however, is not the limit of the protection. In Coleman , McHugh J said at 54 [105] the following: 

""The use of insulting words is a common enough technique in political discussion and debates. No doubt speakers and writers sometimes use them as weapons of intimidation. And whether insulting words are or are not used for the purpose of intimidation, fear of insult may have a chilling effect on political debate. However, as I have indicated, insults are a legitimate part of the political discussion protected by the Constitution. An unqualified prohibition on their use cannot be justified as compatible with the constitutional freedom. Such a prohibition goes beyond anything that could be regarded as reasonably appropriate and adapted to maintaining the system of representative government."" 


It is, with respect, not clear whether Gummow J and Hayne J at 77 [195] agreed with this paragraph when they said that the freedom described in Lange operated on the common law and the legislative authority of the polities in the manner described by McHugh J. In any event, they themselves said at 78 [197] that insult and invective are well-known forms of political communication. Kirby J at 91 [239] said that insult, emotion, calumny and invective are part of the ""armoury"" of political persuasion and the struggle for ideas. Political communication may, as Gleeson CJ said in Coleman at 31 [28] include ""indecency, obscenity, profanity, threats, abuse, insults and offensiveness"" (though the Chief Justice was not of the view that the implied political freedom necessarily protected such communications, indeed to the contrary). 

83Recognising the scope of the protection referred to by McHugh J, Gummow J, Kirby J and Hayne J in Coleman , the word ""offensive"" in s 471.12 should not extend to use of a character calculated to cause hurt or injury to feelings or even to wound. The seriousness and gravity of the notion of offensive in this context should be limited, at least, as the Chief Justice says to use of a character objectively calculated or likely to cause or arouse significant anger, significant resentment, disgust, outrage or hatred. 

84So provisionally construed, is the provision valid? Does the law, so construed, effectively burden freedom of communication about government or political matters by its terms, operation or effect? The provision is not one that by its purpose is directed to communications about government or political matters: cf Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth at 143 (Mason CJ), 169 (Deane J and Toohey J) and 234-235 (McHugh J); Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills [1992] HCA 46; 177 CLR 1 at 76-77 (Deane J and Toohey J); Cunliffe v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 44; 182 CLR 272 at 299-300 (Mason CJ), 337-339 (Deane J) and 388 (Gaudron J); and Levy v Victoria [1997] HCA 31; 189 CLR 579 at 618-619 (Gaudron J). Nevertheless, it criminalises the use of the postal services for types of communications. Undoubtedly, the postal services are essential mechanisms by which communication about political and governmental matters are carried out and made. Even if one limits the matters to those to which I have referred above, given the potential scope of political communication, the provision would effectively burden freedom of communication about governmental or political matters. Some political communications may, by their very nature, be objectively calculated or likely to cause or arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust or hatred. The question as to the provision's validity is whether it is reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end in a manner which is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government and the procedure prescribed by s 128 of the Constitution for submitting a proposed amendment of the Constitution to the informed decision of the people. 

85I have earlier described what I consider to be the legitimate end of the provision in respect of the postal services. Is the provision adapted to serve that end in the compatible manner? It would clearly not be if it criminalised any use of the post to communicate material that would or might offend some people. That is not, however, the content of the conduct criminalised as I have suggested. 

86One can readily contemplate political communications sent by the post that are calculated to cause or arouse significant anger, significant resentment, disgust, outrage or even hatred. This is conduct that might in the eye of the sender of the communication aptly polarise and bring to public attention the extreme or unpopular view of the sender. A sense of anger, outrage, resentment, disgust or hatred caused by the making of the communication may be the perceived change to political consciousness or a step along that path that is thought to be required. This may be attempted by many means, including abusive or hurtful statements. Parties are free to communicate in the way described by McHugh J, Gummow J, Kirby J and Hayne J in Coleman . Accepting this, the criminalising of conduct that is objectively calculated or likely to cause or arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust or hatred may be seen to strike at a range of a legitimate type of communications on political or governmental matters. 

87That said and accepted, it is necessary to recognise that an important feature of the post is that it enters into the home or place of work or business of the recipient as an addressee (even if some addressees may be generic such as 'the householder'). A distinction may be drawn between the general freedom to distribute information on political and governmental matters and forcing upon people in their own homes or domains by use of the post information calculated to offend in the way that I have described. There may be seen to be a clear interest in prohibiting intrusion into the homes, workplaces and private domains of people of communications calculated to offend in this way; cf Rowan v United States Post Office Department 397 US 728 at 736-737 (1970) and Cohen v California 403 US 15 (1971). 

88The question is whether the protection of the citizen from the invasion into his or her home or domain by unwanted and unrequested communications calculated or likely to offend in the way that I have described is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government. Limited in the way I have suggested: use of the postal service of a character objectively calculated or likely to cause or arouse significant anger, significant resentment, disgust, outrage or hatred, the provision is reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve the end of maintaining confidence in the postal services bringing communications to people in their homes, workplaces or personal domains. The difficulty is whether it is so adapted in a manner that is compatible with the ends of the freedom protected. This is an evaluation of some difficulty. I was initially of the view that even so construed the criminalisation of conduct potentially within the scope of political or government communications meant that the provision was not compatible with the ends that the freedom seeks to maintain. It would, for instance, risk making criminal the use of the post to send to all people or a large group of people a communication on governmental or political matters that would be objectively calculated or likely to cause significant anger, significant resentment, disgust, outrage or hatred by expression of strongly held and bitterly opposed beliefs. The tribunal of fact would, of course, be required to recognise that one of the circumstances that reasonable persons would take into account would be the recognition of the existence and importance of the freedom of political expression. 

89One way of reading the provision that would perhaps be seen as ensuring its validity would be to give an even narrower content to ""offensive"", though still conformable with its legitimate linguistic and contextual meaning. An additional qualification could be added, being one that takes an element of meaning from the surrounding words of ""menacing"" and ""harassing"" by being directed to an additional requirement of causing of real emotional or mental harm, distress or anguish to the addressee. This would see the word ""offensive"" mean ""use of the postal service in a manner or of a character objectively calculated or likely (a) to cause or arouse significant anger, significant resentment, disgust, outrage or hatred and (b) to cause real emotional or mental harm, distress or anguish thereby"". 

90So further limited, the provision would provide a positive answer to the second Lange question. One can engage in political communication of the most robust, insulting and disgusting character without being calculated or likely to cause real emotional or mental harm or distress or anguish thereby, to recipients of communications in the post. It is one thing for a communication to be calculated or likely to cause or arouse significant anger, significant resentment, outrage, disgust or hatred. It is another for it to be also objectively calculated or likely to harm emotionally or mentally in a real way thereby through the use of the postal service carrying communications into the home or personal domain of an addressee of a communication. 

91It must, however, be recalled that this is a process of statutory construction and not legislative drafting. In the end, I am content to rest with the meaning of ""offensive"" proposed by the Chief Justice. Though there is a not insignificant potential impact upon communications that could be on political or governmental matters, the considerations of the protection of the confidence of people using the postal services and the prevention of a sense of invasion into the lives of addressees or recipients of post, uncalled for and uninvited, through the postal services are such as to make the means compatible in the relevant respects called for. Persons can offend in the way proscribed by s 471.12 without using the post: cf Cohen v California at 21 and Rowan v Post Office Dept at 738. 

92For these reasons I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice. 

93McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the considerable benefit of reading in draft the reasons of the Chief Justice and the President. 

94The appellants have been prosecuted for an alleged breach of s 471.12 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). That section makes it an offence to use a postal service in a way ""(whether by the method of use or the content of the communication, or both) that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, menacing, harassing or offensive."" 

95The appellants submitted that the indictment under which the respondent seeks to have them tried should be quashed because it infringes the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. The appellants' argument relies upon the High Court's confirmation of the protection by the Commonwealth Constitution of the freedom of communication between people concerning political or government matters ( Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; (1997) 189 CLR 520). The freedom is not absolute but ""is limited to what is necessary for the effective operation of that system of representative and responsible government provided for by the Constitution"" (at p 561). 

""The freedom will not invalidate a law enacted to satisfy some other legitimate end if the law satisfies two conditions. The first condition is that the object of the law is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government or the procedure for submitting a proposed amendment to the Constitution to the informed decision of the people which the Constitution prescribes. The second is that the law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to achieving that legitimate object or end."" (p 561-562) 

96Two questions arise ( Lange at p 567-568 Coleman v Power [2004] HCA 39; 220 CLR 1 at [93]-[96]). The first question is whether s 471.12 of the Criminal Code has the effect of burdening the freedom of communication about government or political matters. The primary judge answered this question in the affirmative. The appellants and the Solicitor General for the State of New South Wales who intervened agree with that answer. The Director of Public Prosecutions (""DPP"") contends to the contrary. 

97The second question is whether the section is reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end the fulfilment of which is compatible with the maintenance of the system of government prescribed by the Constitution. Her Honour also answered this question in the affirmative. The appellants contend to the contrary. 

98Section 471.12 was added to the Criminal Code in 2002. Accordingly, it may be assumed that the Parliament when enacting the amendment was mindful of the High Court's decision in Lange . 

99The section does not proscribe all conduct of the relevant kind but only that which ""reasonable persons"" would regard in all the circumstances as having the relevant character. The reasonable person test is of course a formulation utilised in many areas of the law, including the criminal law. In the present context the reasonable person will be attributed with knowledge of the Australian system of government and with the nature of political discourse within the Commonwealth and otherwise with a knowledge of acceptable contemporary norms of written communication between persons. 

100The Macquarie Dictionary defines ""menacing"" as conduct which imports a threat to cause harm or injury. To ""harass"" would be commonly understood as meaning to ""trouble by repeated attacks"" (Macquarie Dictionary). ""Offensive"", in the present context, (which would obviously exclude the use of the term in relation to war), is given meaning by the dictionary covering the range from ""causing offence or displeasure to repugnancy in the moral sense or insulting"" (Macquarie Dictionary). 

101The argument in the present case was not concerned with the consequence of the inclusion of the words ""menacing"" or ""harassing"" in the section but with the word ""offensive."" As Gleeson CJ said in Coleman v Power (2004) 220 CLR 1 at [12] concepts of what is offensive will vary with time and place and may be affected by the circumstances in which the relevant conduct occurs. In Ball v McIntyre (1996) 9 FLR 237 to which Gleeson CJ referred in Coleman, Kerr J held that the conduct of a demonstration against the Vietnam war which may have been offensive to some people was not offensive within the meaning of the relevant statute. 

102Some of the judges in Coleman discussed the reach of communications which are protected by the implied freedom of political communication. In Australia communications concerning political or governmental matters may be ""insulting,"" ""biting"" or ""offensive"" (McHugh J at [81]). Australian politics ""has regularly included insult and emotion, calumny and invective"" (Kirby J at [239]). Their Honours' approach may be described as robust. 

103Heydon J adopted a more refined approach to what might constitute legitimate political discourse. His Honour said: 

""To address insulting words to persons in a public place is conduct sufficiently alien to the virtues of the free and informed debate on which the constitutional freedom rests that it falls outside it"" [332]. 

104Kirby J responded to Heydon J in these terms (at [238]-[239]): 

""Reading the description of civilised interchange about governmental and political matters in the reasons of Heydon J, I had difficulty in recognising the Australian political system as I know it. His Honour's chronicle appears more like a description of an intellectual salon where civility always (or usually) prevails. It is not, with respect, an accurate description of the Australian governmental and political system in action. 

One might wish for more rationality, less superficiality, diminished invective and increased logic and persuasion in political discourse. But those of that view must find another homeland. From its earliest history, Australian politics has regularly included insult and emotion, calumny and invective, in its armoury of persuasion. They are part and parcel of the struggle of ideas. Anyone in doubt should listen for an hour or two to the broadcasts that bring debates of the Federal Parliament to the living rooms of the nation. This is the way present and potential elected representatives have long campaigned in Australia for the votes of constituents and the support of their policies. It is unlikely to change. By protecting from legislative burdens governmental and political communications in Australia, the Constitution addresses the nation's representative government as it is practised. It does not protect only the whispered civilities of intellectual discourse. 'Insulting' therefore requires a more limited interpretation in order for s 7(1)(d) to be read so as not to infringe the constitutional freedom defined in Lange. "" 

105Although Heydon J's views as to the limit of legitimate political communication were not shared by the other members of the court, his Honour's remark makes plain that there are limits to the level of offence which may be occasioned by a protected communication. If that limit is passed, the implied constitutional freedom will not protect the maker of the statement. 

106Section 471.12 creates a criminal offence and must be understood in that context. When determining the reach of the section it must be borne in mind that the reasonable person will be mindful of the robust nature of political debate in this country when considering whether in the circumstances of the particular case the use of the postal service was menacing, harassing or offensive. 

107It is not difficult to accept that if the postal service was used to forward faeces to another, even in pursuance of a political objective or in making a political statement, reasonable persons would find that use of the postal service to be offensive within the section. If the level of invective in any postal communication was such as to cause psychological injury to an otherwise reasonably robust personality or tend to invite a spontaneous response in breach of the peace, reasonable persons may also regard that use as relevantly offensive. This conclusion will follow from the fact that the reasonable person would consider that the offence occasioned by these uses of the service has the consequence that they fall outside the limits of legitimate political debate. 

108It is unnecessary to decide whether any communication touching upon matters of politics or government, however extreme, is a communication about government or political matters and will fall within the first limb in Lange. For present purposes I accept that it is, although the contrary argument has merit. Accordingly, for present purposes however menacing, harassing or offensive such a communication it would nevertheless be a communication which is prima facie protected by the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. 

109The question in the present case is whether the section is a reasonably appropriate response fairly adapted to meet the legitimate end of regulating the postal service which is compatible with the system of government proscribed by the constitution ( Lange at 562). To prohibit the use of the mail service in the Dictionary sense of to offend, ie cause displeasure, insult or occasion displeasure in the moral sense would clearly infringe the implied constitutional freedom of political communication and would be incompatible with the maintenance of the system of government prescribed by the Constitution. 

110The consideration of previous decisions referred to by the Chief Justice, which I have found of assistance and need not repeat, reveals the problems which the courts have faced in giving meaning to legislation which criminalises offensive behaviour. Without any statutory indication of the standard against which to assess the quality of the particular conduct the task has proved to be difficult. It can only be undertaken by attempting to identify particular characteristics of the conduct or its possible consequences. 

111In Coleman , the High Court, by majority, rejected the challenge to the validity of the relevant section of the Vagrants, Gaming and Other Offences Act 1931 (Qld). Gummow and Hayne JJ arrived at this conclusion by confining the operation of the section to words used in a public place which are provocative ""in the sense that either they are intended to provoke unlawful physical retaliation or they are reasonably likely to provoke unlawful physical retaliation"" [183] from another person. Construed in this manner the section was reasonably appropriate and adapted to keeping public places free from violence and accordingly compatible within the maintenance of the system of government provided by the Constitution. 

112Kirby J confined the operation of the section ""to the use in or near a public place of threatening, abusive or insulting words that go beyond hurting personal feelings and involve words that are reasonably likely to provoke unlawful physical retaliation"" and accordingly the section did not ""diminish, disproportionately, the federal system of representative and responsible government"" [256] (see also Callinan J [298]). 

113McHugh J took a different view. His Honour did not accept the submission of the Solicitor-General for Queensland to the effect that the object of the relevant section was to proscribe statements which may provoke a breach of the peace. His Honour also rejected the proposition that the relevant section was aimed at removing threats, abuse and insults from the area of public discussion, so that persons would not be intimidated into silence [101]. 

114The actual decision as opposed to the principles discussed in Coleman is of little assistance when construing s 471.12. The offering of an insult or the making of a statement which causes offence in a public place may, as the majority said in Coleman, lead to a breach of the peace which it is proper for the criminal law to endeavour to seek to avoid and for that purpose provide a relevant offence. However, it may be different when the communication is made in private and through the postal service. 

115The postal service is provided to facilitate personal, business and other communication. A great many, indeed the overwhelming frequency of its uses, will be for purposes entirely unrelated or only incidental to any matter relating to politics. The reasonable person will be aware of the nature and purpose of the service. Such a person will also be aware of the robust nature of accepted political discourse in Australia. 

116There can be no doubt that the communications the subject of the present proceedings would be grossly offensive to many people whether the intended recipient of the communication or otherwise. However, the validity of the section cannot be assessed by considering the context of a particular communication or its capacity to cause displeasure, insult or engender moral outrage or harm an individual. History is replete with occasions when the expression of views which occasion moral outrage in one generation pass with little comment in another. Communications intended to incite a physical response occasioning harm to an individual or group may be universally condemned in any generation but those which offend or hurt feelings or occasion moral outrage may not have the same quality. However, it is not for this Court to express an opinion as to the character of the alleged conduct of the appellants. That will be a matter for the jury at any trial. 

117As I have previously emphasised, before there can be a breach of s 471.2 the use made of the postal service must be a use in a way which a reasonable person would regard as offensive. This was the approach suggested by Mr Hutley to be necessary if legislation proscribing offensive conduct is to have effective operation (14 ALJ 384). This was also the issue emphasised by Reynolds JA in R v Burgmann (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 May 1973, unreported). 

118As I understand the view of the majority in Coleman the Parliament is entitled by statute to provide a boundary beyond which political or government communications may be constrained as a breach of the criminal law. However, in the present context given the robust nature of legitimate political or governmental communications, before any statutory control will be valid it must operate to allow the accepted latitude in the use of the postal service. To my mind s 471.12 conforms to this requirement. A political communication which in the ordinary meaning of the word is offensive does not fall within the section. The section will only be breached if reasonable persons, being persons who are mindful of the robust nature of political debate in Australia and who have considered the accepted boundaries of that debate, would conclude that the particular use of the postal service is offensive. 

119In my opinion the section is reasonably appropriate and compatible with the system of government prescribed by the Constitution. 

120I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice.

		08 December 2011",2011-12-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708823,Hartman v R [2011] NSWCCA 261,"Judgment  1THE COURT: This is an application for leave to appeal by John Joseph Hartman (""the applicant"").  It relates to sentences imposed by his Honour Justice McClellan CJ at CL (the sentencing judge) on 2 December 2010 ( R v Hartman (2010) 81 ACSR 121; [2010] NSWSC 1422).  2The applicant had pleaded guilty to nineteen charges of insider trading contrary to ss 1043A(1) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Counts 1-19) and six charges of communicating inside information contrary to ss 1043A(2) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act (Counts 20-25).  The applicant also admitted his guilt in relation to further charges of a like kind that were listed on a schedule.  The additional insider trading matters were taken into account in the sentence imposed for Count 1, while the additional 'tipping' matters were taken into account in the sentence imposed for Count 20.  Each offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years and/or a maximum fine of $220,000.  3In general terms, the applicant had traded with, and communicated to another person, inside information over an 18-month period.  This was between about the middle of 2007 and up to early January 2009.  The ""information"" consisted of targets set for the acquisition and disposal of shares.  These targets were set by the applicant's employer Orion Asset Management Limited (Orion).  The applicant was employed by Orion as an equities dealer.  In that capacity, he acquired the ""information"" of the target set by Orion's portfolio managers.  The applicant used the information to engage in ""front-running""; off-market trading in Contracts for Difference (CFDs).  This occurred from about the middle of 2008 to January 2009.  Earlier, from mid 2007 to mid 2008, the applicant had passed inside information to a close friend (Mr Curtis) knowing that he would acquire CFD's in the relevant stock (the tipping offences).  Prior to sentence, the applicant had consented to forfeiture of $1,575,949.43 under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). This represented the substantial portion of the total profit particularised in the charges.  4The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of four and a half years.  A single non-parole period of three years was fixed.  The non-parole period commenced on 2 December 2010 and is to expire on 1 December 2013.  The individual sentences imposed on the applicant were as follows:  Count #1   3 years imprisonment  Commenced: 2.12.10  Expires: 1.12.13  Counts #2-19 2 years imprisonment Commenced:  2.12.10  Expires: 1.12.12  Count #20  2 years imprisonment Commences: 2.6.13  Expires: 1.6.15  Counts #21-25 18 months imprisonment Commences: 2.6.13  Expires:  1.12.14  5The insider trading sentences were made concurrent with one another, as were the tipping sentences.  The latter, however, were then partially accumulated upon the sentence for Count 1.  The sentence structure involves a substantial measure of accumulation between the two groups of sentences.  The tipping sentences share only six months of concurrency with the sentence for Count 1 and they commence after the expiration of the sentences for Counts 2-19.  Grounds of Appeal  6The applicant contends that the sentences imposed upon him were unduly severe in all the circumstances of the case such that lesser sentences are warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 .  The particulars of error contained in the Grounds of Appeal are as follows:  (1) The Sentencing Judge erred in the manner in which he had regard to the applicant's assistance to the authorities.  (2) The sentence for the group offences did not adequately reflect the applicant's assistance to authorities.  (3) The Sentencing Judge erred by failing to have regard to the applicant's demonstrated contrition.  (4) The Sentencing Judge erred by determining that there was a need to reflect general deterrence in the sentence passed upon the applicant.  7(On the hearing of the application for Leave to Appeal, Ground 4 was modified.  It was argued that the Sentencing Judge placed too much weight on the aspect of general deterrence and had failed to give adequate weight to the applicant's subjective circumstances.  In other words, it was conceded that there was a need to reflect general deterrence in the sentences but that this aspect of the sentence was modified by other matters, particularly the applicant's mental health problems).  Facts Relating to the Offences  8There was an agreed statement of facts before the Sentencing Judge.  Its contents are set out in full in his Honour's remarks on sentence.  We shall briefly summarise the relevant facts.  9The applicant commenced employment as an equities dealer at Orion on 27 March 2006.  He was then 20 years of age.  His task involved the buying and selling of shares to align the target and actual weight of shares held on behalf of Orion's clients.  He would do this through a number of brokers utilised for this purpose by Orion.  10The stocks were bought and sold by Orion as fund manager on behalf of its clients.  The level of stock held by Orion in any particular security was the ongoing responsibility of Orion's portfolio managers.  It was they who set targets for the acquisition or disposal of specific stocks in order for Orion to maintain the best possible stock portfolio on behalf of its clients.  The desired level of acquisition or disposal or particulars stocks was known as ""target portfolio weights"".  11The target portfolio weights for each of Orion's investment options were recorded by Orion's portfolio managers in an electronic spreadsheet which was linked to Orion's dealing system.  From the dealing system, the applicant was able to see the difference between the target quantity (based upon the target portfolio weights) and the actual quantity of shares held on behalf of Orion's clients.  12The applicant accessed Orion's dealing system throughout his working day.  This enabled him to carry out his role as an equities dealer.  From time to time, he was also provided with verbal instructions from the portfolio managers with regard to the manner in which particular shares should be bought or sold.  This access and these instructions meant that the applicant was privy to information that enabled him to observe and generally effect:  (a) the time at which shares were bought or sold;  (b) the price at which shares were bought or sold;  (c) the quantity of shares bought or sold; and  (d) the stockbrokers to be used to buy or sell shares.  13It was often the case that the portfolio targets involved the buying or selling of significant volumes of a particular stock.  In the course of buying or selling in significant volumes, the applicant came to appreciate that large volume trading could potentially have the effect of lowering or raising the price of the stock within a short time frame.  14Early in his employment career, in August 2006, the applicant had opened for his own benefit an IG Markets Ltd (IG Markets) trading account.  IG Markets is part of the IG Group based in the United Kingdom.  Its clients include brokers, fund managers and private investors such as the applicant.  15The insider trading offences arose out of conduct by the applicant in which he used financial products offered by IG Markets in the forms of CFDs.  A CFD is a derivative, the value of which is determined by the price of an underlying share.  CFDs on individual shares are different to buying or selling the underlying shares in a number of respects.  First, the CFD trader only has to pay a margin, usually about 10% of the total contract value, rather than having to pay the total transaction amount, as would be required if the underlying shares were bought.  Secondly, unlike a share transaction, when a CFD is sold (""taking a short position"") there is no need for a CFD trader to later acquire the underlying shares for transfer upon settlement.  Thirdly, interest is calculated daily on a CFD trader's overnight position.  Once a CFD position is open, it can generally be held open for as long as a CFD trader wishes.  CFD trading is generally regarded as highly risky.  While there is a greater potential to maximise returns, there is equally a greater potential to suffer large losses in a short time period.  16The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) in its Report 205 at July 2010 describes CFDs in these terms:  CFDs are a highly geared derivative product that allows traders to take a position on the change in the asset of an underlying asset or security...CFDs allow traders to take a short or long position on changes in the value of underlying assets through entering into a swap-style arrangement with the CFD issuer.  A trader entering into a long position (buying a CFD), for example, is betting that the price of the underlying share will move higher relative to today's price.  In contrast, a trader taking a short position (selling a CFD) is betting that the price will move below today's price.  In an associated document in evidence before the Sentencing Judge (ASIC Financial Tips and Safety Checks, Exhibit 3) the following warning was given:  Essentially, under a CFD you are borrowing money to bet on the short term movement of share prices.  If you are right you make money.  If you're wrong you lose...CFDs are generally highly geared products.  This means your stake will generally only be a fraction of the market value of the shares you're contracting for...You're effectively gambling a much larger amount of money than if you went to the casino or racetrack.  You therefore face potentially unlimited losses.  17Initially, the applicant used his trading account with IG Markets for personal trading.  This trading did not involve the use of inside information.  Overall, it seems he lost money in relation to this early period of trading and his account was suspended for a time.  From about mid 2008, the applicant re-commenced trading in CFDs after he had reopened his IG Markets accounts.  These later trades were made based on the information the applicant received about trades Orion intended to make in the same stock.  As he said in his statement to ASIC (Exhibit A, para 20):  If I saw that Orion needed to trade in a stock and that may have a material impact on the price of the stock, then I would trade for myself personally and then trade out of the position when I thought it was appropriate for my personal best interests.  In the same statement, the applicant indicated that his ability to trade using the insider information was constrained initially because of his financial position.  Over time, however, the size of the trades he could make on his IG Markets accounts grew quite significantly.  It appeared the account was in his own name and when it was initially opened, it was done so by use of an Orion letterhead document.  There was no suggestion that a false name or false address or anything of that kind had been used.  18It is necessary to backtrack to deal with the offences relating to the communications given to Mr Curtis.  Mr Curtis was a childhood friend of the applicant.  Inside information was communicated by the applicant to Mr Curtis during the period May 2007 to mid June 2008.  Discussions between the two young men lead to a mutual understanding that Mr Curtis would trade in CFDs using inside information communicated to him by the applicant.  Mr Curtis would provide the capital and the applicant would provide the information.  This information, once again, related to Orion's intended trading in the shares and entities listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.  19Mr Curtis purchased two Blackberry phones and these were used in their communications with one another.  It was Mr Curtis' idea that communications should take place in this manner because the consequence would be that data would not be left on telecommunication services.  It appears that it was agreed between the applicant and Mr Curtis that this system of messaging would also coordinate the taking up of a CFD position by Mr Curtis before the applicant commenced his trading in the shares of the same entity.  This was done to maximise the likelihood that the share price would move in the same direction as the CFD taken out by Mr Curtis.  The proposal involved, after the distribution of brokerage and other expenses, a sharing of profits.  20The applicant stopped passing on information to Mr Curtis in about June 2008.  By this stage, his financial circumstances had changed and he decided he would use the Orion trading information himself using his IG Markets account.  He told Mr Curtis ""I just can't keep on giving you this information"".  21In his statement to ASIC, the applicant said that when he started work at Orion, he had signed a personal trading policy document.  This instructed him in relation to the insider trading laws and warned him against conflicts of interests that might arise between Orion, Orion's clients and his personal trading activities.  His supervisor Tim Ryan told him that Orion strongly discouraged personal trading.  The policy made it clear that he was required to notify Orion and obtain permission from his supervisor in relation to any personal transactions.  In that situation, he was required to fill out a form and disclose the identity of his broker, how many shares he had bought and the price.  22During his employment, the applicant was required on some three occasions to complete an audit form.  This required him to state whether or not he had engaged in any trading during the relevant period.  On each of these occasions, the applicant responded to the audit by stating that he had not been involved in trading.  This was an untrue statement.  23In evidence before the sentencing judge was a statement of Robert MacAlpine.  He was a solicitor with ASIC.  By August 2008, ASIC had become aware of concerns in relation to personal trading by the applicant.  By late October 2008, ASIC had become aware of the trades conducted on the trading account held by the applicant with IG markets for the period between 1 October 2007 and 31 July 2008.  This trading included four trades which eventually were represented by Counts 1 to 4 in the indictment.  24By 8 January 2009, ASIC had become aware of trades on the account for the entire period from August 2008 to January 2009.  ASIC was in the process of assessing this information relating to the overall trading of the applicant when events suddenly came to a head in mid January 2009.  25The applicant received a request from IG Markets that he provide trade approval from Orion for the trades that he had done on the IG Markets account for the previous year.  Written approval to this effect was required to be produced within one week, failing which, it was stated, IG Markets would present the matter to the applicant's employer.  Clearly, there was no way out for the applicant and in a state of desperation he approached his father, Dr Keith Hartman, and told him everything that he had done.  26The applicant's father immediately arranged an appointment for the applicant to see a solicitor, Mr Mark O'Brien and instructions were given, first, to inform Orion what had happened and secondly to make arrangements for the applicant to see ASIC with a view to making full admissions immediately.  27The applicant wrote a meaningful letter of apology to his co-workers and employers at Orion and was notified in turn on the 20 January 2009 that his employment had been terminated.  In the letter, Orion stated that it would disclose the applicant's conduct to ASIC immediately.  28The applicant's voluntary recorded interview with ASIC took place on 21 January 2009.  In this interview, the applicant made substantial admissions as to conduct he had engaged in while an employee of Orion.  The admissions concerned:  (a) trading in CFDs that he had conducted on his account on IG markets; and  (b) his communication of confidential price sensitive Orion trading information to Mr Curtis.  29In addition, the applicant also provided further information in the interview regarding other third party conduct not involving any transgression or misconduct on the applicant's part.  30Following the completion of the interview, and no doubt because of it, ASIC commenced its formal investigation under s 13 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) in respect to contraventions, both by the applicant and Mr Curtis and associated entities, of offences under the Corporations Act 2001 .  31On 22 July 2009, IG Markets commenced interpleader proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria in relation to the credit balance of the applicant's trading account.  Later the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) applied for orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in relation to the credit balance of the account, being the sum of $1,592,499.93.  With the co-operation of the applicant, these proceedings were resolved by consent.  The ultimate consent orders effectively dealt with the property in dispute in the interpleader proceedings.  32By September 2009, ASIC and the applicant's legal representatives were in discussion regarding the possibility of the applicant cooperating to resolve criminal and other actions against him.  In September and October 2009, there were further interviews by ASIC with the applicant.  The subject matter of these interviews extended to a range of matters in which no allegation of impropriety was made against the applicant.  33On 24 February 2010, the applicant provided ASIC with a signed statement in which he admitted the truth of all the facts and conclusions asserted against him.  He also indicated his intention to plead guilty to the 25 offences set out in the annexed document.  Finally, the applicant provided ASIC with an undertaking to cooperate for the purposes of s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and two forms for the purposes of s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914.  34On 8 March 2010, the applicant was issued with Court Attendance Notices in which he was charged with 25 offences in substantially the same form as those contained in the indictment presented before the Supreme Court.  On 6 April 2010, the applicant appeared before the Downing Centre Local Court and entered a plea of guilty to the 25 charges in the Court Attendance Notices.  On 6 August 2010, the applicant was arraigned before the Supreme Court of New South Wales.  He entered a plea of guilty to each of the charges contained in the indictment.  In addition he asked for the offences listed on the Section 16BA forms to be taken into account as a part of the sentencing process.  The Applicant's Subjective Case - Material before the Sentencing Judge  35The applicant presented a substantial subjective case at the sentencing hearing.  For example, there was evidence to demonstrate that the applicant was fully willing to facilitate the course of justice.  This was evidenced by his prompt attendance at ASIC on the 21 September 2009 and his voluntary admissions made during the first interview.  It was evidenced thereafter by his facilitation of the making of the order under the Proceeds of Crime Act .  It was also evidenced by his entry of a plea at the earliest available opportunity.  His co-operation with authorities and the provision of assistance, both past and present, was also significant.  36One factor of special importance in the sentencing proceedings was the material relating to the applicant's mental illness.  This, of course, had a bearing not only on the subjective case presented on his behalf but also on the issue of the overall criminality involved in the commission of the offences.  37The evidence before the Sentencing Judge included various reports of the applicant's treating psychiatrist, Dr Wilson, and the report of the consultant psychiatrist, Professor Jonathon Phillips.  38Dr Wilson had treated the applicant since the time of his admission to the North Side Clinic in January 2009.  He had been admitted in a distressed and suicidal state.  Dr Wilson had diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a major depressive disorder with anxiety, pathological gambling and past (chronic) dysthymia.  Dr Wilson stated in his report on 7 November 2009:  There was initial consideration given to the diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood, but his syndrome was much more severe, pervasive and persistent than an adjustment disorder.  The pre-existing dysthymia and strong family history further contributed to the diagnosis of major depressive order.  39In relation to the gambling addiction, referred to in his reports, Dr Wilson said:  Mr Hartman meets diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling.  This includes preoccupation with gambling, a need to gamble increasing amounts of money, plus feeling gambling is pointless if you cannot gamble large amounts.  He gambles to relieve dysphoria and as a way of achieving a sense of escape...as mentioned, some of Mr Hartman's stock market activity appears to constitute gambling behaviour also.  Dr Wilson developed this at page 3 of his report when he said:  There are elements of Mr Hartman's approach to his work in share trading that are closely akin to gambling.  Mr Hartman describes a similar ""rush"" and excitement with share trading to gambling.  The share trading also has a compulsive quality and often interferes with normal social and home function.  A striking example is that Mr Hartman would wake through the night and check the price of various shares.  He had his bedroom set up so that he faced the computer screen.  Because he could not view the screen from the lying position, he kept binoculars with him, and viewed the screen through these throughout the night.  40It appears that shortly prior to the sentencing hearing, the applicant suffered a brief relapse in relation to his gambling addiction.  He had been free from gambling activities for quite a considerable time prior to this relapse.  Dr Wilson had attempted to pre-empt this in his earlier work with the applicant.  In his September 2010 report he said:  In the light of our work and various discussions, John and I together formulated his difficulties as involving a combination of factors such as being heavily prone to addiction, being inexperienced and foolish with regard to judgment as well as suffering significant depression and trying in a sense to self medicate by way of gambling which included his illegal activities.  41The reasons for the applicant's depressive condition were not in issue.  It appears to have been generally accepted at the sentence hearing that the applicant's serious depressive problems began when he was in his last year at school.  Prior to this time, he had been a relatively happy boy, successful in many areas of his schooling and popular with his many friends.  There was however, as Dr Phillips in his reports noted, a strong family history of psychiatric disorder.  Up until his final year at school, the applicant had recorded a generally happy family life but his situation changed dramatically when his brother Alex was diagnosed with serious bi-polar disorder at the age of eighteen.  Alex made a suicide attempt at the time.  He was treated by psychiatrists and found to be medication resistant.  There were involuntary admissions to hospital.  These events, according to the applicant's father and teachers, had a significant effect on him and led to serious changes in his personality and behaviour.  42In his September 2010 report, Dr Phillips expressed the opinion that the applicant suffered chronic depression spectrum symptoms and that these, according to reliable material, had been in existence at the time of the commission of the offences.  Dr Phillips thought it probable that the applicant had sought temporary relief from his dysphoric state through his illegal activities.  He explained that relief, at least in part, was achieved through his personal trading activities and through gambling.  However, he did not believe that the applicant had a personality disorder in those regards.  He concluded in this report:  Mr Hartman has a clear understanding of his wrongdoing.  He does not deny his illegal actions.  He recognises that he will be punished for his illegal actions and is trying to make adjustment to this.  He is ashamed by his illegal actions and is contrite.  He is not psychopathic by disposition.  He committed his illegal actions at a time when his thinking was altered because of his chronic depression symptoms with motivation at the time principally to lift himself (albeit in a temporary matter) above his anhedonic symptoms.  He remains in therapy with Dr Wilson and has reached a point in the process of treatment where it is highly unlikely that he will offend again.  43We turn next to consider a third factor that was of importance in the sentencing hearing.  44The material before the Sentencing Judge relating to the applicant's provision of assistance to the authorities and cooperation with them was beyond doubt compelling.  Indeed, at the hearing, the experienced Crown Prosecutor informed the Sentencing Judge that the assistance he had provided was ""substantial"" and ""significant"".  The learned Crown Prosecutor added (Transcript 101):  What happened as well was that not only was there a plea, but there was, I am instructed, a disclosure of his own activity as regards a number of activities that he had been involved in.  It does not happen often in cases such as this...the number of cases that people expose, frankly, the whole of their activity is unusual and it is sought to be encouraged by the investigator involving these matters and sought to be encouraged by the only way that is possible by your Honour dealing with it here.  Mr MacAlpine in his statement said (Appeal Book 240-241):  [42] The offender's assistance to ASIC commenced with his participation in an interview on 21 January 2010.  [43] The offender's participation in the interview provided ASIC with assistance in a number of ways:  (a) he identified and explained conduct that he had engaged in;  (b) he identified and explained conduct that he alleged Mr Curtis had engaged in;  (c) he identified sources of evidence for ASIC to pursue in an investigation of possible offences;  (d) his admissions were made voluntarily under caution with consequent evidential and not merely informational value; and  (e) savings in ASIC's time and resources flowing from the assistance referred to in (a)-(d).  [44] I believe that the offender was candid and truthful in interview.  45Mr MacAlpine made it clear that, in the absence of information being disclosed by the applicant, ASIC would not have identified the tipping offences nor would they have been likely to have obtained material that assisted them in the investigation as to whether Mr Curtis had himself engaged in insider trading.  He fairly stated that without the assistance of the applicant, there would not have been sufficient admissible evidence to prove the tipping offences to the required standard in a defended prosecution.  46In relation to the final statement made by the applicant in February 2010, Mr MacAlpine said that the provision of this statement enabled the charging and prosecution of the applicant to be commenced earlier than it could otherwise have been.  It saved ASIC from deploying resources to obtain most of the witness statements that would have been needed for a full brief of evidence against the applicant.  Mr MacAlpine also made reference to the manner in which the applicant had given an undertaking to assist and give evidence in any proceedings against Mr Curtis.  Although no decision had been made as to whether any charges would be brought against Mr Curtis, it was stated that the applicant would be a crucial witness in any future criminal or civil proceedings against Mr Curtis.  He reiterated that the applicant had also provided information and assistance in relation to further matters in which it was not alleged the applicant had any involvement.  This assistance was also provided on a voluntary basis.  47In the concluding portion of his statement, Mr MacAlpine said:  [68] Since participating in the interview on 21 January 2009, the offender has at all times assisted ASIC in a timely and effective manner.  [69] I consider that the offender has made a genuine effort to fully cooperate with ASIC's investigators and lawyers and to be full and frank in each interview he has attended.  [70] The offender's disclosure of information to ASIC has included voluntary admissions as to his own involvement in conduct contravening the Corporations Act 2001.  These included admissions by the offender that he communicated inside information to Mr Curtis which ASIC would have otherwise been unlikely to identify or be able to prove by admissible evidence to a required standard.  ...  [75] It is inherently difficult to obtain the evidence necessary to prove insider trading offences and for this reason it is of significant assistance to ASIC if persons voluntarily disclose details of their own conduct or the conduct of others.  48Mr Hartman gave evidence at the sentence hearing before the Sentencing Judge and submitted himself for cross-examination.  In his evidence in chief, he confirmed the facts to which earlier reference had been made . He gave evidence that he had paid tax on the profits he made from the illegal trades and that he had openly conducted the IG Markets account in his own name.  However, he agreed that he had lied in relation to the audit statements made to his employer as to whether he had been trading during the relevant period.  At Appeal Book 69 the following passage occurs in his evidence in chief:  Question: Alright.  Now in terms of how you, shall I say, felt when you made CFD trades, in your own words, what were your feelings, shall I say, when you made these trades?  Answer: The way that I was feeling around the time, I was in a very depressed state and the CFD trading gave a feeling similar to that of gambling.  Question: And was that a good feeling?  Answer: It was a rush of adrenalin similar to gambling.  Question: Alright and did you make both big losses and big gains?  Answer: Yes.  Question: Sometimes after many hundreds of thousands of dollars at once?  Answer: Yes.  The applicant, in evidence, revealed a somewhat contrasting aspect of his life that ran counter to his illegal behaviour.  During the time when it was occurring, he was working as a volunteer doing community work at Theresa House which is a shelter for homeless men.  He would do this once or twice a month and the work required him to stay overnight, sleeping in a terrace in Redfern that provided emergency accommodation for twelve homeless people.  The work was done by himself and another volunteer over a period of years.  Secondly, he revealed that after he had lost his position with Orion and following his treatment at Northside Clinic, he had received the assistance and guidance of a Jesuit priest, Father Steve Sinn who was the parish priest at St Canices at Elizabeth Bay.  In effect, following this, the applicant became the priest's personal assistant helping him especially with the parish work involving the care of homeless people and disadvantaged refugees in the local community.  He worked in this capacity as a volunteer, wage-free for nearly two years.  Father Sinn, as did others, provided a powerful reference at the sentencing hearing.  49The pre-sentence report prepared in June 2010 generally corroborated all the matters to which we have made reference.  The Probation and Parole officer in charge, Ms Gloria Enfield, said in relation to the mental health issue:  It appears that Mr Hartman first experienced feelings of depression during his later years of high school which corresponded with the time [when] one [of] his brothers became seriously unwell with a psychiatric illness, which was later diagnosed as bi-polar disorder.  His depression remained untreated for several years, however after his illegal behaviour became known, Mr Hartman began treatment with a psychiatrist, initially twice weekly.  In the past he has experienced feelings of suicidal ideation and he had begun to plan how he would suicide, although at the time of his interview with this service, he indicated he was no longer feeling suicidal...In January 2009 Mr Hartman was admitted to a residential psychiatric unit, where he stayed for three weeks while treatment was commenced.  He has been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and anxiety and remains on medication for these, as well as engaging in regular counselling.  In the concluding part of the report, Ms Enfield said:  Presenting as a cooperative albeit anxious person, Mr Hartman appears to have the benefit of stable formative years, raised by parents who remain emotionally supportive of him, despite their bewilderment of their son's offending behaviour.  Inquires indicate that Mr Hartman began to experience depression when he was about sixteen years old, at about the time one his brothers developed a serious psychiatric illness.  In his late teens, Mr Hartman developed a gambling dependency which in part has been a means, however dysfunctional, of his attempting to deal with his feelings of depression.  His psychiatrist also believes his gambling dependence may have played a role in his cognitions in the workplace...He appears to have developed significant insight into what influenced his illegal behaviour and it is encouraging that he appears committed to maintaining the constructive changes he has brought to his life.  The emotional support Mr Hartman receives from his family is also a positive element in his life.  The Sentencing Judge's Remarks  50The Sentencing Judge gave careful consideration to the situation of the offender.  He was satisfied that the offences were serious, particularly as they had been carried over a period of about nineteen months.  His Honour said (para 45 ROS):  It must be remembered that his crimes were not victimless.  Each illegal transaction was likely to have a cost to someone who either traded or held their position without the benefit of the knowledge available to the offender.  The offender set about systematically trading in breach of the law for the sole purpose of enhancing his personal wealth at the expense of others.  The evidence which I accept indicates that the insider trading charges alone made him a total profit in excess of $1.9 million.  [46] The Courts have said on many occasions that general deterrence is of particular significance in relation to white-collar crime.  This is particularly the case in relation to insider trading offences which by their nature are easy to perpetrate but difficult to identify.  Whereas in the present case the course of offending conduct results in the commission of multiple offences, a sentence of imprisonment is inevitable.  I appreciate that the trades which the offender was making were not made in conventional markets but I do not accept that as a consequence the need for general deterrence is diminished.  [47] Although the offender has suffered from psychiatric difficulties, the need for a sentence which reflects general deterrence is such that his psychiatric illness is of only limited significance in the present case.  There can be no doubt that notwithstanding any illness he may have been suffering from, he knew that what he was doing was wrong and a breach of the law.  It appears that the Sentencing Judge accepted that the offender had been suffering from a psychiatric illness as the medical reports had indicated, and that it was related to the gambling and illegal trading.  His Honour said (para 37 ROS):  It would seem that the thrill of his illegal trades was similar to the thrill he received from a gamble on a horse or a play at the casino.  His need for a ""thrill"" may be related to his psychiatric problems to which I have referred again below.  In part his behaviour may be explained by those problems but it cannot be excused.  51The Sentencing Judge acknowledged the contrition expressed by the applicant for his offending and for the hurt he had caused his family and others.  His Honour acknowledged the assistance given to ASIC and indicated that he would give a discount of the type discussed in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603.  He determined the appropriate discount in that regard to be 10 per cent.  He also noted that the applicant was prepared to give evidence against another person and thereby was entitled to a further discount in that regard.  This discount was determined to be 10 per cent in relation to the sentence for the tipping offences to which his offer to give evidence related.  His Honour also accepted that the applicant was entitled to the maximum discount of 25 per cent for his plea of guilty in that he had thereby demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  52The Sentencing Judge was rather more guarded in relation to the prospects of rehabilitation.  This was because of the gambling relapse a short time before the sentencing hearing.  Had it not been for that situation, it appears that his Honour would have accepted that the applicant was fully rehabilitated.  However, his Honour noted that it would be unlikely that the applicant would ever again secure employment in a position where he would be able to trade with inside information in the financial markets.  53Generally, his Honour was critical of that segment of the business world that allowed a person of the applicant's youth and immaturity to be beguiled by the enormous salaries and rewards that were given to him for what was, as his Honour described it, a ""responsible clerical position"".  His Honour adopted Dr Hartman's description of the world in which his son was employed as ""plastic"".  This, according to his Honour, was a world, which, while the applicant was still at university, corrupted his values and resulted in him pursuing ""the high life"" without regard for whether or not he was committing criminal offences.  His Honour was also critical of the lack of effective supervision provided to the applicant.  He said:  The temptations are so great and the potential rewards so significant that the fall into criminality of individuals is a significant risk.  54The Sentencing Judge took into account the applicant's good character and the fact that he had never come under adverse notice prior to these offences.  55His Honour then imposed the sentences to which we have made reference at the commencement of these reasons.  It is clear from his Honour's remarks that his Honour accepted the submissions of the Crown and Mr Game SC that the structure of the sentences should be determined by grouping the two sets of offences and providing concurrency within each group but allowing for accumulation as between them.  His Honour said (57-59 ROS):  [57] The sentences I propose compared with the extensive criminality of the offender may, to some people, seem to be lenient.  This is in large part due to the Crown's concession that I should consider the offences as two sets of offences reflecting the two statutory provisions which were breached and assume a total maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment, being five years for each set.  [58] Furthermore, although the offender must be adequately punished and others deterred, I am mindful of his relative youth, psychiatric illness and the possibility, notwithstanding my reservations, of his future rehabilitation.  [59] In all the circumstances I have decided that the sentence which I impose for the insider trading offences should be discounted by a total of 25%, the discount for the tipping offences will be 45%.  The latter includes a discount of 10% conditional upon the offender giving evidence in the contemplated proceedings against the alleged co-offender and also includes the Ellis discount.  Commentary on the Sentences  56As can be seen, count 1 attracted a sentence of three years.  Counts 2-19 attracted a sentence of two years each with all sentences to commence on 2 December 2010.  Thus, but for the discount of 25 per cent, these sentences would have been four years and two years eight months respectively.  57The Sentencing Judge applied a discount of 45 per cent for the tipping offences which reflected a 25 per cent discount for the plea at the earliest opportunity, the 10 per cent portion of the discount depended upon the applicant giving evidence in accordance with his undertaking in other proceedings and a further discount was given of 10 per cent, being the "" Ellis "" discount.  58On count 20 the applicant received a sentence of two years and on counts 21-25 he received a sentence of 18 months each, with all to be wholly concurrent.  Thus, but for the 45 per cent discount, these sentences would have been just over three years and seven months, and just over two years and eight months respectively.  59The ratio between the non-parole period fixed by his Honour and the overall sentence was 66 per cent.  Neither party has suggested any error on his Honour's part in the fixing of the non-parole period (see Hili v R (2010) 85 ALJR 196 which rejected the application of any ""norm"" involving an accepted ratio of 60-66 per cent between the overall sentence and non-parole period for federal offences).  Resolution of the Appeal  60In relation to grounds 1 and 2, the complaint is made first that no discount was applied to the insider trading sentences to reflect any aspect of the applicant's past assistance to authorities.  Secondly, it is said that the composite discount applied to the tipping sentences did not expressly include a discount for past assistance given by the applicant in relation to those offences.  61In its written submissions, and orally before this Court, the Crown, through Mr Beech-Jones SC, conceded that the sentencing Judge had fallen into error in relation to each of these matters.  Secondly, although the Crown submitted that the Court might redress the error by simply readjusting the relevant discounts, it was accepted that, as a matter of principle, this Court was bound to re-sentence the applicant and, in so doing, was entitled, if thought appropriate, to approach the re-sentencing exercise from a broad perspective.  Given the complexity of the matters involved, we determine that we should approach the imposition of sentence as a full re-exercise of the sentencing discretion.  Additional material available on the re-sentencing exercise  62A considerable body of evidence has been placed before the Court for its use in re-sentencing the applicant.  We shall briefly identify this material.  63First, there is Exhibit A, an affidavit from Robert MacAlpine, the senior lawyer in one of ASIC's market integrity deterrence teams.  This affidavit provides detail of the assistance that has been given by the applicant to ASIC since the time of his sentence.  For obvious reasons, we do not propose in this decision to detail the assistance which has been provided.  It is sufficient to say that it has been significant in terms of both time and output.  Whether any other person will be prosecuted in relation to the material provided by the applicant has not yet been decided by ASIC.  The applicant remains bound by his undertaking to provide assistance in any future criminal or civil proceedings instituted against Mr Curtis for offences of contravening the Corporations Act 2001 .  Mr MacAlpine states:  I consider that the applicant has made a genuine effort to fully co-operate with ASIC's investigators and lawyers whenever he has been asked for assistance or information.  64Exhibit B is an affidavit by the applicant sworn 8 October 2011.  It details his progress in prison.  He has made good use of his time completing a real-estate course with TAFE and is presently engaged in a building and construction course with the same educational institution.  The applicant has also participated in a prison based addiction program.  Although this did not relate to gambling addiction, the applicant has endeavoured to use the program to his advantage, having regard to his own particular problem.  There are other courses that he has completed whilst in custody.  65The applicant states that he currently holds the position of head library clerk.  This gives him a fairly high degree of responsibility in the prison.  His role includes maintaining the library, processing book loans and helping inmates to access library services.  He also helps inmates, particularly those of a foreign background or those with poor English skills to understand and type legal documents such as immigration applications.  It appears to be accepted that he has been well behaved in custody and there have been no adverse findings against him.  66The applicant is currently housed in a facility which accommodates inmates in protective custody.  Regrettably, the applicant's own situation in relation to receiving adequate treatment of a psychiatric nature while in custody is disappointing.  He has, despite his efforts, been able to see a psychologist on one occasion only.  It took three months to organise and the consultation lasted for about 5 minutes.  There does not appear to be any opportunity for regular consultation with a psychiatrist or psychologist in the applicant's present circumstances.  The applicant would like (and needs in the interest of rehabilitation) to receive some assistance in custody in relation to therapy or participation in programs that would help him overcome his gambling addiction but regrettably these do not appear to be available.  67The applicant expresses very clearly his remorse in relation to the offences.  He also presents a clear understanding of the circumstances which have led to the unfortunate situation in which he now finds himself.  Finally, we should mention o element of concern in the affidavit.  This relates to the abuse and threats he has received because it is known that he is giving some assistance to the authorities.  He has not been, to this point, physically assaulted but has been verbally abused on a number of occasions for assisting authorities in relation to a former friend.  He has received several threats of violence.  68Exhibit C is material collated by the applicant's solicitor Mark O'Brien.  It includes evidence to support the applicant's success in the courses he has been doing through TAFE.  Secondly, there is a further reference from Father Sinn.  He has visited the applicant in prison on three or four occasions.  The letter is very persuasive on the issue of rehabilitation.  Father Sinn says:  No one wants to be in prison.  Having said that, John has made the best of the circumstances.  ...John has learnt so much during his time at [prison]; he does not take for granted the love of his family or friends; he has come to understand himself more deeply and to be in touch with his true self, his humanity.  It may seem obvious, but out there in the commercial world the humanity of young people is not nurtured.  He is aware as never before that he is prone to depression and that gambling is no way to medicate.  He is aware of the importance of relationships in his life.  This growth and awareness is the foundation that he is building his life on and has given him peace with himself.  I look forward to seeing him soon and being part of his life in the years to come.  69A further annexure is an updated report from Professor Jonathon Phillips.  This report essentially summarises all of the psychiatric evidence at the sentencing proceedings and addresses the issue of the relationship between the applicant's psychiatric condition and the commission of the offences which have seen him incarcerated.  These matters were, of course, raised before the sentencing Judge, but for more abundant caution, Professor Phillips has re-addressed them.  It will be sufficient to note paragraph 50 of the report:  With respect, and as stated in my first report, I believe it is critical in Mr Hartman's case to note that his criminal behaviour occurred at a time of mental disturbance.  The pattern is simple.  Mr Hartman had a major depressive disorder of several years duration at the time.  He attempted to escape chronic anhedonic feelings by seeking a ""rush"".  He did this through hazardous drinking, the use of elicit psycho-active drugs, gambling and illegal trading.  The aim was identical across the activities, simply to achieve a ""rush"".  Seeking the ""rush"" became a compulsive behaviour over which he had very little control.  70The final affidavit (Exhibit D) annexed a report from Dr Craig Wilson.  He had visited the applicant in prison on 3 November 2011.  This report sought to provide a current assessment for the applicant's condition.  71There are really two strands to Dr Wilson's observations.  First, he expressed disappointment that the applicant had not been able to obtain the type of psychiatric treatment and assistance he had hoped would be available to the applicant in custody.  He expressed the opinion that it was ""very disappointing"" that someone who had had such severe mental illness difficulties in the past has not had any appropriate psychiatric review.  Similarly, he was ""disappointed"" that the prison did not provide any specialised program for people suffering from a gambling addiction.  In addition, he noted there had been no psychological intervention to assess, address or explore relapse prevention with regard to the applicant's depressive illness.  72On a more hopeful note, Dr Wilson was pleased with the applicant's present mental state.  He noted that there had been no serious resurgence of his depressive symptoms and particularly no aspect of suicidality.  His observations were that the applicant was physically well and that mentally he was making the best of his situation in custody.  He thought that there was a very low risk of any re-offending.  In his report he said:  Since the day he made his confession to ASIC, Mr Hartman has gradually regained his previous closeness to his family, has reconnected with his values of integrity and hard work, and reaserted the value of community service in his life.  Through his help seeking behaviour he has gained greater insight into his susceptibility to depressive illness and his lifelong vulnerability to gambling addiction in its varied forms.  73In relation to the link between the applicant's depression and the offending behaviour, Dr Wilson said:  Addiction illnesses (including gambling addiction) and mood disorders are known to be frequently co-morbid and exacerbate each other's clinical course.  From another perspective, the addictive behaviour of both Mr Hartman's illegal trading activities and his gambling can be viewed as coping strategies to deal with dysphoric feelings and mood states associated with depression.  They are, of course, inadequate coping mechanisms, but the sense of ""rush"" or ""buzz"" that Mr Hartman has described, and problem gamblers in general are known to feel, does serve to compensate for flat, withdrawn and negative feelings of depressive illness.  It provides a brief respite from the dysphoric state, but of course has an addictive and compulsive quality directly akin to substance addiction, and ultimately serves to worsen a depressive condition rather than ameliorate it.  74In summary, Dr Wilson said:  In my opinion as Mr Hartman's treating psychiatrist he is coping reasonably with the difficulties of incarceration.  He is however receiving inadequate care and treatment.  It is unfortunate that sufficient and appropriate treatment modalities are not available or provided to Mr Hartman and I am certain that he would be well engaged with and receiving far superior treatment if not in custody.  Mr Hartman seems generally remorseful and keen to embrace a future congruent with his re-focused core values.  It is my hope that he achieves freedom from custody while he is able to maintain his good spirits and momentum for positive change.  Re-sentencing the applicant  75We turn now to re-sentence the applicant.  76First, we bear in mind (as did the sentencing Judge) that the statutory obligation (s 16A(1) Crimes Act (Cth) ) is to impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.  Secondly, we acknowledge the need to take into account a number of the relevant aspects of s 16A(2) of the Act .  In particular, there is a need in the present re-sentencing exercise to consider the following matters especially:  The applicant's contrition and remorse in relation to his offending;  The applicant's plea of guilty and its circumstances;  His co-operation with authorities ""in the investigation of the offence or other offences"";  His youth, relative immaturity and his psychiatric condition;  The applicant's prospects of rehabilitation;  The need to ensure the applicant is adequately punished for the offence.  77Thirdly, it is necessary to acknowledge that general deterrence, although not listed in s 16A(2), is an important general principle of sentencing and needs to be taken into account ( Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370; 51 A Crim R 123; Lodhi v The Queen [2007] 179 A Crim R 470 at [81] per Spigelman CJ).  Indeed, all of the well known objects established by common law principles apply to the sentencing of a Federal offender: Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ at 622 [15].  78With those matters in mind, we begin with an acceptance of the proposition that the circumstances of the present offence satisfy us that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate.  Of course, the offender has already been in prison for nearly a year.  However, we consider that the sentencing Judge was correct in recognising that a sentence of full time imprisonment was appropriate in the present matter.  This was accepted on the applicant's behalf at the original hearing and there is no dispute with the proposition upon appeal.  79Secondly, we accept the argument of the Crown that the offences in the indictment (and the offences in the table) are serious offences as was the general course of criminal conduct engaged in by the applicant.  With one addition, we respectfully adopt the sentencing Judge's statement at paragraph 44:  The offender engaged continuously in serious criminal conduct over a period of 19 months.  His offences were serious.  His conduct was both in breach of the law and contrary to his obligations to his employer.  He was aware of those obligations which had been communicated to him in writing.  Furthermore he had responded to questions from his employer asking whether he was trading on his own account by lying and falsely stating that he was not trading.  80The addition to which we have made reference arises out of the evidence of Dr Wilson and Professor Jonathan Phillips.  This evidence establishes to our satisfaction that there was a nexus between the applicant's psychiatric condition, his gambling addiction and the commission of these offences, especially the insider trading offences.  We accept that there is a foundation for it in the applicant's evidence (see para 48 above) although we acknowledge, as the Crown submitted, that an important aspect of the applicant's motivation in committing both groups of offences was to make profits for himself.  81In DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 205 A Crim R 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 McClellan CJ at CL helpfully set out at [177] in short form the principles which have been developed and applied in sentencing an offender who was suffering from a mental illness, an intellectual handicap or other mental problem.  Two aspects of the summary are relevant in the present matter and bear repetition:  Â· Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence [authorities omitted].  Â· It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed [authorities omitted].  82The Crown argued that the factual situation in the present matter did not compel this Court to disregard general deterrence.  In that regard, the Crown referred to the observations by Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 where his Honour said:  ... in truth however, for the reasons given at the commencement of this Judgment, the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles.  The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case.  83Gleeson CJ had earlier said, at the commencement of his judgment, (at [69]):  It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in light of the purpose to be served by the sentencing exercise.  84The Crown also made reference to the remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at [52].  In that decision the Chief Judge had discussed the accepted principle of sentencing that general deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality on the basis that such an offender could not to be regarded as an appropriate medium for making an example to others.  At the end of the discussion, his Honour had said:  The means by which the courts give effect to that principle (as an instrument of social administration) is to moderate the consideration of general deterrence to the circumstances of the particular case.  But, if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation need not be great.  85The Crown placed particular emphasis on this last paragraph.  86For our part, we do not consider that the particular paragraph relied on by the Crown in the reasons of Hunt CJ at CL carries with it the notion that, in a situation where an offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and is aware that it is wrong, his mental condition will have no impact on the issue of general deterrence and may accordingly be disregarded.  Nor do we consider that, when read in context, his Honour's remarks suggested that the significance of psychiatric condition in such a case will always be minimal.  87In the earlier part of the discussion Hunt CJ at CL had said:  It is an accepted principle of sentencing that general deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.  In most of the cases in which that principle is applied, the offender has suffered from a significant mental illness or retardation, but such a condition is not a necessary condition for the principle to be applied .  Considerations of general (or even personal) deterrence are not rendered completely irrelevant, and the significance of the offender's mental incapacity is to be weighed and evaluated in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case .  [our emphasis]  88It might be observed in the same case that Gleeson CJ, while in general agreement with Hunt CJ at CL's reasons said :  My views on the significance, for sentencing purposes, of the presence of a psychiatric condition in an offender, are set out in the case of Regina v Engert , and it is not necessary to repeat them.  The particular reason given by Hunt CJ at CL which constitutes the basis of my agreement with the orders he proposes, is that, in the present case, the learned sentencing judge allowed the subjective features of the respondent to outweigh the significance properly to be attached to the extremely serious objective circumstances of the case.  89In Engert , Gleeson CJ had cited with approval the remarks of Badgery-Parker J in R v Letteri (NSW CCA unreported 18 March 1992):  The principle then is clear enough.  It is correctly stated as follows: that whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap.  In an extreme case, the proper application of this principle may produce the result that considerations of general deterrence are totally outweighed by other factors.  In every case it is a matter of balancing the relevant factors in a manner no different from that which is involved in every sentencing exercise.  90Gleeson CJ ""emphasised"" the concluding sentence in this passage.  91Our conclusions on this matter may be shortly stated.  First, there is no doubt that the applicant knew what he was doing and knew that his actions were wrongful.  Secondly, his actions were in part motivated and prompted by a wish to make profits from his own trading and the trade initiated by Mr Curtis.  Thirdly, he was throughout the period suffering from a genuine and long term depression spectrum from which he sought relief in gambling and other dangerous activities.  Fourthly, his psychiatric condition contributed to his compulsive trading activity which, in his perception, gave him temporary but misguided relief from his major depressive symptoms.  This trading activity was in fundamental respects a form of highly leveraged gambling akin to the other types of gambling in which he had engaged.  It led on occasions to significant profits but it also led on other occasions to significant losses.  Accordingly, there was a mixed and highly complex group of motivations for his illegal activity part of which was rightly attributed to his psychiatric condition.  His own evidence before the sentencing Judge establishes the nature of the transient ""buzz"" that his illegal activities gave him.  92It follows, in our opinion, that, while the offences were undoubtedly serious, there must be some moderation given to the aspect of general deterrence because of the applicant's mental condition (s 16A(2)(m) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ).  Moreover, to a limited degree, the applicant's moral culpability is accordingly lessened.  93We do not agree, however, that, in the circumstances of this matter, the applicant's youth and relative immaturity have any role to play in downgrading or lessening the importance of general deterrence.  We recognise that in some cases these factors may be both relevant and important on the issue ( MS2 and Ors v Regina [2005] NSWCCA 397; (2005) 158 A Crim R 93 per Simpson J at [9]; Adams J at [15]-[16]; BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; (2010) 201 A Crim R 379 per Hodgson JA at [3]-[6], but see, Johnson J at [74]-[75]; R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at 458; KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at 577-578).  We do not consider in the present matter that they are relevant and important in that way.  The applicant was operating in the adult sphere of business and commerce in every respect, and of course he was himself an educated and worldly young adult in every sense of the word.  The Court cannot lose sight of the need to deter young adults from taking the significant financial advantages offered by the contemporary business world in circumstances where, at the same time, they reject the legal and moral constraints properly imposed upon their commercial behaviour.  94Mr Game also argued that the applicant's choice of trading, namely, off-market highly geared derivatives, might be viewed as less culpable than if he had been trading in the underlying shares.  We are unable to accept this argument. It needs to be remembered that insider trading not only has the capacity to undermine the integrity of the market, it also has the potential to undermine aspects of confidence in the commercial world generally.  The principles of confidentiality and trust are fundamental to the operation of many commercial transactions.  As the applicant's employer recognised, advance knowledge by its employees of proposed trades of a significant kind required, as a matter of trust, that they remain in the realm of confidentiality.  Insider trading is a form of cheating.  Put bluntly, it is a form of fraud, even though its consequences may be more opaque than general fraud ( McQuoid [2010] 1 Cr App R (S) 43; R v Rollins [2011] EWCA Crim 1825).  95We do not consider that the applicant is entitled to an Ellis discount in relation to the insider trading charges although we acknowledge that we should take into account, as part of his assistance and co-operation with the authorities, the fact that he voluntarily attended ASIC and made full admissions before any formal investigation commenced into those matters.  96The assistance and co-operation provided by the applicant to ASIC was and is considerable in the present matter.  We take this into account as required by s 16A(2)(h) of the Act and we do so in our recognition of the difficulties involved in investigating, prosecuting and proving insider trading offences.  97We also take into account and recognise the contrition expressed in practical terms by the applicant since January 2009 and his continuing expressions of remorse.  While recognising the difficulties he will have upon release from custody in relation to combating his gambling addiction, we consider overall that his prospects of rehabilitation are good.  He will have the support of his partner, his family, Father Sinn and others who care for him and these will be important factors in his rehabilitation.  98It is desirable, in the circumstances of the present matter, that we specify a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty.  In relation to the applicants undertaking to co-operate and provide for future assistance to the authorities, it is necessary for us to specify a discount.  There is no reason to depart from the discount of 10% arrived at by the sentencing Judge in his decision and accordingly we ascribe that percentage for future assistance.  99We have taken into account, as we have said, the high degree of the applicant's co-operation and assistance given to date in relation to both groups of offence.  We have also taken into account the past assistance given in relation to the investigation by ASIC into possible offences committed by another person.  In relation to the tipping offences, a further measure of leniency is extended to the applicant for the Ellis factor but, as with the other matters we have mentioned in this paragraph, there is no need for us to quantify this aspect.  Given the multiplicity of the charges and the fact that, if the appropriate discounts were accumulatively applied without qualification, the resulting sentences would be manifestly too lenient so that further adjustment of the sentences would be necessary, we do not think that it would be useful to quantify the discount ultimately provided more than to indicate that it is substantial.  It should also be noted that, having regard to the number of distinct offences committed and the lengthy period they covered the degree of concurrency we provide also extends a further degree of leniency.  100What then is the appropriate sentence to be imposed?  We agree with the sentencing Judge that the 16BA Schedule offences in relation to the insider trader offences should be considered in relation to count 1.  In the same way, the tipping offences in the Schedule should be considered in relation to count 20.  In our view, having regard to all the matters we have considered, and taking into account all the factors we have mentioned, an appropriate sentence in relation to count 1 is a term of 2 1/2 years imprisonment commencing on 2 December 2010 and expiring on 1 June 2013.  In relation to counts 2-19 we consider that the appropriate sentence is a term of 2 years imprisonment each term to commence on 2 December 2010 and to expire on 1 December 2012.  101In relation to the first tipping offence (count 20), and having regard to the Schedule offences in respect of that count, an appropriate sentence is a term of 18 months imprisonment to commence on 2 June 2012 and expiring on 1 December 2013.  102In relation to counts 21-25 we consider an appropriate term of sentence for each count is 16 months each term to commence on 2 June 2012 and expiring on 1 October 2013.  103As a consequence, the overall term of the sentence will be 3 years.  The terms of s 19AC of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) require that we make a recognisance release order in those circumstances.  This section allows for conditional release of an offender after conviction.  Section 19AB of the Act requires that we direct, by order, that the applicant be released after he has served a specified period of imprisonment in respect of the offences.  The terms of the recognisance for the purposes of the release will require the applicant to comply with conditions set by the Court.  There has been, we have been informed, considerable discussion between the Crown and the appellant's legal representatives in that regard.  There has been liaison in relation to appropriate terms with the probation and parole service.  As a consequence, while the Crown is not conceding that such an order should be made, the Court has been provided with a document containing 14 draft conditions of an order that is generally thought appropriate as between the parties and the probation and parole service.  104In arriving at an appropriate pre-release period of imprisonment in the present matter, we particularly take into account two matters:  first, the highly favourable material provided for the purposes of the re-sentencing exercise and secondly, the stringent nature of the conditions provided for in the document we have referred to in the preceding paragraph.  As to the first, we stress the applicant's rehabilitation in custody, his continued remorse and his level of continuing assistance to the authorities.  As to the second, we note that the conditions are aimed at preventing the applicant's relapse into criminal behaviour but, more significantly, they provide a regime of treatment which, it appears, is not available to him in custody and which will, in the nature of things, promote and enhance his re-entry into the wider community.  In the exceptional circumstances of this matter, and for all the reasons outlined in this decision, the pre-release period we have selected is 15 months.  105We propose to specify a single pre-release period of imprisonment of 15 months to commence on 2 December 2010 and to expire on `1 March 2012.  This means that we shall order the release of the applicant to take effect on 1 March 2012 upon the proviso that he enter into a recognizance to comply with the conditions contained in the draft document that is annexed to these reasons.  The period during which the conditions will operate and in respect of which compliance is required is to be 18 months.  106The orders of the Court are:  1. Leave to appeal is granted.  2. The appeal is allowed and the sentences passed upon the offender on 2 December 2010 are quashed.  3. In lieu thereof, the following sentences are imposed:  (a) In relation to count 1, having regard to the Schedule of offences, the offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 1/2 years commencing on 2 December 2010 and expiring on 1 June 2013.  (b) In relation to counts 2-19, the offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 2 years, each term to commence on 2 December 2010 and expiring on 1 December 2012.  (c) In relation to count 20, having regard to the Schedule of offences, the offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 2 June 2012 and expiring on 1 December 2013.  (d) In relation to counts 21-25, the offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 16 months, each term to commence on 2 June 2012 and expiring on 1 October 2013.  (e) We specify a single pre-release period of imprisonment of 15 months to commence on 2 December 2010 and to expire on 1 March 2012.  We order that, upon the expiry of the 15 month period of imprisonment specified, the offender be released upon his entering into a recognisance self in the sum of $1,000 to observe and comply with the conditions set out in the document annexed to hereto and marked ""A"".  In compliance with the provisions of s 20 Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), the obligation to so observe and comply will be for a period of 18 months from 1 March 2012.  Annexure ""A""  Conditions of a Recognizance release order under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) - John Joseph HARTMAN - (herein called ""the offender"")  The offender upon entering into a security, self in the sum of $1,000, undertakes that he will be of good behaviour for the period of this recognizance and that he must comply with the following conditions, oversight of which is to be administered by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service (""the officer""): -  1.

		12 December 2011",2011-12-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708836,Lovoni v R [2011] NSWCCA 289,"Judgment 

1BLANCH J: This is an appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed at Wollongong District Court. The applicant was convicted after trial on a charge of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing on 26 August, 2009 contrary to s112(2) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and a standard non-parole period of five years. He was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and three months to commence 26 August 2009, the date of his arrest, and expire on 25 November 2012 with a parole period of one year and nine months to commence on 26 November 2012. He was on parole at the time of the offence. His parole was revoked and the balance of his parole did not expire until 15 November 2009. 

The facts 
2At about 10.00 a.m. on 26 August 2009 Mrs Kathy Wallace left her home at 32 Bridges Road, Gerringong in order to drive to her mother's house which was not far away. When she left her home it was locked and secure. As she was leaving she saw two males walking west from the park at the corner of Bridges Road and Fern Street. They were walking in her direction. She also noticed a black Commodore registered number ABM 84D parked and unattended in the park. The males were walking from the direction of the Commodore up towards Mrs Wallace's home. 

3Mrs Wallace had left to attend her mother's house. She was to give her mother a lift to Wollongong to attend a medical appointment. Mrs Wallace senior had a dog and it was necessary to return from her mother's home to 32 Bridges Road in order to leave the dog at Mrs Wallace's home. When she returned there at about 10.15 she saw that her front door was open and the door from the garage into the house was also open. As she entered the building she could hear footsteps upstairs. The two males that she had seen earlier in Bridges Road were in the top storey of the two-storey home. They went out onto the balcony and proceeded to jump off it. Each was carrying a bag of property which had been taken from Mrs Wallace's home. 

4It would appear that the applicant climbed down onto a bin on the driveway and that the co-offender jumped onto the ground in the front yard of the house. He dropped his bag and then picked it up. Mrs Wallace had also sought to pick up the bag of goods and there was a struggle between Mrs Wallace and the co-offender. The co-offender told Mrs Wallace that he had a knife and swung at Mrs Wallace, a closed fist missing her head but causing her fear and causing her to let go of the bag. Both the applicant and the co-offender then ran east along Bridges Road towards Fern Street. 

5The shouting of Mrs Wallace and her mother alerted neighbours who contacted police. They also alerted an off duty police officer, Senior Constable Paul Gregory Winston, who was on his roof in that street seeking to repair it. As the co-offender and the applicant ran towards the Commodore, Senior Constable Winston announced his office and called upon them to stop. The applicant turned away from the vehicle and ran in the direction of an old church known as Chittick Lodge, a Uniting Church property. He then ran on in the direction of Henry Lee Drive. The co-offender ran to the rear of the church with the bag containing a laptop and other items. Senior Constable Winston again informed the co-offender of his office, told him that he was under arrest and told him to lie on the ground. The co-offender did not comply and confronted the senior constable. There was then an altercation between the senior constable and co-offender, in which no part was played by the applicant. 

6The interaction between Senior Constable Winston and the co-offender took them towards the black Commodore in which the co-offender told the police officer that he had a gun. In addition, in a struggle, the co-offender kicked Senior Constable Winston in the head. He then backed away and the co-offender moved away and started to walk down a nearby driveway with the officer following at a distance of about three metres. Again Senior Constable Winston demanded that the co-offender surrender himself and acknowledge that he had been arrested but he continued to resist. 

7Eventually other police arrived at the scene and there was then a concerted attempt by police to find both of the offenders now known to be the co-offender and the applicant. The vehicle was identified as being owned by Thomas Vale of Flinders and it was subsequently ascertained that Mr Vale had lent his vehicle to the co-offender on the morning of this day. The police secured a perimeter around a significant area of Gerringong. During the time the perimeter was in place, police were informed by a witness that there was a male hiding in a bush at the front of premises in Henry Lee Drive. 

8In spite of conflicting evidence at the trial as to who this person was, the jury accepted that the person was the applicant. 

9The witness then checked where the male had been hiding and located a laptop, two iPods, a PSP game console, an ANZ card, a camera and a pair of Australian sports socks. 

10The applicant was ultimately approached by the police at the southern end of Werri Beach. He was searched and the police found 25 dollars in two Australian notes, a twenty dollar note and a five dollar note. The applicant was arrested at 12 noon and taken to Port Kembla Police Station where he declined to be interviewed and declined to participate in an identification parade. 

11The co-offender was located hiding beneath premises in Sharwood Place, Gerringong and was arrested. 

12Examination of the premises at 32 Bridges Road, Gerringong showed that the front timber door had been forced and the entire premises ransacked. 

13All the items stolen from the house were recovered, including 25 dollars in notes which Mrs Wallace had left on a kitchen bench with a school permission note for her daughter. 

The grounds of appeal 
14I note grounds of appeal 1 and 2 have been abandoned. 

Ground 3: His Honour impermissibly fettered his discretion in considering the allowance for special circumstances 
15The complaint made here is in reality that the non-parole period should have been shorter to allow a longer period on parole. The non-parole period specified represents a ratio of 65 per cent rather than the normal statutory ratio of 75 per cent. 

16In R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 it was held the primary consideration in determining special circumstances should be the length of the minimum period of incarceration. The Court went on to say the length of the parole period is significant and in some cases it will be desirable for it to be long. The decision as to the length of the parole period is a matter for the judge to assess and in the normal case this Court would not interfere in that assessment, unless there are clear reasons for doing so. In this case it was assessed that a parole period of one year and nine months was appropriate and bearing in mind the criminal history of the applicant, I see no reason to disagree with that assessment. 

Ground 4: The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when considering the sentence imposed on the co-offender Robert Campbell 
17The co-offender Campbell entered a plea of guilty before Judge Conlon and he entered that plea to the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal. Judge Conlon also took into account on a Form 1 the common assault offence involving Mrs Wallace and two other offences. The sentence Judge Conlon imposed was one of four years with a three year non-parole period. That sentence involved a discount of 25 per cent which the judge in this case noted involved a starting point of a sentence of five years and four months. 

18This applicant was 26 years of age and the co-offender was 36 years of age. They were both on parole at the time of the offence. The co-offender had a criminal record involving sentences of imprisonment including for break, enter and steal and he had served a term of eight years with a five year non-parole period for aggravated armed robbery. The sentencing judge reduced the sentence for this applicant to less than five years and four months because of considerations of parity. The sentencing judge also took into account a dysfunctional upbringing where his mother was an Aborigine and his father Fijian and his father drank significant amounts of alcohol and was physically abusive. The death of his father led to depression and the use of illicit drugs. Judge Conlon found a similar background existed in respect of the co-offender. 

19The sentence ultimately imposed was one of five years with a non-parole period of three years and three months. That sentence was less than the notional starting point of the co-offender of five years and four months. The question then comes down to whether there is a disparity bearing in mind the co-offender entered a plea of guilty but had extra matters taken into account on the Form 1. 

20In Postiglione v The Queen (1996-1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ it was said: 
""However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen , recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to 'a justifiable sense of grievance'."" 

21At page 309 McHugh J said: 
""If a judge wrongly fails to give effect to the parity principle, an appellate court will intervene to correct what is an error in sentencing principle. In Lowe v The Queen , Gibbs CJ, with whom Wilson J agreed, said that an appellate court should intervene where 'the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done'. Mason J stated that an appellate court is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance. Dawson J, with whom Wilson J also agreed, was of the view that '[t]he difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive and call for the intervention of an appellate court in the interests of justice'."" 

22At page 323 Gummow J said: 
""The principle for which Lowe is authority appears to be that the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes where the difference between the two sentences is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done. 

In R v Taudevin (1996) 2 VR 402 at 404 , Callaway JA said, in a passage with which I agree: 

'The important words are 'manifestly', 'justifiable' and 'objective'. There is much to be said for the view that all three requirements are variations on the same theme, ie that only a manifest discrepancy in the sense of a difference that is clearly excessive will satisfy the other two requirements."" 

23And at page 335 Kirby J said: 
""The removal of serious and unjustifiable disparities in the treatment of like cases is a legitimate goal of the administration of criminal justice."" 

24It is evident from these authorities that a simple disparity is not enough and in order to attract appellate intervention it must be categorised as a manifest discrepancy in the sense of a difference that is clearly excessive. Moreover in R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247, it was said this Court would reserve a discretion not to intervene or intervene to only a limited degree where it is apparent that the sentence under comparison was unjustifiably lenient. 

25In this case there was a reduction of four months in the head sentence from that imposed on the co-offender. In the end result he will spend three months longer in custody and be on parole for one year and nine months instead of the one year the co-offender will be on parole. In view of the different considerations in the two cases, I do not believe it can be said this is a marked disparity which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance and I would dismiss this ground of appeal. 

Ground 5: The head sentence and the non-parole period are manifestly excessive 
26In Vuni v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 171 at paragraph 33 Hoeben J said: 
""To establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" ( Dinsdale (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325). This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle. Most pertinently the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge. ( Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 at [26] - [28])."" 

27In this case the maximum penalty is one of 20 years and there is a standard non-parole period of five years. Both of those factors have to be taken into account together with the objective and subjective features of this case which include the fact the applicant was on parole. Bearing all those factors in mind, I do not believe it can be said this sentence is manifestly excessive. 

28I propose the following orders: 

(1)Grant leave to appeal. 

(2)Dismiss the appeal. 

29SIMPSON J: I agree. 

30ROTHMAN J : I agree with the orders proposed by Justice Blanch and the reasons he has given. 

31SIMPSON J: The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Justice Blanch.

		22 December 2011",2011-11-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708853,R v Loughrey [2011] NSWSC 1456,"Judgment  1HER HONOUR :  On 5 January 2011 Matthew Peter Loughrey, a mental health patient at Bloomfield Hospital in Orange, attacked a nurse, Emily Pritchard, whilst armed with a knife.  She suffered multiple lacerations to her hand.  Another nurse, Robert Fenwick, intervened and was fatally stabbed in the chest. He also received injuries to his face, right wrist, palm and thumb, upper right forearm and left ring finger.  2On 30 September 2011 Mr Loughrey was charged with wounding Ms Pritchard with intent to murder her and with the murder of Mr Fenwick.  3On 25 October he was arraigned before me and pleaded not guilty to both charges on the grounds of mental illness as provided for in s 22 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act"").  4With the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and with leave granted under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the trial was fixed for 4 November 2011 and to proceed on that date without a jury.  5The sole issue at trial was whether Mr Loughrey had discharged the onus of establishing that he should be acquitted of both charges on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to s 38 of the Act.  This is sometimes referred to as a special verdict. The defence is made out if I am satisfied that, more probably than not, at the time of the offences Mr Loughrey was suffering from a mental illness such that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  6In R v Waterlow [2011] NSWSC 326 Hidden J, in considering the test for mental illness as I have stated it, also said:  [17] The test was explained by Sir Owen Dixon in his summing-up to the jury in a murder trial in Canberra in 1933, in which the issue was mental illness: The King v Porter (1936) 55 CLR 182. Although couched in the language of a past generation, it would be difficult to find a more lucid explanation of it. Speaking of the accused in that trial, His Honour said (at 189-90):  ""... The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.""  7The Crown did not seek to persuade me that a special verdict ought not be entered in this case.  8By consent, and without objection, the Crown tendered: an agreed statement of facts; a number of witness statements; transcripts of recorded conversations between police and Mr Loughrey; a transcript of a recorded conversation between police and Mr Fenwick on the day of the attack; photographs of Ms Pritchard's injuries and the knives used in the attack; and a medical report from Dr Samson Roberts, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 31 August 2011.  9Mr Hamill SC relied upon the following psychiatrists' reports:  (1)Dr Stephen Allnutt, dated 3 May 2011 and 13 July 2011;  (2)Dr Olav Nielssen, dated 12 June 2011;  (3)Dr Bruce Westmore, dated 26 July 2011.  10The psychiatric reports from all four consultant psychiatrists reflect a uniformity of opinion that at the time of the fatal attack upon Mr Fenwick and the attack upon Ms Pritchard Mr Loughrey was suffering from a mental illness that deprived him of the capacity to consider the moral or legal consequences of his behaviour.  11Mr Hamill also tendered selected material from the compendious medical records relating to Mr Loughrey's care at Bloomfield which included records of the treatment he has received from other health services dating from the time when the need for medical intervention for his mental disability was first identified as a young boy.  Mr Hamill also relied upon a statement from Mr Loughrey's mother, which was received after the hearing but with the express consent of the Crown.  12No oral evidence was called in the proceedings.  Facts  13Bloomfield Hospital is a mental health care facility providing acute and non-acute inpatient care for the residents of Orange, Bathurst, Dubbo, Broken Hill and surrounding areas.  14In January 2010 Mr Loughrey was admitted to Dubbo Base Hospital under Schedule 1 of the Mental Health Act 2007 after having kicked, punched and pushed his mother with whom he was then residing at Goodooga, a relatively remote rural community near Brewarrina in north-western New South Wales. She raised her concerns about her son's behaviour with the hospital but attempts to have him assessed at that time were thwarted by floods.  The hospital notes record that the assault was committed while Mr Loughrey was expressing delusional thoughts.  These are not further described.  Prior to his eventual admission to Dubbo Base Hospital, his mother reported that he was agitated and ransacking the house for poison, apparently with the intention of committing suicide.  When emergency services arrived at his mother's home he swam across the river and hid, not returning until the following morning.  15The hospital notes also record that he had been discharged from the Dubbo Mental Health Inpatient Unit in December 2009 after a 52-day admission with no definite diagnosis but with what was described as definite evidence of psychosis with delusions and some (mild) thought disorder.  His toilet habits were described as bizarre with associated poor personal hygiene.  Prior to his discharge, attempts were made to find him a placement to deal with what were described as his chronic problems, which apparently proved unsuccessful.  16He was detained as an involuntary patient at the Dubbo Base Hospital in January 2010 for 36 days before being transferred to Bloomfield where it was envisaged that he would benefit from a program specific to his needs, addressing first his toileting problem and then the need for him to develop appropriate socialisation skills to facilitate his integration into the community.  The discharge summary notes that he was thought disordered on transfer and would likely require long-term antipsychotic therapy possibly with Clozapine, an antipsychotic medication with particular efficacy in the treatment of resistant schizophrenia over other antipsychotic medication .  It is clear that Clozapine was not incorporated into his treatment regime at Bloomfield.  It was also noted at that time that he had a history of poor compliance with medication which he took impulsively and infrequently.  17The order for his admission as an involuntary patient expired in April 2010.  He remained at Bloomfield as a voluntary patient thereafter until his arrest on 5 January 2011.  He has been remanded in custody since that time.  18At the time of the stabbing Mr Loughrey was receiving what Dr Nielssen regarded as relatively low doses of the antipsychotic medications Quetiapine 400mg and Risperidone 2mg at night, together with 1200mg of valproate twice daily.  It is only since his remand that he has received treatment with Clozapine.  After a recent review of Mr Loughrey's current mental functioning, Dr Roberts confirmed that his condition has improved which he attributes directly to a review and monitoring of his medication, in particular the incorporation of Clozapine.  He said that Mr Loughrey had less thought disorder with less intrusion of delusional material into his conversation. He continues to be managed by a low dose of the antidepressant Sertraline and the mood stabiliser Sodium Valporate.  He also takes a thyroid replacement medication, Thyroxine, at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.  19Dr Roberts said that with a closely monitored treatment regime with Clozapine, he would expect Mr Loughrey to continue to improve over the upcoming months.  He said that the question of complete remission remains uncertain.  20At the time of his arrest Mr Loughrey resided at the ""Moonya Cottages"", a unit within the Bloomfield Hospital grounds where patients aged between 18 and 65 with severe mental illness are housed.  The cottages are self-contained with a kitchen and living area to which the patients have unrestricted access.  The patients residing in the cottages are considered to be at low risk of self harm, or harming others.  Dr Scott Clark, Clinical Director of Psychiatry for the Greater Western Area Health Service, advised that the patients at Moonya Cottages are considered to be capable of living in shared accommodation and to actively engage in various rehabilitation programs, both on and off the Bloomfield campus, with the potential to transition to living in the wider community in time.  21These patients are also assessed as unlikely to leave the hospital of their own accord although, so far as Mr Loughrey was concerned, it appears that there was no impediment or restriction on him being able to leave Bloomfield if he wished, subject to leave being applied for and granted. This was Mr Loughrey's mother's understanding.  It is also reflected in the clinical notes from Bloomfield.  On 7 June 2010 there is a note to the following effect:  I explained to MHW (Mental Health Worker from Lightning Ridge) that we were not doing anything for [Mr Loughrey] here except for medication and as he is a voluntary patient he is free to go as he is a voluntary patient he is free to go as the Psychiatrist feels this is the most suitable arrangement for [Mr Loughrey] at this stage.  22I do note, however, that Mr Loughrey told his mother that on one occasion he had walked down the main road leading to Orange (which is approximately 3.5km from the hospital) until a staff member recognised him and brought him back to hospital.  In addition, before Mr Loughrey could visit his family in Sydney over the 2010 Christmas period, it was necessary that he apply for leave which was to be subject to the approval of a psychiatrist, doubtless with a view to ensuring that he was provided with adequate medication for self administration.  When he left on that occasion he was supplied with enough medication for a month.  He left Bloomfield on 24 December 2010 but returned four days later as his mother apparently resolved not to take him home to Goodooga as planned.  The evidence was silent as to why this was so.  23It would appear to me that whilst Mr Loughrey may have officially had no restriction or impediment to being able to leave Bloomfield, his movements were nonetheless controlled to some extent.  This has some significance in light of what Mr Loughrey said to Mr Fenwick after the struggle and when he had been disarmed.  The day of the incident  24Ms Pritchard and Mr Fenwick arrived to work at 2.45pm on 5 January 2011.  Mr Loughrey was well known to Mr Fenwick.  Mr Fenwick was an experienced psychiatric nurse who had been working at Bloomfield for many years. He was aged 63 at the time of his death.  Ms Pritchard completed her training as an Endorsed Enrolled Nurse and qualified in April 2010. She commenced work at Bloomfield in September/October 2010.  She was aged 20.  She worked two shifts in the Moonya Cottages prior to the incident, a night shift when she did not engage with any of the patients, and a day shift when Mr Fenwick introduced her to the patients, including Mr Loughrey.  That was on 4 January 2011.  25On 5 January 2011 she said that they were preparing to commence their rounds of the Cottages when Mr Fenwick received a telephone call from Mr Loughrey inquiring as to who would be the nurse accompanying him on his rounds that day.  Mr Fenwick told him that it was none of his business.  Ms Pritchard said that she observed Mr Loughrey following them whilst on their rounds.  26Mr Fenwick said that he and Ms Pritchard arrived at Cottage 10 just after 3.30pm.  Whilst he administered an injection to a male patient in one of the bedrooms of the cottage Ms Pritchard waited outside to afford the patient some privacy.  She then saw Mr Loughrey standing at the door of the cottage.  He said, ""Is Bob there? Is he busy?"".  She told him that Mr Fenwick was busy.  Mr Fenwick (who apparently overheard the conversation) told Mr Loughrey to go away and that he would be out in a minute.  Mr Loughrey then proceeded to open the door.  Ms Pritchard directed him not to come inside but to wait for Mr Fenwick outside.  Mr Loughrey then lunged at her with what she described as a serrated knife, severely lacerating her right hand which she had raised to protect her face.  She screamed and ran into the bedroom passing Mr Fenwick as he headed out of the bedroom towards Mr Loughrey.  As she cowered on the floor by the bed she saw Mr Fenwick wrestling with Mr Loughrey who was, according to Mr Fenwick, wildly swinging punches.  The patient was at this time face down on the bed.  Mr Fenwick repeatedly told Mr Loughrey to drop the knife.  He refused saying, ""Just let me kill her.  I want to kill her"".  It was at this time that he saw the knife and managed to push Mr Loughrey against the screen door.  Mr Loughrey continued to resist Mr Fenwick's attempts to contain him.  Mr Fenwick told police that he felt a punch to his chest and then realised he was losing a lot of blood.  He then said that as he attempted to manoeuvre Mr Loughrey outside he was cut on the back of the hand.  Mr Fenwick eventually used a broom both to hit out at Mr Loughrey and to defend himself against the continued attack.  He said he managed to send an alert via the two-way radio.  He said that when Mr Loughrey backed off a little (that is, after Mr Fenwick had been stabbed) he said ""I want your car keys.  Where are your car keys?"".  27As Mr Fenwick and Mr Loughrey were wrestling inside the cottage Ms Pritchard could see that the front of Mr Fenwick's shirt was soaked in blood.  She also alerted security, and then pleaded with the patient to get up and help.  He got up off the bed and ran to where Mr Loughrey was continuing to lunge at Mr Fenwick.  Eventually the patient managed to shove Mr Loughrey towards the front door and outside where he endeavoured to contain him on the front lawn.  Ms Pritchard ran out of the back of the cottage and around the side to the front by which time security had arrived.  One of the security guards escorted Mr Loughrey a short distance from the scene and sat him down under a nearby tree.  Mr Loughrey said to him, ""I've stabbed Bob"".  He also said that he was aiming for Mr Fenwick's heart and that the knife broke and the rest of the knife was in his coat pocket.  A knife with a broken blade was found by police on the pathway in front of the cottage.  The blade was found in Mr Loughrey's jacket which was found on the lawn.  A second knife was found in the grass nearby.  28Mr Loughrey was immediately taken to the acute adult unit at Bloomfield Hospital within the hospital complex where he was spoken to by Dr Patfield, psychiatrist.  29Mr Fenwick was conveyed to Orange Base Hospital in a critical but stable condition and was later that evening transferred to Westmead Hospital in Sydney.  On 6 January 2011 he died from a stab wound to the chest that penetrated his heart.  The wounds to his hands and wrists were considered defensive injuries.  30Ms Pritchard suffered a sharp laceration to the ulnar border of the right little finger that severed the tendons and nerves in that finger.  Mr Loughrey's account to Dr Patfield  31At about 4pm (that is, within 30 minutes of the attack) Mr Loughrey was detained under the authority of a Mental Health Schedule signed by Dr Patfield.   In his statement he says:  [Mr Loughrey's] account of events was somewhat confused but he said the following.  (I refer to my notes made shortly after the interview).  ""I tried to get the female but the male got in the way"".  He told me twice that he had heard that a local chiropractic practice called ""Spine Alive"" had the ability to ""bring them back to life"".  His thinking was disorganised but he appeared to believe that if he killed a nurse, Spine Alive would be able to bring him or her back to life.  He seemed to agree with my suggestion that he must have been angry with the nurse - he said of the female nurse in a dismissive voice that she was ""just a typical Australian"".  ...  My assessment after my brief interview and review of his history was that he was suffering from an acute paranoid psychosis.  Aggression had apparently not been a major issue in the past but he clearly appeared to be dangerous at this point.  He was made an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act with the plan that he be managed in the MHICU with individual monitoring by security staff, at least overnight.  He was prescribed appropriate antipsychotic medication.  He was taken into police custody the following morning.  Mr Loughrey's admissions to police  32At 4.29pm police attended the secure unit and had a conversation with Mr Loughrey in which he admitted stabbing Mr Fenwick and Ms Pritchard. Although there was no objection to the tender of the interview, I raised with counsel my concerns at its reliability in circumstances where Mr Loughrey was a mental patient and had within the previous 30 minutes been administered antipsychotic medication by Dr Patfield; where police (quite legitimately) pressed Mr Loughrey to account (or to try to account) for his behaviour by repeated questioning; and where some of his answers suggested that he decided to harm, if not to kill Mr Fenwick and Ms Pritchard in retaliation at the quality of the treatment he was receiving at the hospital.  Were this a predominating rationale for Mr Loughrey arming himself and stabbing both nurses the defence of mental illness might not have been available to him.  However, upon closer analysis of what Mr Loughrey told police throughout the interview and what he had told Dr Patfield within a very short time of the assaults , and after taking into account that a transcript of the police interview in a question and answer format might convey a sense of ordered thinking that an audio recording might belie, I have concluded that Mr Loughrey's attempt to explain his conduct does not derogate from the conclusions reached by the consultant psychiatrists as to his mental functioning and capacity at the relevant time.  33Mr Loughrey was interviewed by each of the consultant psychiatrists over intervening months and each reported upon his diminished capacity to consider the moral or legal consequences of his behaviour.  They also took into account what Mr Loughrey told police which did not dissuade them from coming to the independent, but ultimately collective, view that Mr Loughrey's mental illness was such that the defence of mental illness was open to him . I will consider their evidence in detail later.  Suffice to note at this time that all doctors reported that they had difficulty in obtaining a coherent account of the offence from Mr Loughrey.  Dr Westmore noted that Mr Loughrey provided ""a very disorganised, dislocated, over inclusive history which was a reflection of his continuing psychotic state"".  Dr Allnutt said that he ""presented as tangential, moving off the topic and it was difficult to follow his logic; he had difficulty staying on task; he frequently asked [him] what was the question I had asked"".  34Mr Loughrey told police that he broke into the Nurses Station, which was attached to the cottage in which he resided, to obtain the knives that he ultimately used in the attack and, it would seem with that intention.  Later in the interview he said that he got the knives because he wanted to ""get the keys and drive away"".  This was consistent with what he told Mr Fenwick minutes after the attack.  He was unable to explain why he would resort to getting a knife if he merely wanted to obtain a key to drive away from the hospital.  35Mrs Loughrey provided the following information in regard to Mr Loughrey's driving skills:  Matthew used to drive around our property, which comprises approximately 22000 acres.  Whilst he could drive, he never obtained a provisional or unrestricted driver's licence although at one stage he held a learner's permit, however, he hardly drove at all on a public road, perhaps at most, only on two or three occasions.  36She also informed me that her son spent time over Christmas in Sydney with her family and that on his return to Bloomfield on 28 December 2010 he did not appear to her to have any objection or resistance to being returned to the hospital.  37Mr Loughrey also informed police that after encountering difficulty gaining access to the Nurses Station he caused some damage.  ( I t would appear that he smashed a coffee mug and dented a number of the doors of nurses' lockers.  He told Dr Nielssen that he knew where the knives were kept in a locked drawer and he forced it open because he ""felt so angry"".)  After ultimately getting the knives he said he put them in the top pocket of his jacket and went to find Mr Fenwick and Ms Pritchard in order to confront them.  He said he put the knives in his jacket in order to avoid suspicion and ""so they wouldn't see them until it was too late for them"".  While this also suggests a degree of rational forethought, for the reasons I have discussed it does not, in my assessment, undermine the availability of the defence of mental illness.  38Mr Loughrey told police that he had obtained the knives because he was ""sick of being in hospital"".  When questioned by police as to the reason why he used the knives to attack the nursing staff he said:  I'm sick of the medicines, I think they're going around in circles.  I think they have no records of my past, they're just simply going over old, old medicines, and I just, I just have no one, no one, no feedback.  And no one to supervise, so I just wanted to do something.  I felt angry, I felt angry quite often and other things.  ...  My diagnosis changes every time I talk to a psych nurse.  I'm sure the computer says something different every time...  ...  They just stick to the treatments in the Mental Hospital.  They seem to just repeat them over, they don't seem to keep any records of what they've already tried.  39Mr Loughrey said that when he arrived at Cottage 10 on 5 January he learnt that Mr Fenwick was administering an injection to another patient.  He said:  ... I thought that was my chance.  So I stepped in, and I knew there would be a ... struggle.  And she withdrawed (sic), to the male nurse who was trying to finish giving the injection.  And he, he charged up.  40He said that he struck Ms Pritchard with the knife before she ran into the room and before Mr Fenwick intervened on her behalf.  He said that he ""didn't have much of a plan"" and that he ""didn't think it out"".  However, he subsequently said that he intended to aim for Ms Pritchard's chest with the knife but that he:  ... didn't get the chance.  [He] missed the chance.  And [he] missed the head and [he] missed the back of the neck.  41The following exchange then took place between Detective Senior Constable Grey and Mr Loughrey:  Q: Is your reason in wanting to stab her in those locations, is that intentionally to inflict serious injury upon her or to kill her?  Even if it was just a spur of the moment thing, what was going through your mind...  A: It would have been better off over the top of the head.  That would have killed her ... Bob.  I suppose I should of hit him on the top of the head too, he wouldn't of known it.   Q: Alright.  So basically you're telling me you didn't have a plan but your intention was to go there to seriously hurt this nurse or to kill her with the knives.  Is that right? ... Or was it the case that you just hadn't...  A: Look ... I wanted to do something.  I've had nothing to do for days.  People don't talk to me.  Q: Alright.  So ...  A: ... something to do ... kill someone and ... people read about it with my diagnoses.  Q: Alright.  So you've got to a stage where you've had enough?  A: ... I don't like the... community and the other patients don't talk to me.  And the staff have to do their work and won't ... [inaudible] without me.  No one takes me on car trips because I'm an embarrassment on the Tetralin.  [Tetralin is a hydrocarbon whose molecular structure is similar to naphthalene.  There is no evidence as to whether his clothing was treated with Tetralin.  It would certainly not be ingested.]  42Later in the interview, when he was further questioned as to whether he intended to kill Ms Pritchard, he said that it was his intention to ""knock her out, unconscious"".  43He said that Mr Fenwick approached him and tried to wrestle the knife from his hand.  He said that Mr Fenwick ""didn't seem to want to hurt [him]"".  He described Mr Fenwick as a ""nice person, a very nice person"".  He said that he stabbed Mr Fenwick ""once and again and again"" to his chest and neck/shoulder area.  He agreed that the patient that Mr Fenwick had been tending to before the attack pushed him out the door of the cottage and attempted to overbear him.  Mr Loughrey said that when he showed the other patient the knife he ""backed off"".  Mr Loughrey said that Mr Fenwick picked up a broom and began hitting him with it.  He said that he managed to get hold of it and continued to stab Mr Fenwick in the chin/neck/collarbone area.  He said he heard Mr Fenwick instruct Ms Pritchard to press her duress alarm after which security and other staff members arrived at the scene.  44When further questioned about his intentions, the following conversation took place between Mr Loughrey and Detective Senior Constable Grey:  Q: Do you know why you did, Matthew do you...  A: ... just thought I'd do something.  Q: So this incident happened because you just needed to let people know what?  That you're not getting the treatment that you need?  That you're not happy with the medication you need, I'm just...  A: I'm not achieving anything.  People are frightened of me.  And they, they just fob me off with anything.  Q: Alright.  What aren't you achieving?  What do you want to achieve?  A: You wouldn't believe me.  Q: Do you want to tell me or not?  A: [No reply]  Q: Well what did you have to achieve by getting the knives?  A: I told you I would have been better off aiming at the top of their heads.  It would have killed either of them.  Q: Did. You said...  A: It just would have knocked them unconscious until, until somebody raised the alarm.  But I probably would have had a lot of (blood?)...[inaudible]...to do the same thing.  Q: Well what would be the objective of knocking them on the head and knocking them out?  A: Stabbing them on top of the head, I would have knocked them out I imagine, and they have got to arrive at hospital to be stabilised I'd imagine.  See I believe in these ... chiropractors that I believe in, they bring people back when things happen to them.  Q: Chiropractors?  A: Yeah ... I think they're witch doctors, they must be.  I saw a fellow in Lightning Ridge, ... I was accused of not taking my medicine, the same afternoon I saw, after I saw him in the morning.  You can feel the pulling inside your body as he runs the electricity over the outside.  Q: And this is someone you went and saw is it?  A: Yes, in Lightning Ridge ... and people survive.  Q: Alright ... explain to me.  And this is the last time I'll ask you.  Can you explain to me why you took the knives and confronted the two nurses?  What was your intention?  A: Because I stabbed them.  It doesn't change the fact that I've stabbed them at...  Q: So why did you stab Bob then?  A: The other, some of the English nurses humour me.  And I changed my mind.  Q: Is the reason you stabbed Bon, is because he got in between you and the female nurse?  A: Yeah. He was serious.  Q: He was serious?  A: He, even though he's an old man, he didn't humour me.  Q: He responded serious because it was serious situation Matthew, and he was trying to stop you.  Did you think that might be the case?  That he didn't want you to hurt the female nurse.  Can you see Bob, why Bob would do that?  Do you understand why Bob do that, to protect someone?  A: I suppose for a duty of care.  Q: And this is the last time I'll ask you this, and you don't have to answer which I've told you the whole time.  Was it your intention to kill that female nurse with the knives?  A: It was my intention to knock her out, unconscious.  Mr Loughrey's mental health  45Mr Loughrey has over the years been described as a ""diagnostic dilemma"".  He has received a variety of diagnoses including developmental disorder, conduct disorder, autistic spectrum disorder (including Asperger's syndrome), schizotypal personality disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder.  Not surprisingly, this has been productive of a variety of treatments and interventions culminating in his residency at Bloomfleld Hospital . Since early childhood he has been treated with the following medications: methylphenidate, dexamphetamine, thioridazine, fluoxetime, risperidone, amisulpride, olanzapine, mirtazapine, pimozide, venlafaxine, sodium valporate, quietapine, sertraline.  46Mr Loughrey was born in 1977 in Sydney.  He was 33 at the time of the stabbing and is currently 34 years of age.  He is an only child.  His parents' marriage had frequent separations and reconciliations before they finally divorced in 1979 when Mr Loughrey was about 3 years old.  He had limited contact with his father growing up.  He reported being exposed to domestic violence as a child.  47His development was considered normal until the age of 18 months when his mother first noticed some ""slowness"" in his development.  At the age of 3 he stopped talking for a period.  Between the ages of 6 and 8 he was admitted to Arndell Children's Unit, a child and adolescent psychiatry unit at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, after his mother reported hyperactivity, impaired concentration, a low frustration threshold, delayed speech and a severe speech dysfunction.  48Upon discharge from Arndell he was deemed within the ""normal"" range of development for his age, apart from his speech disorder.  He attended school until the age of 10 after which he was home-schooled by his mother.  49He was admitted to Arndell a second time between the ages of 13 and 16.  At the age of 16 or 17 years he moved to Goodooga with his mother and maternal grandmother.  50Mr Loughrey has a long history of behavioural problems with social isolation and poor social skills.  He also has a history of aggression.  He told Dr Allnutt that at the age of 13 or 14 he had been arrested for smashing a window and that he hit a police officer when he was at school.  He recalls pushing something into his grandmother and breaking her finger.  In the past he has threatened hospital staff, damaged hospital property, attempted to set fire to an inpatient unit and assaulted a staff member with a flaming torch and, as I have noted, assaulted his mother which resulted in his being scheduled in January 2010.  51Mr Loughrey is single and has never had a partner.  He has been on a disability support pension since the age of 16.  The only employment he had undertaken is delivering newspapers and working in a sheltered workshop until the age of 16.  Mental state at the time of the offence  52As I have noted above, the consultant psychiatrists hold the unanimous view that at the time of the stabbing Mr Loughrey was suffering from a disease of the mind that prevented him from recognising the moral wrongfulness of his actions and compromised his capacity to understand the nature and quality of his actions.  With the exception of Dr Nielssen, all doctors diagnosed Mr Loughrey with schizophrenia.  Dr Nielssen diagnosed Mr Loughrey with pervasive developmental disorder and a psychotic illness which he did not further identify.  Dr Westmore diagnosed a chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness.  Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that although Mr Loughrey manifests a combination of an autistic spectrum disorder and a chronic psychotic disorder he would likely meet the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia.  Dr Roberts diagnosed Mr Loughrey with schizophrenia based upon the account provided by him of the stabbing which reflected a chronic psychotic illness characterised by delusions and gross disorder of thought.  53In addition, all doctors reported that Mr Loughrey appeared to have delusional beliefs in relation to the consequences of stabbing Mr Fenwick and Ms Pritchard, in that he expressed a belief that his actions would not inflict any or any lasting physical harm as he thought that they could somehow be revived or their injuries healed.  54Dr Roberts said that Mr Loughrey:  ...[held] the expectation that medical and allied health services would be able to rectify any injuries inflicted as a result of his conduct and that they would be able to bring people back to life.  It is apparent that Mr Loughrey was not of the belief, at the time of the incidents for which he is before the Court, that his conduct would have resulted in death.  55Dr Nielssen reported that Mr Loughrey repeatedly expressed the view that Mr Fenwick could somehow be revived by the hospital.  Dr Allnutt reported that when he asked Mr Loughrey what had led him to commit the offence he stated:  I thought the health system could save the nurses from any damage I did to them ... I was trying to prove I could do things on the TV, I thought I could recover [Mr Fenwick's] health ... I thought they'd bring him back by giving him a blood transfusion.  56Dr Westmore noted that:  [Mr Loughrey] was suffering from a disease of the mind (a chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness) which would have totally compromised his capacity to know that he ought not to do the act [of stabbing] and that the act was wrong.  57Dr Allnutt explained that he come to the view that Mr Loughrey was suffering from a disease of the mind compromising his capacity to understand the nature and quality of the actions because:  ... it does not appear that he understood the full impact of the consequences of his actions at the time of the offence as he believed that despite stabbing somebody in some way the outcome would not be as severe as it was ultimately and that this belief was derived from his disordered thinking due to mental illness.  58He went onto say:  ... in my view the incomprehensibility of his reasoning for acting in the manner that he did, is a function of the degree of irrationality in his reasoning and decision making process at the material time; but that at the material time, he felt justified in acting in the manner that he did and incapable of reasoning about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense.  59Dr Nielssen observed that:  ... the information available about his mental state around the time of the offences and the observations of Mr Loughrey during recent intervals all indicate that he was acutely mentally ill at the time of the offence, rather than acting in response to grief.  I believe Mr Loughrey has the defence of mental illness open to him as he has a severe form of mental illness that would be recognised in law to be a disease of the mind, which gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of bizarre beliefs about the staff members and the likely effect of his actions.  His grossly disturbed state of mind prevented him from reasoning with sense or composure about the likely consequences of his actions or recognising that his actions were morally wrong...  Mr Loughrey was not receiving adequate treatment  60It was the collective view of the forensic psychiatrists that at the time of the stabbing Mr Loughrey was not properly diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and, accordingly, not monitored or maintained on appropriate doses of antipsychotic medication.  61Dr Nielssen observed that:  Mr Loughrey was given a diagnosis of hypomania and then schizophreniform (schizophrenia-like) psychosis after his admission to Dubbo Hospital [in January 2010].  However, it seems from the entries in the medical records and Dr Patfield's statement that he had not been given a firm diagnosis of psychotic illness during the months he spent in Bloomfield Hospital, despite treatment with a low dose of antipsychotic medication in that time.  From an examination of the entries in the medical records, there appears to have been an increase in disruptive behaviour in the period before he went on leave and in the days between returning from leave and the offences.  Mr Loughrey attributed the change to a reduction in the dose of medication, but the medical records show that he was receiving treatment with the same low doses during the four days he was on leave [when he returned to Sydney to spend time with his family over Christmas], assuming he took the medication as prescribed.  62I have come to the view on the evidence before me that Mr Loughrey's behaviour on the day of the incident is best understood by reason of a confluence of factors, including the complexity of his underlying condition, a subclinical or at least undetected exacerbation of symptoms of schizophrenia in the days leading up to the attack and, most critically, his ability to obtain access to knives enabling him to inflict serious and fatal injuries on nursing staff - actions that originated in disordered thought which were then coloured by a series of intersecting/contradictory and delusional beliefs.  While I venture to suggest that were he adequately managed and were his behaviour more closely monitored, his uncontrolled impulse to arm himself and launch an attack on the nurses may have been avoided, thereby protecting Ms Pritchard from the risk of injury and preventing Mr Fenwick's tragic death as he heroically went to her aid.  I do not, by that observation, attribute blame to any particular health care professional or those who are responsible for the management of Bloomfield Hospital (and what I must assume is a process of reviewing the appropriateness of a particular patient being treated as low risk and housed in the Cottage environment), if for no other reason than that this proceeding is not the forum for an inquiry of that kind.  Victim impact statements  63I received victim impact statements from Ms Pritchard, Mr Fenwick's wife, Jan Fenwick and his daughter, Kate Fenwick, which I have taken into account in the way I am permitted under the law.  64Ms Pritchard said that the attack has had a physical, emotional, social and psychological impact on her life.  She has not regained full feeling in her finger.  She suffers from Acute Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder including flashbacks, anxiety, bad dreams and depression.  She has noticed a decline in her mood since the attack, which she said has impacted upon her relationships with friends and family.  65Ms Pritchard's work life has also been affected.  She said that her sleeping patterns have been disturbed due to persistently bad dreams.  This consequently impacts on her ability to attend work.  When she is able to attend for work, her duties are restricted.  She says:  ... I am unable to work in the areas I once would have liked to work, I am unable to work shifts and earn penalty rates, and I am unable to perform certain tasks at work which then leads to judgmental comments from some colleagues...  66Mrs Fenwick has suffered significant grief, having lost her husband of 33 years who she described as a ""companion in every way... a calm, reassuring, kind man who was [her] friend as well as [her] partner"".  I understand entirely the difficulty Mrs Fenwick has in coming to terms with the manner in which her husband died.  She expressed feelings of persistent loneliness, sorrow, despondency and heartache, which I accept unreservedly.  67Ms Kate Fenwick has retained memories of the times she shared with her father.  Her loss is compounded by not having been able to say goodbye to him, arriving at the hospital after he lost consciousness.  She has struggled to regain stability in her life since her father's death.  She has experienced various psychological repercussions including disturbed sleeping patterns, a recurring feeling of discomfort around knives and scissors, and a greater sensitivity to the topics of death, killing and mental illness.  68In what I regard as an entirely mature and commendably balanced way, Ms Fenwick expresses regret that the mental health system and Bloomfield Hospital failed to provide the care that Mr Loughrey deserved as a mentally ill patient.  She is bewildered at how he had both means and opportunity to access the knives that killed her father.  69I extend my deepest sympathies to Mr Fenwick's family.  I also recognise the impact of the incident on Ms Pritchard.  I commend her for what I regard as her courage in continuing to pursue a career in nursing when for another young person in her situation a career change would have been entirely understandable.  70I well appreciate that these proceedings and my findings will not ameliorate the unimaginable grief that Mr Fenwick's family has suffered as a result of the senseless death of a beloved son, father and husband and, while I accept that anger and disappointment may surface from time to time in his family and in Ms Pritchard's thoughts and intrusive memories, in our system of justice only the mentally competent are punished as criminal offenders.  71In the special facts of this case I am satisfied that justice has been done under the law by returning a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness.  Orders  72Until released by due process of law I order that Matthew Peter Loughrey be detained under s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 at the Long Bay Prison Hospital subject to the review of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s 44 of the Act.  73In light of Mr Loughrey's current treatment and the regime for his future management, the parties have agreed that I recommend that the Mental Health Review Tribunal give consideration to transferring him to the Forensic Hospital at Malabar as soon as is practicable.  **********

		29 November 2011",2011-11-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708857,Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA : I agree with Simpson J 

2SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 5 November 2010 following his plea of guilty to a single count of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence. The serious indictable offence was stealing. The circumstance of aggravation was that the applicant committed the offence whilst in company. 

3Pursuant to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, the offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act ""), it carries a standard non-parole period of five years. However, as will be explained below, the standard non-parole period can be put to one side. Berman DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months, commencing on 30 November 2009, and ending on 29 May 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months which will expire on 29 May 2012. In doing so, he allowed, in respect of the plea of guilty and pursuant to the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 a reduction of 25%; and, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act , he found special circumstances justifying variation from the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. 

The facts 

4The offence was committed on 16 March 2008. During the evening of that day, the applicant, in company with a female co-offender (who has not been identified) smashed the front glass door of an Australia Post Office in Marrickville. The two offenders entered the premises and removed a large amount of property, predominantly computer related. Also included in the property stolen were a large number of tickets of various kinds for the Royal Easter Show. The value of the property stolen was about $4,250. 

5During the investigation into the offence, a bloodstain was located on a piece of paper in the office. On analysis, it proved to contain DNA consistent with that of the applicant. Although the premises were covered by closed circuit television, the footage obtained was insufficiently clear to identify the applicant; the only evidence upon which the Crown relied was the DNA evidence. However, apparently due to delays in the Division of Analytical Laboratories, the results of DNA testing were not produced to investigating police until October 2009. The applicant was arrested and charged with this offence on 30 November 2009. In the meantime, he was sentenced in relation to other matters. On 19 September 2008 he was sentenced to an aggregate term of 8 months' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 months, in respect of offences of larceny, goods in custody, destruction of property, and related matters; and on 11 March 2009 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months in respect of two counts of stealing. The non-parole period of that sentence expired on 9 November 2009, and the applicant was released on parole. 

6It was three weeks later - on 30 November 2009 - that he was arrested and charged in relation to the present office - committed 20 months earlier. That is a matter that will call for consideration in the context of the grounds of appeal sought to be raised. 

7There was no information provided to the sentencing judge concerning the offences for which the applicant was sentenced in September 2008 and March 2009. That, too, will call for consideration in the context of the grounds sought to be raised on appeal. 

The applicant ' s personal circumstances 

8Before the sentencing judge was a pre-sentence report prepared by Mr Geoffrey Silva, an officer of the Probation and Parole Service. The applicant gave oral evidence, as did his father. From this evidence, the following emerged. The applicant was born in December 1983 and was therefore 24 years of age at the time he committed the offence. He is of Aboriginal heritage, one of ten children of a close and supportive family. His father is involved in the Aboriginal community as a cultural and heritage officer. 

9The applicant has a criminal record that dates back to 2001, when he was about 18 years of age. At that time two concurrent control orders, each of seven months' duration, with an overall non-parole period of three months, were imposed in the Children's Court. When released on parole his response was ""less than satisfactory"". He again appeared in the Children's Court the following year, in respect of offences committed while on parole. On this occasion he was sentenced to a custodial term of 12 months, with a non-parole period of 9 months. Again, his compliance with parole conditions was less than satisfactory. Since then, the applicant has repeatedly been before the courts, for a variety of offences, although, in the sentencing judge's view, of less seriousness than the offence the subject of the present application. 

10The applicant showed promise as a sportsman, particularly in Rugby League, and was given the opportunity to attend selective sports schools. He has worked at times with his father, in Aboriginal Land Council and Aboriginal museums. At about 16 years of age he began using illicit drugs, smoking heroin, which he began injecting at 20. This effectively brought to an end any hope he had of a career as a sportsman. 

11His family remains supportive. His father's evidence was that the family had experienced such concern with the applicant's conduct that they considered themselves involving the police. 

12The applicant gave evidence that in 2004 he had attended a rehabilitation facility, but that, even though he completed the programme, on his discharge he again succumbed to drug use. As at the date of giving evidence (5 November 2010) he was on a methadone programme, and had been so for 18 months. He said that he was attempting to reduce the methadone dose, and substitute another, alternative, drug that he considered would be more beneficial to him. He expressed his intention of achieving rehabilitation, resuming TAFE studies and becoming independent. He has been in a relationship with a young woman for 18 months, which he hopes will continue, and he hopes to have a family in due course. 

13Also in evidence was a letter written by the applicant, addressed to ""Dear Sir/Madam"", which is undated. In this letter the applicant expressed his remorse and regret for his involvement in the offence, and said that he was under the influence of drugs at the time and ""wasn't thinking straight"". He acknowledged that that was no excuse. 

The remarks on sentence 

14Berman DCJ opened his remarks on sentence by commenting on the delay in the provision of the DNA testing. He noted that, in the meantime, the applicant had served a sentence for an unrelated matter and had been released only shortly before being arrested in respect of the present offence. He said: 

""I have begun these remarks by referring to his circumstances because of the injustice that can caused to an offender when inadequate resources are provided to the Division of Analytical Laboratories, such that offenders stand to be sentenced for offences they have committed some considerable time before. In some cases, although this is not one of them, offenders are completely different people, having rehabilitated themselves by the time they stand for sentence on an old offence. I have borne in mind to a significant extent that [the applicant] stands for sentence today for an offence committed a fair while ago."" 

He then recounted the facts of the offence and evidence concerning the applicant's personal circumstances in a manner that has not been challenged. 

15While expressly accepting that the applicant was remorseful, and that he had committed the offence under the influence of drugs, and that he wished ""to put his life of crime behind him"" and rehabilitate himself, his Honour also appears to have harboured some doubt about the prospect of that being achieved. In any event, he held that those circumstances could not override the need to punish the applicant for the offence, nor the need for both personal and general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence. 

16His Honour made, on a number of occasions, specific reference to the standard non-parole period. It is best to quote verbatim what he said, in various parts of his Remarks. His Honour said: 

""It is to be noted that this offence carries with it a standard non-parole period of 5 years, nor is it to be overlooked that the maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment. This is, as both of those figures indicate, a serious offence. 

[The solicitor for the applicant] handed to me Judicial Commission statistics regarding the sentences that have been imposed in the District Court for offences of this kind. They revealed some remarkable circumstances. Of 449 people sentenced to imprisonment since the imposition of the standard non-parole period for offences of this kind, not a single person has received a non-parole period longer than the standard non-parole period and only 1%, five people out of 449, have received the standard non-parole period. In part, that may well be due to the circumstance that most of the people dealt with for that offence have been dealt with for aggravated break, enter and steal. The standard non-parole period, which is of course appropriate to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, would thus be more likely to be imposed for an offence where the indictable offence committed after breaking and entering is a more serious one. 

Even with that qualification it is remarkable that the intention of the legislature does not appear to have been met. That said, I must regard the Judicial Commission's statistics as providing guidance to me as to the sentence I should impose upon the [offender]. ... I will be guided by the Judicial Commission's statistics despite the remarkable features of them that I have mentioned. 

... It was [the applicant's solicitor's] primary submission that having been in custody for just short of one year I should impose a sentence on the [offender] which sees him being released today so that further rehabilitation can take place in the community. I have given anxious consideration to whether I should do what [the solicitor] asks. The primary reasons I will not do what [the solicitor] submitted that I should relate to the length of the standard non-parole period and the length of the maximum penalty which the legislature has provided. 

In view of the [offender's] continuing attitude of disobedience to the law, in view of the absence of demonstrated rehabilitation, in view of the objective gravity of what he did on this occasion, and in view of, as I have just mentioned, the standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty of 20 years, a non-parole period of less than one year would be significantly and manifestly inadequate. ..."" 

17In the course of his Remarks on Sentence his Honour made an express finding that the applicant's offence was ""slightly below"" the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of its type. That was a reference to s 54A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act , the opening section of Pt 4 Div 1A, which specifies that the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of the type under consideration. 

18Returning to the question of delay, his Honour said: 

""I have borne in mind also that had he been arrested for this offence soon after it was committed he might have served the sentence for this offence concurrently with others he has served in the meantime. One difficulty however with accepting what [the solicitor] said about that issue is that I do not know anything about those other offences and so when applying the principle of totality as I must I am hampered by the fact that I know nothing about the other offences for which he was sent to gaol."" 

19His Honour proceeded to make the finding of special circumstances referred to above, giving as one of the reasons for that that the applicant would be serving sentences cumulatively (when, as he had earlier observed, there may have been some concurrency had the circumstances been otherwise). He referred the applicant to the Drug Court for determination as to his suitability for a compulsory drug treatment order. 

The grounds of the application 

20The grounds of the application are pleaded as follows: 

""Ground 1: His Honour failed to properly take into account the principle of totality 

Ground 2: His Honour failed to properly take into account the delay in sentencing 

Ground 3: His Honour failed to inquire further into the nature of the previous offending."" 

1 & 2. Totality/Delay 

21These two grounds are interconnected and can be dealt with together. 

22It is necessary to be clear about the nature of the complaint made. No ground of appeal contends that the sentence, of 4 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, was not appropriate to the circumstances of the offence. When his oral argument appeared to approach such a submission, counsel disclaimed any such intent, but argued that the sentence was, at least, ""getting towards"" being manifestly excessive. That argument was put in the context of the accumulation of the sentence on the previously-imposed 9 months. 

23The real argument, paraphrased, was that consideration of the sentence the subject of this application could not be made in isolation from the applicant's recent history of incarceration. During the course of the sentencing proceedings, the solicitor who then appeared for the applicant put before the sentencing judge what he called a ""time line"". The chronology is as follows: 

16 March 2008: subject offence committed 
9 April 2008: bloodstained paper ""taken"" 
1 May 2008: Reference DNA sample from applicant 
19 September 2008 Applicant sentenced to imprisonment for 8 months, commencing on 29 May 2008, non-parole period 6 months, expiring 28 November 2008 
28 November 2008 Applicant released 
11 March 2009 Applicant sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months, commencing 10 February 2009, non-parole period 9 months, expiring 9 November 2009 
October 2009: DNA results provided to investigating police 
9 November 2009 Applicant released on parole 
30 November 2009 Applicant arrested in respect of present charge. 

(Not all items on the list can be located in the evidence before this Court, but there appears to be no dispute about the accuracy of the chronology.) 

24The point sought to be made by counsel on this application was that, as a result of the delay in DNA testing, the applicant was not, as he otherwise might have been, sentenced at one time for all offences committed after 16 March 2008 (assuming those offences were committed after that date, something which is likely although not confirmed by the evidence). The hypothesis was that, had the applicant been sentenced for all offences at the one time, or for the present offence and one or other of the subsequent offences, the principle of totality would have operated, with the likelihood that the sentences imposed would have had some degree of concurrency, resulting in a reduced total term of imprisonment. As it happens, the applicant has been in custody for 6 months from 29 May 2008 to 28 November 2008, 9 months from 10 February 2009 to 9 November 2009, and from 30 November 2009 to the present, and will, on the orders made by Berman DCJ, remain in custody until at least 29 May 2012. 

25The principal difficulty with the submission, as is evident from those passages of the Remarks on Sentence which I have quoted, and which is seized upon in the formulation of the third ground of appeal, is that Berman DCJ was provided with no information about the subsequent (September 2008 and March 2009) offences, and was in no position to evaluate the extent to which, had they been dealt with together, some concurrency in the sentences imposed would or might have eventuated. 

26It cannot reasonably be said, in the light of passages of the Remarks on Sentence which I have extracted, that his Honour did not take into account either the delay in sentencing, or the principle of totality. His Honour commenced his Remarks by mentioning the delay, and made specific reference to being ""hampered"" in the application of the principle of totality by the lack of information about the subsequent offences. 

27I have concluded that neither of these grounds of the application can succeed. In the circumstances, no error in this regard has been shown in the approach taken by the sentencing judge. 

3. Failure to make inquiries about the subsequent offences 

28This is, in my opinion, a ground of application that can only be characterised as ""bold"". The applicant was, at sentencing, represented by a solicitor who, from the transcript, appears to have been experienced. Either he, or the Crown, could have made available to the sentencing judge the relevant material concerning the subsequent offences. 

29The nature of the ground ignores the fact that, even in sentencing proceedings, the courts of NSW operate on an adversarial system. The roles of counsel and the judge are clearly defined and trespassing by one upon the role of the other is not to be encouraged, certainly not by this Court. It is not the role of a judge to seek out evidentiary material, nor to determine the scope of the evidence put before him or her. Although, when this was raised with counsel on the application, it was said (I have no doubt correctly) that it does happen, in sentencing, that judges sometimes identify additional material that would assist them in the sentencing process, a judge must be very circumspect in intruding into the role of counsel. 

30It is quite unfair to make this criticism of the sentencing judge. 

31I would reject this ground of the application. 

32In the ordinary course, that would result in dismissal of the appeal, assuming leave were granted. However, there is another matter that has arisen since the grounds of this application were formulated. That concerns his Honour's approach to the standard non-parole period. That approach was entirely in conformity with the law as it was then understood, as stated in Way v The Queen [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. In Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 the High Court declared that Way was wrongly decided. Nevertheless, together with the prescribed statutory maximum sentence, the standard non-parole period stands as a ""legislative guidepost"" ( Muldrock , [27]). 

33It will be apparent from the passages of the Remarks which I have quoted above, that his Honour gave considerable emphasis to the standard non-parole period of 5 years. On the other hand, however, he also declared his intention to be guided by the statistics provided to him, which, he said, indicated that the standard non-parole period was not being applied and, by inference, that the decision in Way was not being strictly followed. 

34In my opinion, however, the preponderance of the Remarks indicate that he gave considerable emphasis to the standard non-parole period, particularly in rejecting the submission of the applicant's solicitor that a period of imprisonment of about one year would sufficiently acknowledge the applicant's criminality. (With or without the foundation of the standard non-parole period, that finding was perfectly correct.) 

35It remains the case, even post- Muldrock , that a sentencing judge is to be ""mindful"" of both the maximum sentence for which provision is made, and the standard non-parole period as ""legislative guideposts"": ( Muldrock , at [27]). However, the standard non-parole period is not the starting point in sentencing for a mid-range offence after conviction (at [56]); even less is the standard non-parole period the starting point for sentence after a plea of guilty. 

36Although I have considered it necessary, in fairness to the applicant, to raise the Muldrock issue, I have concluded that no error of the kind exposed in that judgment has been disclosed. While it was not necessary ( Muldrock , [25]) to fix the offence on a scale of objective seriousness that his Honour did so (in accordance with the law as it was understood at the time of sentencing) did not deflect the judge onto an erroneous course. 

37In relation to the pleaded grounds of appeal, I add this. In response to the third ground in particular, the Crown provided the Court with material concerning the offences for which the applicant was sentenced subsequent to the commission of this offence. No objection was taken to our reception of that material, which I have read. It does not persuade me that there was any real likelihood that had it been available to Berman DCJ, he would have reduced the sentence imposed in order to accommodate some notional concurrency, or totality. The offences were of stealing from the person (3 counts), stealing from a retail store, stealing from a motor vehicle, common assault and damage to property, committed over a period from 18 March 2008 to 9 February 2009. They bore no connection to the present offence, and, in my view, did not call for concurrency with the present offence. 

38Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal. 

39HISLOP J : I agree with Simpson J.

2708859,R v WYSE [2011] NSWDC 241,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: On 5 June 2008 a number of police went to the premises of Timothy Andrew Wyse. They were armed with a search warrant. After some delay they managed to gain access to Mr Wyse's premises. He was inside. As police went in he began yelling and flailing his arms around. One of the police officers, Detective Beakman, attempted to restrain him, but through thrashing his arms around Mr Wyse committed an assault on the detective. Mr Wyse was eventually handcuffed and the search of his premises could commence.

2What police discovered was an enormous and varied quantity of drugs, and drug paraphernalia. It is accepted by Ms Evers, who appears for Mr Wyse today, that due to his possession of various drugs, and his possession of what is described as a pen pistol, Mr Wyse has committed offences, ignoring for the moment any issue regarding his mental illness, as set out in the indictment presented this morning. In other words it is conceded that what police found during their search established all of the offences. It is not necessary therefore for me to go through what police have found in great detail, beyond noting that the brief of evidence tendered today by the Crown establishes the accuracy of Ms Evers' concession.

3It became apparent at an early stage in the police investigation that there were at least suspicions that Mr Wyse was mentally unwell. A barrister, Mr Attard, who attended to assist Mr Wyse, informed police that it was his opinion that Mr Wyse was mentally unwell. Then conversations that the officer-in-charge, Detective Sergeant Mullaley, had with Mr Wyse also led the police officer to the same view.

4After he was charged enquiries were made as to his fitness to stand trial. Both Dr Allnutt and Dr Nielssen, highly experienced forensic psychiatrists, formed the view that he was not fit to stand trial. I will return to their diagnoses later.

5A hearing into the accused's fitness was heard under s 10 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, and the judge hearing that matter determined that Mr Wyse was not fit to stand trial. Accordingly he was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, who themselves determined, on 24 August last year, that he was unlikely to become fit to be tried within the next twelve months. That meant that a Special Hearing needed to be held in order to determine whether, on the limited evidence available, Mr Wyse committed the offences with which he had been charged. It is that hearing that began before me this morning.

6It began with the presentation by the Crown of the indictment. The allegations were read to Mr Wyse by my associate, but, in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, he was not asked whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty to them, instead it was taken that he had pleaded not guilty. The Crown then tendered a folder of material containing a number of statements by police, and copies of items found in Mr Wyse's premises on 5 June, as well as reports from Drs Nielssen and Allnutt. That was the Crown case.

7Ms Evers then tendered on behalf of her client a short report from Dr Elsa Bernardi, a report from a registered nurse, and some progress notes. It is the common view of all of those who have examined Mr Wyse that he was, at the time of these offences, that is 5 June 2008, significantly mentally unwell. And it is further the view of Drs Allnutt and Nielssen that because of that illness, on the balance of probabilities, he was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. They therefore expressed the opinion that Mr Wyse should be found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness in relation to each of the charges now before me. Both Mr Crown and Ms Evers say that I should accept the opinions of those doctors. I will do so, but not before indicating that this has not been a decision that I have made simply by accepting the views of these highly qualified and experienced psychiatrists.

8It is not at all apparent that the doctors were made fully aware as to the circumstances surrounding what police found when they entered Mr Wyse's unit. Their opinions would have been much easier to accept if I were satisfied that they received the same material that I had. For example, the Crown tendered, and then later indicated that this was a mistake, some documents that had been found by police which at least raised questions as to Mr Wyse's understanding of what he was doing. It does not appear that those documents were provided to the doctors. What they were given appears to have been a statement of facts prepared by police at a very early stage of the investigation.

9Of course the question as to whether a person understood that what he or she was doing was morally wrong is to be looked at after paying close attention to what they actually did, and it is not at all apparent to me that the doctors were provided with information that would have allowed them to pay that close attention. For example - this is a matter that is referred to in the statement of facts provided to the doctor - Mr Wyse, or at least someone involved with him, had secreted a number of drugs in false compartments in the back of three paintings found in Mr Wyse's home. Of course he may well have understood that it was legally wrong to possess those drugs, but not have believed that it was morally wrong to do so. But I, for one, would have been happier if the doctors had addressed in more detail the consequences of findings such as those made by police.

10As I said earlier, it is undeniable that Mr Wyse was significantly mentally unwell. By the time police turned up on 5 June he had been admitted for psychiatric treatment on a number of earlier occasions. He has expressed the view that he has had a chip placed in his head, and although he denies other common symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices, it is clear that he was at the time delusional to a high degree.

11When Dr Nielssen saw Mr Wyse in late 2008, reasonably soon after he was arrested in June, Dr Nielssen reviewed the material provided to him which suggests a history of disturbed and delusional behaviour, a history of treatment for that, and interviewed Mr Wyse, but was unable to obtain any coherent explanation as to what Mr Wyse was up to. 

12Dr Nielssen formed the view that:

""Mr Wyse had a relapsing psychotic illness that is either schizophrenia, or a schizo-effective disorder."" 

13 He says:

""The diagnosis is made on the basis of the corroborative accounts of symptoms that were present at the time of the previous acute episodes, the content of Mr Wyse's letters, and his presentation at the recent interview. The presence of bizarre beliefs, such as the insertion of a microchip in the brain, are typical of schizophrenia rather than a transient drug induced state. Mr Wyse also seemed abnormally elevated in mood, especially during the initial interview, when he seemed indifferent to his circumstances, and was pre-occupied with a number of unrealistic plans.""

14Dr Nielssen went on to express the opinion that at the time of the events that led to the charges he was facing:

""He was in the acute phase of mental illness"".

although he was able to carry out day to day activities. 

15He said it:

""would have been readily apparent that Mr Wyse was in the acute phase of mental illness, and that his activities were motivated by unrealistic thinking arising from his illness, therefore -""

and this is of course relevant to the ultimate view that I take on this matter - Dr Nielssen said:

""Hence I believe Mr Wyse would be able to raise the defence of mental illness to the charges as his mental illness gave rise to a defect of reason that deprived him of the ability to recognise that his behaviour was wrong.""

16As I mentioned, that was the opinion expressed by Dr Nielssen soon after seeing Mr Wyse in late 2008. Dr Nielssen has provided further reports, but his opinion has not changed. 

17What has happened, as Dr Nielssen reports, is that as a result of consistent treatment Mr Wyse's psychotic illness is now in remission. However, of course, that does not affect the situation that Mr Wyse was in at the time of the charges. Dr Nielssen confirmed his earlier opinion that Mr Wyse would have the defence of mental illness open to him:

""Because of the effect of ideas arising from acute exacerbation of a chronic mental illness on his behaviour, and the gross impairment in his capacity to recognise the moral, and even the legal, consequences of his actions while he was acutely mentally ill.""

18Whilst I may have had some doubts as to whether I could accept Dr Nielssen's opinion concerning Mr Wyse's belief in the legal consequences of actions, it is of course relevant to the test that I have to apply that his illness affected his capacity to recognise the moral consequences, and as I have repeatedly said, there is a unanimous view before me that that impairment was significant to the extent that Mr Wyse has the defence of mental illness available to him.

19I mentioned before that Mr Wyse had also been assessed by Dr Allnutt. His opinion is similar. He says that: 

""Mr Wyse manifests symptoms consistent with schizophrenia currently characterised by language difficulties, formal thought disorder, delusions of grandeur, as well as persecutory beliefs that have impacted on his social and psychological functioning over the years. He has a history of admissions to psychiatric hospitals and trials of anti-psychotic medication.""

20Although in that report, which was dated 11 October 2009, Dr Allnutt did not express a view as to the mental illness defence, he did in a later report, when asked to by the DPP. He said:

""I am of the view that having regard to the account that he provided me at that stage--""

21That is when he saw him earlier:

""That his mental state at the material time of the alleged offence was such that he manifested to me on 1 October 2009--""

22Which I believe is highly probable:

""Then he would be regarded as suffering from a disease of the mind, and in my view would probably have been unable to know the nature and quality of his actions, but more definitely would have been incapable of reasoning about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure.""

23It is to be noted there that Dr Allnutt went further than Dr Nielssen, and expressed the view that he would probably have been unable to know the nature and quality of his actions. 

24Whether I would have accepted that expression of opinion does not need to be determined, but before I could have done so comfortably I would have liked to have known, and been satisfied, that Dr Allnutt was made fully aware of the surrounding circumstances of Mr Wyse's conduct. The reason, of course, that I do not have to determine that matter is because I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that I should accept the second limb of Dr Allnutt's opinion, that concerned with Mr Wyse's appreciation of the wrongfulness of his actions.

25Before I leave the evidence of the psychiatrists I should refer to the documents tendered by Ms Evers. They concern mainly the significant improvement in Mr Wyse's mental state since he resumed treatment. He is now regularly treated with clozapine, and has improved significantly as a result. It is pleasing to see that Mr Wyse has also been compliant with his treatment. Of course the fact that there is a significant difference between Mr Wyse's mental state now that he is treated, and his mental state in June 2008 when he was not being treated, suggests that in a significant way that his activities arose from his mental illness.

26As I mentioned earlier in this judgment, I am satisfied that Mr Wyse was in possession of the various items referred to in counts 1 to 13 of the indictment. Some of the charges on the indictment relate to possession, for example, counts 1, 4 and 13, but I am satisfied that so far as the prosecution needs to also prove a mental element for those counts that it is established that Mr Wyse had the relevant intention. Of course the majority of the charges relate to supply rather than possession, but in circumstances where the onus shifts to the accused to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that he had the drugs in his possession other than for the purpose of supply, and in circumstances where there has been no attempt by Mr Wyse to overcome that onus, I am also satisfied therefore that Mr Wyse has committed those offences of supplying, which appear on the indictment.

27Finally, as I began these remarks, I am satisfied that his conduct when police first entered the premises amounted to an assault of Detective Senior Constable Beakman, and that it was Mr Wyse's intention to prevent himself being lawfully apprehended. Ordinarily that would result in me making a finding that Mr Wyse was guilty of each of the fourteen counts on the indictment, but consistent with the undisputed reports of the forensic psychiatrists, and consistent with the joint approach of both the prosecution and Ms Evers, for the reasons I have already indicated, I find Mr Wyse not guilty on the grounds of mental illness on each of the fourteen counts on the indictment.


ORDERS


28Having found Mr Wyse not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, attention turned to the consequential orders that should be made. Under s 39(2) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act I am not to make an order releasing Mr Wyse from custody unless I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that his safety, as well as the safety of any member of the public, would not be seriously endangered by him being released.

29For reasons which I gave earlier, Mr Wyse's mental state has improved significantly since his arrest. His most recent risk assessment conducted, we believe, on 18 May 2011, indicates that a psychiatric nurse, Adrian Frances, notes that, ""Mr Wyse is compliant will all aspects of his treatment"". The only possible matter of concern could be his current delusional beliefs. Mr Frances records some distress concerning these court proceedings, and in particular he notes, ""Past twelve months no aggression of any type"".

30The report of Dr Bernardi notes: 

""Mr Wyse is currently on bail where he has been since 5 February 2009, and is being managed in the community whilst living with his mother.""

31There is no suggestion since Mr Wyse's release to bail he has caused any problems at all to the community, and so I have no hesitation at all in finding, on the balance of probabilities, that his safety, and the members of the public safety, will not be endangered seriously by his release, accordingly I make the following orders.

(1)That Timothy Wyse be conditionally released from the Court subject to the following conditions:

(a)That he attend the Mental Health Review Tribunal at Gladesville, or any other location as directed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, as required by that Tribunal.

(b)He live with his mother Anne Camden at (an address provided to the Court), or any other location as directed by the Tribunal.

(c)He be of good behaviour.

(d)He obey all directions of the Tribunal.

(e)He attend the North Sydney Local Health District Community Health Centre monthly, or as directed by them, or the Tribunal.

(f)He attend Dr Bernardi as required by her, or by the Tribunal.

(g)He take all medication prescribed by Dr Bernardi, her delegate, or any person appointed by the Tribunal.



(2)The Registrar of this Court is to notify the Minister for Health, and the Tribunal of the terms of this order.

2708869,R v Jon Stephen McKENZIE [2011] NSWSC 1460,"Judgment  1The offender, Jon Stephen McKenzie, stands for sentence for the murder of his wife, Rhonda Mary Anne McKenzie.  He was arrested on 3 November 2010 at his home, where he was found with his wife's body.  He admitted his offence and later pleaded guilty to the charge in the Grafton Local Court.  2The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is life imprisonment. Section 61 (1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ('the Act') requires that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.  The Crown did not seek the imposition of such a sentence in this case.  3The Parliament has also imposed a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment under s 54A of the Act for an offence of murder falling in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences.  A non-parole period is the minimum period that an offender will serve in prison for the offence, before being released on parole for the balance of the sentence. Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are factors which must be taken into account on sentencing, even in the case of a plea, in the way recently discussed in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 85 ALJR 1154.  4Also to be taken into account is s 44(2) of the Act, which specifies that ""[t]he balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more"". If there is to be any adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628).  The Evidence  5The parties agreed on the facts.  Also tendered were two documents handwritten by the offender; a report by Dr Stephen Allnut, a psychiatrist who had examined the offender; and the offender's criminal record.  The offender did not give evidence, but his instructions to his counsel were that he believed that he deserved to have the maximum penalty for the offence, life imprisonment, imposed upon him.  6The evidence showed that the offender has no prior criminal history of any kind.  The agreed facts included that:  -  The offender and his wife had three children, the youngest aged 16 years at the time of the offence.  None of them were, however, living with their parents, at their property at Lawrence, where the offence was committed.  - The offence was revealed soon after it was committed when the offender twice telephoned a family friend and asked him to come over, because he had ""done something terrible"".  -  The offender was found sitting in the garage, crying and rocking backwards and forwards, calling out that he had done something terrible.  He had black cables tied around both of his wrists and was later found to have small abrasions on his arm and foot.  He said things like:  ""I only wish I would do away with myself.  I couldn't even do that.  I'm worse than an animal.  I killed my wife.  What will the kids think of me.""  ""I killed Rhonda.  I'm an animal.  I killed Rhonda.  I couldn't even do away with myself.  I didn't have the guts to do it.  I killed the person I loved.""   -  The offender was arrested by police soon afterwards.  He told them that he had killed his wife using his hands.  Mrs McKenzie's body was found on a bed.  She had several areas of light blood staining over her arms and the front of the cardigan she was wearing.  -  In the study police found straps strapped around a bed and an open packet of black cable ties on the desk.  The offender's DNA was found on the straps.  -  There was a handwritten suicide note found in the study, which had words crossed out at the end and the following words written:  ""It's happened differently now, how cursed I am.  You can all curse me children I deserve it.  I don't know what's wrong with my mind to do what I did.  I hope your lives are happy, and remember your mother as the good lady she was.""  -  A post mortem examination of Mrs McKenzie's body established that the cause of death was smothering.  There were multiple abrasions and bruising around her cheeks, mouth and chin; multiple bruising to her head, neck and arms; several bruises on  her torso, right leg and left foot; a bruise on her left hip; as well as an abrasion on her lower back.  There were multiple internal abrasions in her mouth.  Her injuries were consistent with attempts at restraint by another person and external pressure when her lips were forcibly pressed against her teeth.  Mrs McKenzie had a blood alcohol reading.  - The offender later gave an account of what had occurred to a friend, while crying.  He showed a lot of remorse and appeared genuine.  -  Police enquiries of friends, neighbours and relatives elicited many comments that the offender seemed depressed and that his depression had worsened in the weeks leading up to the offence.  -  Police had received no prior reports of domestic violence between the offender and his wife.  7In his report, Dr Allnut recounted that he examined the offender, who had suffered from arthritis which had led to depression and ultimately retirement from work, four to five years before the offence.  The offender and his wife had been married for 22 or 23 years, but had separated for six months some years before the offence, as the result of the effects of the depression he was then suffering.  They later resumed their relationship, which was normal, and while there had been occasional arguments, there was no domestic violence or aggression.  8Over time the offender's arthritis deteriorated and he began receiving medication by intravenous injection.  In the period leading up to the offence, the offender's arthritis worsened, as did the offender's mood. While he had never abused alcohol or taken drugs, he increased his alcohol consumption.  Eventually, he  developed suicidal thoughts and began contemplating ways of ending his life.  Thoughts of feeling worthless became overwhelming, his grooming deteriorated, he began missing meals, had trouble socialising and his relationship with his wife also deteriorated, although there were no particular arguments or resentments.  His wife urged the offender to return to the doctor about his arthritis, but he could not be bothered.  9The offender reached the point where he decided on a means of suicide.  He wrote a suicide note to explain his decision to his wife and children and purchased materials to assist him in that suicide.  10The day of the offence was not out of the ordinary.  The offender had reduced his alcohol consumption and drank only four beers that afternoon.  He fixed a problem with the car and while his memory of the immediate lead up to the offence was patchy, he remembered having an argument with his wife, but not its cause.  It was not violent.  He recalled raised voices, taking four or five steps towards his wife in the kitchen, putting a hand up her back and over her nose and mouth for some time, her hitting him and then slumping to the ground.  He knelt beside her and realised that she was dead.  The offender could not recall what he was thinking or feeling at the time.  It did not occur to him to do CPR.  11The offender recalled that he began to cry, he felt sorry for his wife and struggled to carry her to bed, where he covered her.  He intended then to take his own life and went to the den, where he tried, but failed to commit suicide.  He then called a friend, who came to him and called the police.  12Since his arrest the offender had received treatment, with the result that his mood had improved, although feelings of worthlessness persisted, as did problems with his arthritis.  He felt remorse for what he had done to his wife and children.  He was not interested in pursuing any mental illness defence, because he felt that he deserved to go to prison and did not wish any delay.  13Dr Allnut noted information obtained from a friend who had known the offender and his wife for over 20 years, who had noticed that the offender was depressed for some time and that this had worsened in the few months before the offence.  Dr Allnut also noted information obtained from the offender's children.  His daughter said that their parents had separated in 2002 or 2003, after their father developed arthritis, but they had got back together before his retirement in 2005.  While everything was good for a while, things deteriorated and they saw a marriage counsellor.  While the offender never used to drink, he began drinking in 2003 or 2004 and this got progressively worse.  One of his sons said that his mother also increased her alcohol consumption.  Their relationship deteriorated and he left home.  The offender was depressed and spoke about suicide.  His other son gave a similar account.   Dr Allnut also referred to information obtained from a number of other sources, who corroborated these accounts.  14Dr Allnut's opinion was that:  -   The offender's history was consistent with an earlier depressive condition for which he was treated and from which he recovered.  Increased interpersonal conflict with his wife and to some degree his children, later saw further depressive symptoms emerge.  At the time of the offence those symptoms were consistent with the existence of a depressive disorder.  There were reasonable grounds for thinking that the offender was then experiencing a disease of the mind, as well as an underlying condition causing an abnormality of the mind.  - There was an absence of significant evidence of impulsive aggression to his wife or others, other than a degree of verbal abuse and no account of prior planning.  At the time of the offence the offender described an argument and behaviours which caused his wife's death.  -  It was unlikely that the offender's depressive mood would have been of a nature or severity that would have significantly impaired his capacity to form intent.  -  His mental state was not of such a nature and severity that it would have impacted on his capacity to understand or know the nature and quality of his actions and he would have maintained the capacity to understand that his behaviour could have resulted in harm to his wife.  -  There was no evidence of any perceptual disturbance or delusional beliefs at the time of the offence.  - The offender's depressive disorder would not have been of a nature and severity that it would have impacted to the extent that:  he was unable to appreciate or realise the consequences of his actions;  it would have impaired his capacity to know what was happening, or to be aware that he was harming his wife;  he was incapable of reasoning with a moderate degree of sense and composure about whether the contact was wrong.  - The offender's comments and behaviours immediately after the offence showed that he clearly understood what he was doing.  He expressed emotions and thoughts consistent with an understanding that his behaviour was wrong.  One could reasonably assume that his depressive symptoms immediately after the offence were similar to those present at the time of the offence.  -  The offender had no defence of mental illness, even though he suffered a disease of the mind.  It did not cause a defect of reason and was not of a nature or severity to impair his capacity to understand the nature and quality of his acts or their wrongfulness, causing him not to be capable of reasoning with a moderate degree of sense and composure about whether his conduct was wrong, as perceived by reasonable people.  -  The offender's depressive disorder was not of a nature and severity that it impaired his capacity to understand or judge right from wrong.  His comments immediately afterwards were consistent with a knowledge of wrongfulness.  -  It is not uncommon for individuals with depressive disorders to experience increased levels of irritability and, as a consequence, to be more vulnerable to reacting impulsively in an aggressive manner.  There was a suggestion that on previous occasions when depressed, the quality of the offender's relationship with his wife had deteriorated.  It was feasible to consider that immediately preceding the offence, the offender had engaged in some form of altercation with his wife and had reacted in response, with the depression contributing to an impulsive, aggressive response.  -  The offender was remorseful for his actions.  15The offender's handwritten documents, one a suicide note and the other written some time after the offence, support these opinions.  The words written immediately after the offence, which I have quoted in part, reveal the offender's understanding at the time of the offence of what he had done, that it was wrong, and that he was remorseful.  That is consistent with the evidence of the other steps which he soon took to reveal the offence and with what he then said to the friend who responded to his call for assistance.  The later account which the offender wrote, explained his ongoing problems with arthritis, the pain he was suffering, the feelings of depression which resulted and their consequences for his day to day life and his relationship with his wife.  16The evidence shows that the offender does not seek to excuse his behaviour, which he finds impossible to explain, but it also reveals that he does have somewhat limited insight into the events which caused his wife's death.  On the one hand he wrote in his later explanation that there was 'not a violent argument, raised voices but no violence'.  He gave Dr Allnut a similar account.  On the other hand he described a violent struggle, after approaching his wife from behind and then covering her nose and mouth with his hands.  During their struggle Mrs McKenzie hit him four or five times on the shoulder, the side of the head, the forehead and the right ear and they then fell to the ground together, where he lay beside her crying with remorse, before he felt for her pulse.  He believed that she was dead.  He then carried her to bed, before attempting to end his own life.  The offender said that he took this step because he was 'so shocked I was capable of what I did'.  He then wrote an additional paragraph to the suicide note he had earlier prepared, which I have already quoted and unsuccessfully attempted to take his life, before calling for help.  The parties' cases  17The only issue lying between the parties was whether the evidence established that the offence fell at the lowest end of the range of such offences, that being the case advanced for the offender, or only towards the bottom of that range, that being the Crown's case.  The Court's sentencing task  18The Parliament requires that the sentence imposed on the offender be determined having in mind the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Act. Those purposes are:  ""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,  (b)  to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,  (c)  to protect the community from the offender,  (d)  to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,  (e)  to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,  (f)  to denounce the conduct of the offender,  (g)  to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""  19The sentence imposed must reflect the gravity of this offence, viewed objectively (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354).   The offender's guilty plea must be taken into account (s 22).  Section 21A also requires that in determining that sentence, consideration be given to specified aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence, as well as any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence.  The sentence must also ensure that there is a reasonable proportionality between the sentence imposed and the circumstances of the crime committed (see R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]). Consideration must also be given to general and specific deterrence in the sentence imposed.  The seriousness of the offence  20The offender smothered his wife using his hands, while she struggled with him for her life.  That this was a violent offence cannot be doubted.  On the case advanced on his behalf, notwithstanding the offender's instructions that the maximum penalty should be imposed upon him, such a sentence could not be imposed, given the Court's obligation to assess the objective seriousness of the offence on the evidence, as well as taking into account what the evidence revealed about the offender's subjective circumstances.  The Crown's submission was also that this was not a case where the maximum penalty could be imposed.  I am satisfied that those submissions must be accepted.  The task imposed upon the Court by the Parliament does not leave open the conclusion that the sentence which the offender sought, could be imposed upon him.  21The maximum sentence is reserved for extreme offences of the kind described in s 61, to which I have already referred.  As discussed in R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448 at [60]:  ""Because the life sentence provided by s.61 of that Act does not contemplate any prospect of relief in the future, no matter how distant, it should be reserved for crimes of the utmost heinousness: Chung [1999] NSWCCA 330, Ibbs v. R. (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-2, Twala NSWCCA 4/11/94, Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 553 at pars.344-4, Harris at 423.""  22Given the evidence as to the objective and subjective matters which must be taken into account in sentencing this offender, I am satisfied that it cannot be concluded that this is such a case.  23I am not, however, able to accept that objectively, this offence falls at the very bottom of the range of such offences, given the evidence that Mrs McKenzie's death followed a struggle with the offender in which she vigorously defended herself from his violent attack.  While the struggle may have been of a relatively short duration, even in his own handwritten documents the offender described it as one in which Mrs McKenzie repeatedly hit him, as she fought for her life, as he was suffocating her with his hands placed over her mouth and nose, while standing behind her.  Given the evidence as to the injuries which Mrs McKenzie sustained in that struggle, it is apparent that this was not an easy or painless death, but one which she fought against valiantly, albeit unsuccessfully, while the offender used considerable force to achieve his aim.  24The evidence did establish that this was not a mid-range offence.  It was not premeditated. The offender had previously determined to end his own life. He was suffering from depression, a mental illness which was the result of an ongoing, painful and debilitating physical condition.  Both illnesses worsened in the period immediately before the offence.  On the evidence while his mental condition did not deprive the offender of the ability to understand the consequences of his actions, it did leave him vulnerable to reacting impulsively and aggressively.  The Crown properly accepted that this abnormality of mind reduced the offender's moral culpability for his offence (see R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346).  The evidence does not leave open to doubt, however, that the offender acted with an intent to kill Mrs McKenzie, rather than with an intent only to cause her grievous bodily harm, or that he acted with merely reckless indifference to human life.  This must be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of the offence.  25As the Crown accepted, while the evidence suggests that the offender's intention to kill was one which existed only for a short period of time and was immediately regretted once achieved, it nevertheless persisted for a sufficiently long period to enable the offender to succeed in achieving his end, despite Mrs McKenzie's struggle for her life.  There is no suggestion that Mrs McKenzie provoked his attack.  Despite being  affected by alcohol, her various injuries showed how she tried unsuccessfully to defend herself, as the Crown submitted, from a senseless, prolonged and merciless assault.  The result was that the offender deprived his wife, the woman he says he loved, of her life and their children of their mother.  That is relevant to note, because, as discussed in R v Lewis:  ""67  ... in my opinion the degree of harm which the offender knows will be caused by the offence is highly relevant to the culpability of the offender. In this case, quite plainly the applicant knew that the death of Ms. Pang would deprive five children of their mother, and prima facie that is serious harm, in addition to the death of Ms. Pang, which the applicant knew would be caused by his offence. This is not to say that the crime is more serious because Ms. Pang was in some way more worthy than other possible victims, merely to recognise the harm caused to children by the loss of their mother; and to recognise that where the offender knows that this harm will be caused, that can be relevant to the offender's culpability. In my opinion, the sentencing judge made no error in this respect.""  26That this was a most serious offence, cannot be doubted.  Aggravating factors  27The various aggravating factors specified in s 21A do not arise for separate consideration in this case.  Mitigating factors  28On the evidence, the parties' agreement that the following mitigating matters specified in s 21A are relevant to take into account must be accepted.  They are:  ""(b)   the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity,  ...  (e)   the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions,  (f)   the offender was a person of good character,  (g)   the offender is unlikely to re-offend,  (h)   the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise,  (i)   the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:  (i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and  (ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)""  29The evidence does not leave any doubt that the offender has accepted responsibility for his unpremeditated actions.  He has repeatedly expressed his distress and remorse at what he has done to his wife and children.  This awful offence was entirely inconsistent with his prior good character.  Regrettably it was his first offence, committed when aged 64 years.  That he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend, is also apparent.  He has responded to the treatment he has received for his mental condition, the result of the effects of a debilitating physical illness.  That condition played an obvious contributing role in this offence.  Age  30It was also common ground that some account must be taken of the offender's age,  a matter not separately specified in s 21A.  Such a consideration arises particularly where the circumstances are such that an offender may spend the whole of his remaining life in custody.  In R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 it was observed, for example, at 507-08:  ""I would not accept, however, that any of those considerations is irrelevant when sentencing a person of advanced age who, albeit generally in good health, has a statistically short expectation of life. Of course, account must be taken of how much more onerous it will be for him to serve a gaol sentence than it would be if he were younger. That is material to the appropriate length of the full-time custody. It does not make proportionality irrelevant. Likewise, the effect of the sentence upon general deterrence is not irrelevant. What, however, is appropriate by way of full-time custody, viewed from the point of view of general deterrence, must be considered in the light of the impact upon public perception of a gaol sentence imposed upon a man of such advanced years upon whom the sentence would bear the more heavily because of his very age and the real risk that he will never walk free. ... ""  31Accordingly, I accept the offender's age and its consequences are factors to be taken into account in determining sentence.  Discount on Sentence  32It was also common ground that it is within my discretion to grant the offender a discount of 25%, for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, in accordance with the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  33I also accept those submissions.  T he offender immediately confessed his guilt when he summoned help; he entered his plea in the Local Court and adhered to his plea in this Court. The purpose of such a utilitarian discount is, as explained by the Chief Justice, namely, that it reflects the benefits which flow from a guilty plea for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole, as well as to witnesses, especially victims, who, as the result of such a plea, are spared having to give evidence and the personal rumination of traumatic events, which is inevitably involved in that process. These benefits must be identified by a trial judge when sentencing, in order to provide an incentive to offenders to enter such a plea, so that such benefits will, in fact, be derived (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [115] - [123]).  34In this case I am satisfied that given the offender's early plea, he must have a discount of 25% on this account.  Standard non-parole period and comparable cases  35As I have observed, the standard non-parole period of 20 years for a mid-range offence is one of the factors which must be taken into consideration in determining the sentence to be imposed, in accordance with the approach discussed by the High Court in R v Muldrock .  For reasons which I have explained, the standard non-parole period is not the appropriate sentence for this offence.  The parties referred to a range of cases in submissions.  I found most of them to be of relatively limited assistance, given the very significantly different factual circumstances involved in those cases.  36The parties were agreed, however, that some assistance might be found in the judgment given in R v Kiseljev [2004] NSWSC 1030, where the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 16 years, with a non-parole period of 11 years after a plea of guilty.  That offence was committed by a 64 year old man, who had murdered his 22 year old wife, in an unpremeditated violent attack, which resulted in the victim sustaining multiple, extensive injuries. The cause of death was asphyxia and blunt trauma to the head and trunk, the result of an angry response to the actions of the deceased, which were found to have involved a degree of provocative conduct.  The accused had no prior criminal history and was found to be suffering from depression and a moderate to severe adjustment disorder, due mainly to the fact that he was facing the charge.  He was otherwise a person of good character, who had shown remorse and entered a plea, for which he received a 20% discount.  37It must be accepted that this offence bore some similarities to that dealt with in R v Kiseljev , but equally, there were various significant differences.  For example, there was here pre-existing illness, no explanation for the offender's attack, and no suggestion of any provocation, but there were also less serious injuries done to Mrs McKenzie, prior to her death.  It follows that while this judgment was of some assistance, in the end result the sentence imposed in this case must be determined in the light of its own facts.  Special circumstances  38In this case, I am also of the view that there should be a finding of special circumstances warranting a small reduction in the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period.  This reflects that this is the first offence which this now 65 year old man has committed; that he is serving his first time in custody; and that he is unlikely to offend again, given the contribution played by his depressive illness, for which he is being successfully treated.  In the result I am satisfied that this reduction in the usual statutory ratio will ensure an appropriate period of supervision of the offender on parole, after release and that the period of imprisonment imposed will still sufficiently reflect necessary considerations of deterrence and retribution in the sentence imposed.  Victim Impact Statement  39From what I have said about the facts, it will readily be apparent that the circumstances of this offence are of a most tragic kind.  A victim impact statement was received from the offender's daughter, Alicia McKenzie.  There she spoke eloquently of her mother and her life and the ongoing painful impact which her untimely, awful death has had on her and her two younger brothers.  It is not possible for me to convey the depths of the feelings and emotions which Ms McKenzie described.  These proceedings cannot make good the senseless loss of a devoted mother, or what Mrs McKenzie's children have each suffered as a result.   Nevertheless, the Court can extend its deepest sympathy to them and express its hope that when these proceedings are over, they may be given some peace of mind by an understanding of what the evidence has revealed about how that loss came about and how our society has dealt with their mother's death and their father's offence.  40In making these comments, I note that the law as to the receipt of victim impact statements is well settled and that I have adhered to that approach in receiving the statement provided in this case. In R v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274, five members of the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the approach established in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76, which has since been followed. They concluded that approach must be adhered to. That means that an unsworn, untested victim impact statement may not be taken into account in sentencing the offender, for reasons which were explained at length by Hunt CJ at CL in 1997 and which I will not deal with further, in this case .  Conviction and sentence  41Having considered all of the matters I have mentioned, I have concluded that but for the utilitarian value of the offender's plea, I would have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment of 19 years.  With discount, the sentence is 14 years, 3 months.  I will fix a non-parole period of 10 years.  42Account must also be taken of the fact that the offender has been in continuous custody since 3 November 2010.  In this case it is appropriate to commence the sentence imposed on the offender from that date.  43Jon Stephen McKenzie I convict you of the murder of Rhonda Mary Anne McKenzie .  44You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of  10 years, commencing on 3 November 2010 and expiring on 2 November 2020.  I set a balance of term of  4 years, 3 months, which is to commence on 3 November 2020 and to expire on 2 February 2025.  You will be eligible for release on parole on 2 November 2020.  **********

		30 November 2011",2011-11-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708895,Justin Smith v R [2011] NSWCCA 290,"Judgment 

1BLANCH J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed at Albury District Court on 12 March 2010. He entered a plea of guilty to an offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s52A(2) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years. He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years from 19 September 2009, which was the date he went into custody. 

The Facts 

2The facts presented to the Court were that at about 10.30 p.m. on Friday, 18 September 2009 the applicant was driving his Ford utility vehicle south on David Street, Albury at a speed of between 80 and 100 kilometres per hour in a 60 kilometre per hour zone. The vehicle went through a red traffic light and shortly after was observed on its roof in a culvert nearby. The evidence indicated he was attempting to negotiate a left hand bend where there was an indicative speed sign of 35 kilometres per hour. Based on the physical evidence at the scene, the vehicle was estimated to be travelling at a minimum speed of 92 kilometres per hour prior to it leaving the sealed road. It crossed to the incorrect side of the road and collided with a concrete kerb. The vehicle continued until it collided with a concrete box culvert and rolled over coming to rest on its roof. The applicant was trapped inside the driver's side of the vehicle. Amanda Bowen, the applicant's girlfriend, was trapped in the passenger side of the vehicle with her seat belt still fastened and she died at the scene as a result of massive head injuries. As a result of the collision the vehicle was destroyed. 

3The applicant was freed from the vehicle and said words to the effect of ""I just killed my girlfriend. I've killed the only girl I've ever loved."" He was observed to be aggressive, unsteady on his feet and smelled strongly of intoxicating liquor. He was arrested and a blood sample was taken which revealed a reading of 0.188 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres. 

4The applicant was born in 1979 and has a criminal history which began in the Children's Court in 1997. In 1999 he was fined and disqualified for nine months for mid range PCA. In 2000 he was fined and disqualified for low range PCA. In 2002 he was ordered to serve community service for driving with mid range PCA and disqualified. In 2005 he was convicted of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm for which he was ultimately sentenced to three months periodic detention. In 2007 he was fined and disqualified for an offence of driving while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. At the time of the offence his Victorian driver's licence was disqualified or suspended. 

The grounds of appeal 

5The first ground of appeal is that ""his Honour erred in not applying the principles of sentencing outlined in Hughes v R (2008) 185 A Crim R 155 in relation to the death of an intimate."" 

6In that case Grove J said: 
""Of course leniency does not derive from the mere fact that the deceased was not a stranger ...but from the consequential quality and depth of the remorse and shock."" 

7The sentencing judge said: 
""I will allow some consideration for his contrition and remorse based on his sorrow over the death of the victim. But it can only be a relatively minor factor on sentence."" 

8It is clear then that his Honour did make some allowance for contrition and remorse based on the death of the victim. He assessed that as minor relative to the other factors he had to bear in mind in imposing the sentence. The authorities do not specify how much consideration should be given to such a factor and I do not believe any error has been demonstrated in his Honour's assessment. 

9The second ground of appeal is ""his Honour erred in finding that the applicant's remorse over the death of the victim, his partner, was 'only a relatively minor factor on sentence'."" This ground of appeal replicates the first ground of appeal. 

10The third ground of appeal is that his Honour ""erred in finding an aggravating factor of the ignoring of warnings."" The point raised is that the warnings relied upon by the judge are not of a type previously held to be warnings in these cases. The first warning relied on by the judge was the red light which the applicant drove through well in excess of the 60 kilometres per hour speed limit. This was within a very short distance of the accident itself and must have been an indicator to the applicant he was driving too fast. The second warning relied on by the judge was the advisory speed notice indicating 35 kilometres per hour as the appropriate speed to negotiate the left hand bend. By driving at 92 kilometres per hour around that bend, he was clearly ignoring the advisory warning and I see no error in the judge regarding the advisory speed sign as a warning. I note also that in Preston v R [2011] NSWCCA 25 the Court regarded road signs and markings as warnings. 

11The fourth ground of appeal is ""his Honour erred in finding an aggravating factor of competitive driving."" That ground is abandoned for good reason because in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at p286 Spigelman CJ set out a list of aggravating factors established by the authorities and they included ""competitive driving or showing off"" and the applicant here said he was showing off. 

12The fifth ground of appeal is ""the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive"". In R v Whyte (supra) the Court of Criminal Appeal set out in its judgment a guideline for sentencing for an offence of dangerous driving causing death or bodily harm contrary to s52A(1). That guideline said that ""... where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full-time custodial sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) ... would not generally be appropriate."" The Court went on to say that in the case of an aggravated version of the offence ""... an appropriate encouragement to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required."" The sentence imposed in this case was significantly higher than that specified in the guideline judgment. The typical case referred to in that case to warrant such a sentence was said to be where there was: 
i. Extent and nature of injuries inflicted. 

ii. Number of people put at risk. 

iii. Degree of speed. 

iv. Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. 

v. Erratic or aggressive driving. 

vi. Competitive driving or showing-off. 

vii. Length of journey during which others were exposed to risk. 

viii. Ignoring of warnings. 

ix. Escaping police pursuit. 

x. Degree of sleep deprivation. 

xi. Failing to stop. 

13In this case the applicant was 30 years of age and not of good character and those factors tell significantly against the applicant. On the other hand the victim was not a stranger, the applicant did express remorse and the plea of guilty was at an early stage. Those factors are in his favour. The aggravating factors identified by the Court there which exist in this case are the degree of speed, the degree of intoxication, the aggressive driving, the showing off and the ignoring of the red light and the advisory speed limit. The decision also emphasised that in arriving at a sentence in a particular case, a judge will exercise a broad discretion taking into account all relevant factors. Here the applicant has submitted a table of cases where an offender has been sentenced for aggravated dangerous driving. That list includes 16 cases between 2003 and 2010 and no case involves a sentence as long as this sentence for a single count under s52A(2). 

14The sentencing statistics from the Judicial Commission indicate that for the period from July 2002 to June 2009 for an offence against s52A(2) only seven percent of offenders (represented by four cases) were sentenced to a sentence as high as eight years imprisonment. In only two percent of cases (representing one offender) a non-parole period as high as five years was imposed. These statistics do not specify the number of counts in each case. 

15The applicant has also submitted a table of sentences in manslaughter cases involving the driving of a motor vehicle. That review indicates that in only three of ten cases did an offender receive a sentence involving a non-parole period of six years or greater. 

16The difficulty with statistics and attempts to compare cases is that the matters to be considered in each case are so variable. Justice Rothman in R v Vaeila [2010] NSWCCA 113 said: 
""Statistics are a guide to the range that have been imposed; those statistics do not define the range available to a sentencing judge. That range is defined by the maximum sentence and the gravity of the offence."" 

17The High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 has reaffirmed the sentencing principle stated by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen (2006) 228 CLR 357 at 378: 
""The judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case."" 

18The High Court went on to deprecate a two-stage approach to sentencing in the context of Division 1A offences (those involving standard non-parole periods). However, as Spigelman CJ pointed out in R v Whyte (supra at pages 277-278) the use of a guideline judgment does not necessarily introduce a two-stage approach to sentencing - it is simply a guide in the ultimate exercise of the application of an instinctive synthesis approach. 

19In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Markarian (supra) at page 371 it was said: 
""And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies."" 

20It is in the context of the principle of consistency of approach that an analysis of past decisions is useful. In the case of Bombadieri v The Queen (2010) 203 A Crim R 89 Justice Buddin referred to a list of ten cases referred to by Justice Grove in R v Ryan (2003) 141 A Crim R 403. In that list of cases the heaviest sentences were in R v Woodward [2001] NSWCCA 90 where a sentence of eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years was imposed. There the offender was convicted after trial and the aggravating feature was a blood alcohol concentration of 0.216. In R v Cousins [2002] NSWCCA 81 after a successful Crown appeal a sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of six years was imposed. That sentence, however, was in respect of the death of two victims, one killed and one seriously injured. He was a disqualified driver and had a criminal history described as ""appalling"". 

21In the case of Bombadieri v The Queen (supra) Justice Buddin also looked at three cases where two deaths had been occasioned in each. In the case of Thompson v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 299 for the first offence a sentence of eight years with a five year non-parole period was imposed and for the second offence there was a cumulative sentence resulting in a total sentence of ten and a half years with a non-parole period of seven and a half years. Of the other cases referred to the head sentences were seven years, seven years and ten months and five years and four months. In the case of Bombadieri (supra) itself after a review of the cases this Court reduced a sentence of ten years with a non-parole period of six and a half years to a sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of five years and nine months. In that case the offender was 20 years of age. His driver's licence had been cancelled and he had a driving record including an offence of driving at a dangerous speed. The offender drove at speeds of 150 to 160 kilometres per hour. He was pursued by police and he drove in a reckless fashion for 190 kilometres causing the death of the victim who swerved to avoid his erratic driving. 

22In the case of Regina v Rayner [2002] NSWCCA 309 in a judgment delivered by me I also set out a list of five cases where the longest sentence was one of six years. 

23Having reviewed all of the cases it is apparent this sentence is the highest sentence imposed in respect of one count under s52A(2). In order to maintain a consistency of approach in sentencing for these offences, I believe the sentence should be reduced. On the other hand this is a case involving a serious abdication of responsibility and, taking into account the further subjective material tendered to this Court, a significant sentence is required. 

24Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 

(1)Grant leave to appeal. 

(2)Allow the appeal. 

(3)Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court and sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of five years and three months imprisonment from 19 September 2009 with a balance of term of 21 months. The total term is therefore one of seven years imprisonment with a five years and three months non-parole period and he will be eligible for release to parole on 18 December 2014. I would confirm the conviction on the charge of driving while unlicensed and I would confirm the order for disqualification from driving for a period of five years from 18 September 2015. 

25McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Justice Blanch. This is yet another of offences which this Court sees from time to time when persons who are heavily intoxicated drive a motor vehicle. As Justice Blanch has made plain, the decisions of this Court indicate that those who conduct themselves in that manner can expect a severe penalty. It is only the fact that the range of penalties that have previously been imposed indicate that this court should intervene in this particular case that I share in the decision which Justice Blanch has indicated he would make. 

26HISLOP J: I also agree with Justice Blanch. 

27McCLELLAN CJ at CL: the orders of the Court are accordingly those proposed by Justice Blanch.

2708902,Clark v State Parole Authority of New South Wales (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 1491,"judgment  1The applicant made an application under section 155(1)(b) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999.  He did so after his application for parole had been declined by the Parole Authority.  In the course of the application, it was submitted on his behalf that the Parole Authority had made its decision based on information which had been false, misleading or irrelevant.   2For reasons which I gave on 14 October 2011, I accepted his counsel's submission and said a case had been made out for relief and that a direction should be given to the Parole Authority under section 155(1)(b).  3I invited the parties to seek agreement on the form of the direction to be given and I stood the matter over until today so that that agreement could be reached.  4Today, I was informed by Ms Johnson for the respondent and Mr Segal for the applicant that the parties had reached agreement on the form of the direction to be given.  In a moment, I propose giving that direction.   5Mr Segal, however, informed me today that because of the success of the applicant, he sought an order for costs.   6I should say that when the matter was in the course of argument before me on 20 September 2011, Ms Johnson informed me that on the assumption that the application failed, the Attorney General would not apply for an order for costs.  I took her to say that that represented the Attorney General's policy in these matters.   7Mr Segal, however, submitted to me that as I am exercising jurisdiction in the Common Law Division of this Court, there is a general principle that costs should follow the event; the event here is his client's success in persuading me to make a relevant direction, and, accordingly, the order should be given.   8He told me that his client had not been the recipient of a legal aid grant, but that his fees had been paid by him or his family.   9I consider that I should refuse the application.  This is an application in the criminal jurisdiction of the court. Traditionally costs in criminal cases are not awarded in the absence of some statutory power to authorise such an order: Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 557 (per Dawson J).   10Mr Segal was not able to draw my attention to any statutory warrant for my making an order of the kind he sought.  He conceded that the matter has been considered previously by the Court of Criminal Appeal and that decision, LMS v Parole Board [1999] NSWCCA 371; (1999) 110 A Crim R 172, does not assist him.   11In LMS v Parole Board , the facts were not dissimilar from those here, in the sense that the applicant succeeded in persuading the Court to direct the Parole Board that certain information on which its decision had been based was misleading.  At the conclusion of those proceedings the successful applicant sought an order for costs.  At paragraph 24 the Court, consisting of Stein JA, Hulme and James JJ, said:  ""The applicant sought certain costs.  That application is entirely misconceived and this Court lacks power to grant any such application.""   12Mr Segal submitted to me that since LMS was decided, the legislation which was there being considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal, has been amended.  Their Honours in LMS were considering merely the precursor to the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. Thus, he put to me, I am not bound by what the Court of Criminal Appeal decided in LMS.   13However, the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act , as I took him to concede and as Ms Johnson put to me, is in almost identical terms to that which was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in LMS . I consider I must follow LMS . Further, Mr Segal could not draw my attention to any part of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act which contains any provision giving me power to make a costs order of any type, let alone that which he seeks here.   14Accordingly, I am not persuaded that I have the power to award costs and I consider that I must refuse the application.   15So I refuse the application for costs.   16The order that I make is that which has been agreed by the parties, namely this:  ""I make an order directing the State Parole Authority, under section 155 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) that, in so far as paragraph 7 of the Serious Offenders Review Council report dated 14 December 2010 suggested that the applicant had refused to participate in any therapeutic programs post-release, that paragraph was misleading, as it did not take into account that the applicant had agreed to undertake the CALM program in the community, and to wear an anklet, and to see a psychologist post-release.""   17I will initial and date the consent order and place it in the file.  **********

2708916,R v Fox [2011] NSWDC 250,"SENTENCE

1 HIS HONOUR: Mitchell Bruce Fox appears for sentence in respect of seven offences, each involving prohibited sexual activity contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (the ""Act""), with one of three male child victims on six separate occasions occurring within the period from 31 December 1979 to 1 January 1985 at various locations within the Sydney metropolitan area.

2 When sentencing in respect of three of the offences, Counts 4, 5 and 6, the Court is asked to take into consideration pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 a further offence contained on a separate Form 1. 

3 The offender accessed each of the three male child victims by arrangement with associates who were paedophile procurers or pimps who had targeted young, vulnerable individuals and groomed them to the extent that they were each habituated to and compliant with sexual activity with adult males such as the offender. They were provided to the offender at his private residences at Bellevue Hill and Collaroy or on ""Skipper-A-Clipper"" cruisers, with or without payment to the child or the procurer. 

4 During the five-year period during which the offender committed the offences, he was a successful businessman of thirty-six to forty-one years of age. The offending conduct commenced shortly after the conclusion of an eight-year homosexual partnership and concluded either shortly before or shortly after the offender entered into a heterosexual marriage.

5 There is no evidence that the offender has ever engaged in any similar offending conduct either before or after the five-year period referred to.

THE OFFENCES 

6Counts 1 and 2 - Buggery contrary to s 79 of the Act - relating to the victim PH, who was thirteen to fifteen years of age in the period relating to Count 1, and twelve to fifteen years of age in the period relating to Count 2. [The maximum penalty at the time for Buggery was fourteen years penal servitude.]

Counts 3 and 4 - Buggery contrary to s 79 of the Act - relating to the victim SM, who was ten years of age in the period relating to Count 3 and eleven years of age in the period relating to Count 4. (Form 1 - a further offence of Indecent Assault contrary to s 81 of the Act is to be taken into account when sentencing for Count 4. SM was then twelve years of age.) [The maximum penalty at the time for Buggery was fourteen years penal servitude and for Indecent Assault it was five years penal servitude.]

Counts 5, 6 and 7 relate to the victim AS.

Count 5 - Assault and Commit an Act of Indecency upon AS, then being under the age of sixteen, namely the age of nine to twelve, contrary to s 61E(1) of the Act. (Form 1 - a further offence contrary to s 61E(1) of the Act is to be taken into account when sentencing for Count 5. AS was nine to twelve years of age at the time of this offence.) [The maximum penalty at the time for Assault and Commit an Act of Indecency was six years penal servitude.]

Count 6 - Incite AS, then being under the age of sixteen, namely the age of nine to twelve, to an Act of Indecency with himself contrary to s 61E(2) of the Act. (Form 1 - a further offence contrary to s 61E(2) is to be taken into account when sentencing for Count 6. AS was nine to twelve years of age at the time of this offence.) [The maximum penalty at the time for Incite to an Act of Indecency was two years imprisonment.]

Count 7 - Indecent Assault on AS contrary to s 81 of the Act. AS was nine to eleven years of age in the period relating to Count 7. The maximum penalty at the time for Indecent Assault was five years penal servitude.]

BACKGROUND AND THE DISCOUNT FOR UTILITY

7 The offender was arrested and charged with thirty-one offences relating to the three victims on 22 June 2010. On that date the presiding Magistrate at the Hornsby Local Court granted bail and made orders for service of the brief and for the matter to be transferred to the Downing Centre Local Court on 10 August 2010.

8 At the Downing Centre on 10 August 2010, orders were made pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 (""Conferencing Act"") that the Crown serve a pre-trial disclosure certificate on or before 7 September 2010 and any outstanding statements on or before 21 September 2010. The parties were ordered to participate in a compulsory conference on or before 21 September 2010. The matter was adjourned to 28 September 2010 for plea or committal.

9 The Crown did not serve a pre-trial disclosure certificate and consequently no compulsory conference was held.

10 When the matter returned to court on 28 September 2010, a Crown application for a further month to comply with the orders was rejected. The parties by consent sought orders waiving the committal and for the offender to be committed to the District Court for trial. Such orders were made. It appears implicit in this sequence of events that the presiding Magistrate must have determined, whether explicitly referred to or not, that the compulsory conference required by s 6(1) of the Conferencing Act need not be held as provided by s 6(5). Accordingly, no compulsory conference was ever held and no compulsory conferencing certificate pursuant to s 12 of the Conferencing Act could issue.

11 The matter first came before the District Court on 8 October 2010. Orders were made, inter alia, that the Crown present an indictment on or before 26 November 2010, and the matter was listed for arraignment on that date. Prior to that date the Crown served a number of additional statements taken post committal, which included a lengthy statement from John Shiel, a very significant witness, as will be seen from the agreed facts. The matter was listed for trial on 7 March 2011 with a three-week estimate.

12 On 26 November 2010, the Crown was not then able to present an indictment and the Court made orders inter alia that it do so by 10 December 2010 and serve notice of the prosecution case on or before 17 December 2010. The trial date was confirmed and a pre-trial conference directed on or before 28 January 2011, with the matter listed for mention on that date.

13 The offender's legal representatives had the matter restored to the list on 17 December 2010 due to further non-compliance by the Crown with orders. A further order was made that the indictment be served on or before 21 December 2010. An indictment dated 20 December 2010 was filed and served by 21 December 2010, containing twenty-one counts, being a reduction of ten from the original offences subject to the committal. This resolution involved a number of the original charges (twenty-five) being ""no billed"", and a number of fresh ""ex officio"" charges (fifteen) being included. 

14 The indictment also contained variations of the particulars of offences in respect of which the offender had been committed for trial and which were included on the indictment. These variations related to dates and or the location particularized. In respect of dates, some were minor variations as to the commencement or end of the period in which the offences were alleged to have occurred, and some were substantial. For example, in respect of Count 1 on the final indictment, the period alleged changed from 1 March 1979/30 August 1979 to 31 July 1981/24 July 1983. In respect of changes of location as particularized, examples are: Collaroy changed to Sydney, Sydney changed to Bellevue Hill or Vaucluse changed to Bellevue Hill. In respect of the change from Vaucluse to Bellevue Hill, the change was made because it was initially understood that some offences occurred at the offender's residence, believed to be located in Vaucluse, but later established that his residence was in fact located in Bellevue Hill. At all times the facts referred to his residence with a description of it that meant that the offender could not have been misled by the reference to Vaucluse. 

15 The victims remained the same. All of the seven counts on the current indictment and the attached Form 1 offences were included on the indictment of 20 December 2010. 

16 On 3 February 2011 the Crown sought to vacate the trial date to ensure that John Shiel had been sentenced before being called in the prosecution case. The application was opposed and the motion to vacate the trial date refused. The offender was then arraigned on the indictment of 20 December 2010 and entered not guilty pleas to all twenty-one counts.

17 On 16 February 2011 the Crown finally served the notice of the prosecution case, having failed to comply with two earlier orders to do so on prior dates.

18 Two further statements of AS, dated 16 and 25 February 2011, and John Shiel, dated 8 March 2011, were later served.

19 The written submissions on behalf of the offender in respect of the utility discount and the progress of the matter include the following:

""2.37 Mr Fox, at all times, has been ready, willing and able to participate in the Case Conferencing regime. His inability to do so lies squarely at the feet of the Crown, who despite being required to act as a model litigant breached numerous orders of the court, ignored practice notes and statutory provisions. 

2.38 To now seek to penalise Mr Fox for giving his plea of guilty at a time after committal, and on 7 counts (with 3 on a Form 1) from the original indictment as finally filed on 20 December 2010 (that contained 21 counts) when the Crown, by reason of its persistent breaches of the orders of the Court, the practice notes and section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Act prevented the case conferencing process, would work a serious injustice that will not withstand judicial scrutiny.""

20 The failure to comply with any orders of the Local or District Courts of New South Wales or otherwise conform to practice and any resultant delay in the progress of the matter are relevant to the question of the appropriate discount for utility. Whether the cause is incompetence, dilatory application, institutional dysfunction, lack of resources or the recognized difficulty of obtaining coherent and reliable information from adult complainants, let alone children, in respect of alleged offences occurring decades in the past, such conduct remains relevant. 

21 The matter was listed for trial commencing 7 March 2011. It came before me on 8 March 2011 for trial. The indictment contained the twenty-one counts to which the offender had pleaded not guilty on 3 February 2011. Legal argument began, relating to a notice of motion for separate trials in respect of the offences relating to each of the three child victims and to set aside the Crown tendency notice to allow the evidence of each offence as tendency evidence in respect of each of the offences against each victim.

22 On 14 March 2011, the Court declined to separate the matter into three separate trials and ruled that the evidence in respect of each offence and each victim was admissible as tendency evidence. While I did not say so at the time of that ruling, I regarded the application as lacking significant merit. In lay terms I would describe the application as a desperate last roll of the dice.

23 In the course of the application, Mr Glissan QC, counsel for the offender, had appropriately conceded that, in the absence of the application succeeding, verdicts of guilty would be inevitable, at least in respect of some of the counts.

24 The parties sought time to discuss the future progress of the matter, and the offender entered pleas of guilty to a fresh Indictment on 15 March 2011 containing only seven counts of the twenty-one contained in the earlier indictment, and asked the Court to take into consideration the three Form 1 offences as previously referred to.

25 The factual allegations remained constant from the indictment of 20 December 2010 on which the offender was arraigned on 3 February 2011. The Crown merged certain charges resulting in 21 counts being reduced to seven counts and three offences to be taken into account pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The facts had also been consistent between the Local Court committal proceedings and the indictment on arraignment in the District Court, with the exception of changes in the alleged date range and/or location of some of the offences. 

26 The relevance of that history is to the discount for utility to be provided on sentence and the application of the Conferencing Act.

27 The Conferencing Act applies, with certain presently irrelevant exceptions, to all proceedings for an indictable offence heard in the Local Court sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court or at Central (s 4) and where a Court Attendance Notice was filed on or after 1 May 2008 (s 5 and reg 6 CCCT Regulation 2008) but before 8 October 2011 (CCCT Amendment Regulation 2011). That is, it applies to this matter.

28 Significantly, the Conferencing Act allows the Court to only provide a discount of up to 12.5% where a plea of guilty is entered after committal (s 17(2)). The Conferencing Act provides that the Court may only provide a discount of more than 12.5% for a plea of guilty after committal (s 17(4)) if the Court is satisfied the offender has proved on the balance of probabilities (s 17(6)) that ""substantial grounds"" as referred to in s 17(4) exist as referred to in s 17(5). The only grounds are those provided in s 17(5) subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d). It is not within those limited ""substantial"" grounds provided as a ground that the purposes of the Conferencing Act were frustrated by the failure of the prosecution to comply with the provisions of the Conferencing Act and orders made by the Local Court for compliance with that Act.

29 If the offender, as submitted, ""at all times, has been ready, willing and able to participate in the Case Conferencing regime"", it would have been a simple matter of consenting to a further adjournment in the Local Court for the Crown to comply with the relevant orders and requirements to enable a ""compulsory conference"" to take place before committal.

30 The only possible ground is s 17(5)(c) which provides that a greater discount may be provided if the offer to plead to an alternative offence is made for the first time, and accepted, after committal for trial, and the offender had no reasonable opportunity to offer to plead guilty to such an offence before the committal.

31 In this matter there is no evidence that the offender offered to plead guilty to any offence until after the application to reject tendency evidence and separate the offences into separate trials in respect of each victim. In the circumstances, the Court will allow the maximum discount permitted of 12.5%, taking account that it is a discount for the specific matters provided by s 16(2) of the Conferencing Act.

32 If the Court was not constrained by the provisions of the Conferencing Act the discount for the utility of the pleas would need to be considered with regard to the principles referred to in Thomson & Houlton [2000] 49 NSWLR 383 and subsequent cases including, but not limited to Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 Hodgson JA, with Barr J agreeing, at [5] to [6]; SY & Anor [2003] NSWCCA 291, Howie J, with Ipp JA and Whealy J agreeing at [85] to [87]; Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102, Howie J at [27] to [31] and the later qualification by Howie J as to what he meant in Borkowski.

33 In light of the possibility that the Court is in error in relation to the application of the Conferencing Act, it is appropriate to indicate that the Court is of the view that the discount of 12.5% is at the upper end of any appropriate range that might have otherwise applied. 

34 The offender knew that he had committed the offences and could not have been significantly misled by either error in the period or location as referred to in any of the charges prior to being committed. It was open to him to offer to plead guilty to amended and/or different offences on the basis of that knowledge and/or to offer compromise in respect of the number of offences to which he would plead. He did not do so.

35 The indictment of 20 December 2010 to which he pleaded not guilty contained the correct date periods and locations and they remained the same thereafter. The application on the date the trial was listed to commence to reject the tendency evidence and order three separate trials is inconsistent with any intention to plead to any offence. Negotiation between the parties thereafter did avert the necessity for a trial, but at such a late stage that the benefit to the community of ""utility"" was much diminished and the victims continued to suffer the stress of facing giving evidence in the trial until the ""last minute.""

THE FACTS

36 As a result of the fact that the offender only committed offences against victims provided to him by paedophile procurers or pimps who had already groomed the victims to be compliant with sexual activity with adult males, it is necessary that the facts contain material relating to the victims' prior grooming to provide a contextual understanding of why the victims were compliant and uncomplaining. The offender did not groom the victims but took advantage of criminal offending by others. The offender is to be sentenced for what he did in that context rather than the prior criminal conduct by others.

37 The facts are agreed and are as follows:

38PH 
In 1977 or 1978, John Thomas Shiel befriended PH, born on 2 December 1967, a couple of years after his mother died. PH was aged about nine or ten years and was in Year 5 at primary school. Shiel took the victim to the beach, to ride motorbikes, to swimming pools, to eat at McDonald's, and out to steakhouses for dinner. They would go bowling and play at pinball parlours. He was also given marijuana and alcohol and bought a BMX bike when he was in Year 7.

39 Shiel groomed PH for sexual activity. The grooming included sexual activity with other paedophiles, many of whom Shiel associated with, and Shiel made PH available to adult men for sexual purposes. Shiel himself took part in extensive sexual activity with PH when he was a child. The victim describes himself as knowing what to do when he went to bed with the adult men: ""I knew what was going on when I went into a room with a man"". He was paid money, which he gave to Shiel, and was bought a drum kit when he was in Year 8.

40 Shiel met the offender through PS. Shiel introduced PH to the offender when PH was about twelve years of age, in about 1980. PH says that meetings with other men seemed prearranged in that there was no real discussion about what would occur.

41 PH knew that the offender was named ""Mitch"" and that he owned or was a partner in a Pink Panther printing business that was near the city and had a forklift and a photocopier. He describes him as being smaller than Shiel, of stocky build with black short hair and glasses. He had an American accent, which was not strong. He dressed smartly.

COUNT 1

42 Between 31 July 1981 and 24 July 1983, Shiel took him to the offender's unit at Collaroy, where on a bed in a bedroom the offender penetrated PH's anus with his penis for about ten minutes, afterwards paying him $50, which PH paid to Shiel. The victim describes that by then ""it was like normal for me"".

COUNT 2

43 Between 31 December 1979 and 24 July 1983 Shiel took PH to the offender's house at Bellevue Hill. In an upstairs bedroom the offender penetrated PH's anus with his penis, afterwards paying him $50. The offender later told Shiel that he had had anal intercourse with PH.

44 PH once asked Shiel why they were not going to visit ""Mitch"" and he was told that ""Mitch"" was going to get married. He did not see the offender after this time.

45 The offender married Carol Mary Fox on 23 July 1983.

46 Shiel moved on to JH (PH's younger brother, now deceased). 

47 PH did not say anything as a child: his mother had died, and he was scared about what would happen if he said anything to his father. He says that he felt ""switched off"" about the offending.

48SM
From 1980, Shiel began to groom SM, who was born on 16 June 1970, for sexual activity with adult men. The victim was aged nine and his mother was a single mother with two children. Shiel recruited another child (JH) to engage SM in conversation, and following a grooming process, engaged in extensive sexual activity with SM, often with JH. The victim regularly stayed with Shiel for the weekend. 

49 SM was routinely supplied to other men for sexual purposes. This continued until 1988. These men often paid Shiel for sex with the victim. The victim describes himself as being prostituted out. SM was taken to Parramatta Speedway and other exciting outings. He was taken to ride motorbikes and played on Atari computer games. He received many gifts including a signed cricket bat, a watch, jewellery, clothes and video games. He was taken on holidays and to amusement parks. He was given alcohol, cigarettes and drugs. 

50  On an occasion between 30 April and 11 June 1981 Shiel took SM to the offender's house in Bellevue Hill and introduced him to the offender there.

51 SM had been instructed and trained by Shiel to do sexual acts with male adults without having to be asked, and knew not to act like ""a dead fish"" when participating in sexual acts.

COUNT 3

52 The victim describes the offender as being named ""Mitch"": dark haired, well groomed, nicely dressed, driving a gold Mercedes convertible, having an American accent and being an owner of Pink Panther Printing in Glebe. He was taken to the offender's apartment in Pittwater Road, Collaroy.

53 On the occasion when the offender and SM were introduced, between 30 April and 11 June 1981, the victim was taken to the offender's upstairs bedroom at his house in Bellevue Hill. The offender kissed SM with an open mouth and fondled his penis. The offender removed SM's clothing and SM undid the offender's zipper and placed the offender's penis in his mouth. The offender penetrated SM's anus with his penis for about twenty minutes until he ejaculated. 

54 Shiel recalls taking the victim to this house. Shiel says that the first evening SM met the offender, that SM went upstairs with the offender and ""SM, being young, was keen to give me a full description of what took place."" The disclosure included anal intercourse.

COUNT 4

55 On an occasion during the period from 27 August to 1 November 1981, Shiel took SM to the offender's Bellevue Hill house where, in an upstairs bedroom, the offender kissed SM and masturbated him, had SM masturbate him and penetrated SM's anus with his penis. The offender paid money to John Shiel or the victim. 

56 Shiel later told the victim that ""Mitch"" had gotten married and was going to have a ""normal"" life. SM didn't see the offender for about a year.

FORM 1 

57 In the summer of 1982-3, when SM was still in primary school and aged eleven or twelve years, he was taken to a house at Harbord owned by an associate of Shiel's, named PE, to whom the victim had often been exposed. The offender also went there. There had been discussions about the offender's marriage that took place later that year. In a hallway, the offender kissed SM on the mouth and groped his penis with his hand through SM's clothes. The offender also had SM grope his penis with his hand through the offender's clothes. The victim states that he felt powerless and had no control to be able to stop it. He knew it was wrong, but could not tell anyone as Shiel had threatened him. The victim describes feeling brainwashed by Shiel, and says he ""had gone from a sport-loving normal young boy who had dreams and goals in life to look forward to, and suddenly felt trapped in this horrible situation that I felt I couldn't get out of and didn't know how to"".

58AS 
AS was born on 5 September 1972. As a child, he was groomed to have sex with adult men by his uncle, PS. PS is now deceased, having committed suicide when he was investigated by police for similar offences in 1997. 

59 John Shiel spent time with PS and they were part of the same set of associates.

60 The victim described the offender (in his 1996 statement) as having dark hair, wealthy, wearing jewellery, having a red Mercedes convertible and a unit at the northern beaches. After making the statement to police in 1997, the victim conducted an Internet search that year on the history of Pink Panther and found the name ""Mitchell Fox"". He immediately recognised the name and remembered that he had called the offender ""Mitch"". He also remembered that the offender had an American or Canadian accent.

61AS was groomed for sexual activity by and with his uncle and to take part in sexual activity with adult men. He knew that he was expected to take part in sexual activity with men, including the offender. 

62 On three occasions between 27 August 1981 and 1 January 1985, AS went to the offender's unit at Collaroy. His uncle PS took him there. 

COUNT 5

63 On one occasion the offender placed his mouth on AS's penis and had AS take his penis into his mouth until the offender ejaculated.

FORM 1

64 On another occasion the offender again placed his mouth on AS's penis and had AS take his penis into his mouth until the offender ejaculated.

COUNT 6

65 On an occasion between 13 July 1981 and 1 January 1985 AS was taken by his uncle PS to a wharf at or near Birkenhead Point, Rozelle, and then on a motor cruiser marked ""Skipper a Clipper"" on Sydney Harbour. He recalled that the man was someone high up in Pink Panther printing. When he complained to police about this in 1996, he said he did not know this man's name. There was another boy present. PS and the other boy went out on a dinghy. AS and the offender were on a bed and the offender incited AS to masturbate him.

FORM 1

66 On an occasion between 13 July 1981 and 1 January 1985, AS was taken to a wharf at or near Akuna Bay and then on a motor cruiser marked ""Skipper a Clipper"" on the Hawkesbury River, in which the offender incited AS to masturbate him.

COUNT 7

67 On an occasion towards the end of the period from 31 December 1980 to 8 June 1984, AS was taken to the offender's house at Bellevue Hill, where, in a bedroom in the house or in a room near the pool, the offender fondled his penis and procured AS to suck his penis until the offender ejaculated. 

68 The victim describes how, by the time he was introduced to the offender, he was ""already sexually conditioned, I knew what was expected of me and how I was to behave in the presence of [this man]"".

LATER CONTACT BETWEEN THE OFFENDER AND JOHN SHIEL

69 In 1996, John Shiel was investigated in relation to a complaint made by AS (and another victim). He spoke to the offender, who spoke about his sexual contact with SM and AS and was ""far more concerned than I was due to the fact that he had had sexual contact with AS on three or four occasions"".

SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCES

70 Counts 1, 2, 3 & 4 - Buggery - s 79 of the Act - The offence of buggery required the penetration of the anus of a female or male of any age by a penis. It was a totally prohibited act of sexual intercourse, which in certain circumstances is no longer prohibited and s 79 was later repealed. Such sexual conduct with a child would now be dealt with under different provisions of the Act. However, the community has always regarded such sexual conduct with a child as abhorrent and very serious. 

71 There is some uncertainty as to the age of the victim at the time in respect of PH. Count 1 - thirteen to fifteen years of age; Count 2 - twelve to fifteen years of age. SM was ten years of age at the time of Count 3 and eleven years of age at the time of Count 4. Whatever the precise age of PH may have been at the time of the individual offences, he was a vulnerable child because of his youth, as was SM.

72 They were also vulnerable because of their prior grooming by others through whom the offender accessed them and of which he was aware. Indeed, their prior grooming and consequent compliant acquiescence for the offender's deviant sexual gratification was clearly an attractive quality to the offender, to whom they were a mere sexual commodity for which he was prepared to pay.

73 Accordingly, these are each very serious offences or, to use the Crown's expression, of the ""utmost gravity"".

74 When sentencing in respect of Count 4, the Court is asked to take into consideration a further offence against SM of Indecently Assaulting a Male contrary to s 81 of the Act. AS was taken to premises at Harbord by a paedophile associate of John Shiel. The offender was also in attendance at those premises. In a hallway of the premises, the offender kissed AS on the mouth and groped AS's penis through his clothes with his hand. The offender had AS similarly grope the offender's penis through his clothes. There is nothing in the facts to suggest that this was anything other than an unfortunate coincidence of attendance by AS and the offender of which the offender took opportunistic advantage. Apart from AS's age at the time, eleven, the offence falls into the least serious category of offending conduct within the range prohibited by this section. [See later comments in respect of Count 7]

75 Count 5 - Assault and Commit Act of Indecency on Victim under Sixteen years of age - s 61E(1) of the Act - The offender placed his penis in the mouth of AS until ejaculating, and placed his mouth on AS's penis. 

76 AS was nine to twelve years of age at the time, even at the oldest it was significantly less than the maximum age of the victim of sixteen years of age, at which point the offence would have fallen under a different provision carrying a lesser sentence. That is, while the section takes into account the victim's age, AS was substantially below that age, increasing the seriousness of the offence.

77 The act or acts of indecency would now come within the definition of sexual intercourse, which indicates that the community now takes a more serious view of such offending conduct than it did at the time of this offence. However, within those acts that would have constituted acts of indecency at the time, ""oral intercourse"" was a more seriously regarded form of offending conduct. For example, other conduct of a less serious nature that was covered by the section included the touching of the genitals or anus of a male or female either directly or through clothing.

78 AS was vulnerable because of the prior grooming by PS, through whom the offender accessed AS, and of which he was aware. The prior grooming and consequent compliant acquiescence by AS for the offender's deviant sexual gratification was clearly an attractive quality to the offender, to whom AS was a mere sexual commodity.

79 Accordingly, this is a very serious offence within the range of offending conduct then covered by the section.

80 The Form 1 offence to be taken into consideration on sentencing for Count 5 is contrary to the same provision as Count 5 and the offending conduct is also the same. The comments already made in respect of Count 5 need not be repeated in the circumstances.

81 Count 6 - Incite an Act of Indecency with Himself by a Victim Under Sixteen years of age - s 61E(2) of the Act - The offender incited AS to masturbate the offender. 

82 AS was nine to twelve years of age at the time, even at the oldest he was significantly less than the maximum of sixteen years of age relevant to s61E(2). That is, while the section takes into account the victim's age; AS was substantially below that age, increasing the seriousness of the offence.

83 An offence of inciting an act of indecency which involved an act of physical contact by the victim with the offender's penis, even though by hand, must be regarded as more serious than most other possible forms of offending behaviour to which this section applies.

84 AS was vulnerable because of the prior grooming by PS, through whom the offender accessed AS, and of which he was aware. The prior grooming and consequent compliant acquiescence by AS for the offender's deviant sexual gratification was clearly an attractive quality to the offender, to whom AS was a mere sexual commodity.

85 Accordingly, this is a very serious offence, although not the most potentially serious offence within the range of offending conduct covered by the section.

86 The Form 1 offence to be taken into consideration on sentencing for Count 6 is contrary to the same provision as Count 6 and the offending conduct is also the same. The comments already made in respect of Count 6 need not be repeated in the circumstances.

87 Count 7 - Indecent Assault on a Male - s 81 of the Act - The offender fondled AS's penis and procured AS to suck the offender's penis until the offender ejaculated.

88 The section refers to indecent assaults upon males of any age. AS was nine to eleven years of age at the time. The offending conduct of penile penetration of the mouth of the victim is now defined as an act of sexual intercourse and is the subject of a far more serious sentencing regime. However, the community has always regarded sexual conduct - let alone oral intercourse - with a child as abhorrent and very serious. It is made more offensive by the further degradation inflicted by ejaculation.

89 An indecent assault involving an act of physical contact with the victim's mouth by the offender's penis must be regarded as more serious than most other possible forms of offending behaviour to which this section applies. For example, other conduct that was covered by the section of a less serious nature included the touching of the genitals or anus of a male or female either directly or through clothing.

SERIOUSNESS AND THE COURSE OF CONDUCT

90 The offences were part of a continuing course of offending conduct over a significant period of time, approximately five years, by an intelligent and successful businessman. He had ample time to reflect upon the harm he was doing to his victims, and the likely future adverse impact on them of their future realization of the horrendous way in which they had been groomed and trained to acquiesce in being sexually abused by uncaring sexual deviants like him. The offender loses the benefit of any leniency that may have been afforded to him on the basis that the offences were part of an isolated incident: JCW (2000) 112 A Crim R 466.

91 The offender cannot hide behind the uncontested fact that the victims were groomed to be compliant and uncomplaining by others. His offending conduct took advantage of that fact and assisted in creating a market, paid or unpaid, for sexually abused children and encouraged the continuing degradation of the victims and the recruitment of future victims.

92 In the course of submissions on sentence, Mr Glissan QC, appearing for the offender, has sought to diminish the significance of the offender's conduct by referring to the victims as having ""consented"" or ""consenting"" to the offending behaviour. In the sense that in their contact with the offender they were not verbally or physically threatened by him and did not say ""No"" or physically resist, that is correct. However, ""consent"", or what I would refer to as naïve compliant acquiescence, is not a mitigating factor, as children are to be protected from sexual conduct even if they are willing participants. This is particularly so in cases involving young children. In this case, the child victims were only willing participants because their worlds had been so warped by previous paedophile grooming of which the offender was fully aware and relied on. ""Consent"" or ""naïve compliant acquiescence"" in this case does not mitigate the seriousness of the offence or the moral culpability of the offender.

VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS

93 Each of the victims gave a Victim Impact statement which they read in Court. The statements were impressive and eloquent testimony to the very serious psychological consequences that offences such as these against children must have, particularly where they do not realize until reaching greater maturity the seriousness of the conduct that they had been deceived and manipulated to acquiesce in. The commission of these offences has very substantially impacted on their lives and the psychological consequences are perhaps unlikely to ever be resolved.

94 It must be noted that their statements canvassed matters outside those permitted in a Victim Impact statement. No objection was taken to that course on behalf of the offender on the basis that the Court would have regard to only that which is permitted and that it would assist the victims to be able to express themselves without limitation. Indeed, it is not reasonable to expect that victims abused by so many other than the offender over significant periods of time could somehow confine themselves to the impact of this offender's conduct. The Court regards the concession as significant, appropriate and of assistance.

95 In addition, as was said by Howie J in R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at [37]:

""The attitude of the victim cannot be allowed to interfere with a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. This is so whether the attitude expressed is one of vengeance or of forgiveness: R v Glen (unreported, CCA, NSW, No 60738 of 1993, 19 December 1994). Sentencing proceedings are not a private matter between the victim and the offender, not even to the extent that the determination of the appropriate punishment may involve meting out retribution for the wrong suffered by the victim. A serious crime is a wrong committed against the community at large and the community is itself entitled to retribution. In particular, crimes of violence committed in public are an affront to the peace and good order of the community and require deterrent sentences: R v Henderson (unreported, CCA, NSW, 5 November 1997). Matters of general public importance are at the heart of the policies and principles that direct the proper assessment of punishment, the purpose of which is to protect the public, not to mollify the victim.""

96 Relevant to the Victim Impact statements was the appropriate acknowledgement in advance by Ms K. Shead, Crown Prosecutor, that the Victim Impact statements to be given would not take the impact in respect of any of the victims beyond what could reasonably be expected to occur in respect of offences of this nature against children.

SUBJECTIVE MATTERS

97 The offender did not give evidence on sentence.

98 Subjective matters have been drawn from the Pre-Sentence Report of Marta Mayayo, Probation and Parole Officer, dated 2 May 2011 [part of Exhibit 1] and the witnesses called on behalf of the offender and various reports and testimonials tendered [part of Exhibit 2].

99 Exhibit 1 contains a criminal history that indicates that the offender has never been convicted of any offence in New South Wales. The Court accepts, the offender having been born and raised in the United States of America, that he has no history of criminal offending other than these matters. 

100 The evidence called on behalf of the offender was from:

Gerard Phillip Webster - Forensic Psychologist providing counselling to the offender since June 2009.
Carol Mary Fox - A co-worker at IBM since 1973, a business partner since 1982 and a de facto partner since late 1982, they commenced to cohabit, not at his premises in either Bellevue Hill or Collaroy, but at Hunters Hill in December 1982 prior to their marriage on 23 July 1983. Before they separated in 1990 there were two daughters born of the marriage.
Glen James Ford - An employee of the offender from the age of fifteen in 1973 and later friend.
Peter Duncan Whitford - A friend of the offender since Mr Whitford was aged fifteen, approximately forty years ago, the offender being also a family friend in the United States of America. He worked for the offender when aged seventeen in the offender's printing business at Kings Cross, Sydney. Married with four children, girls now aged fifteen, twelve and nine and a boy nine years of age, he has had ongoing contact with the offender in the intervening period and they have shared family holidays. He spoke at the United Nations ""Global Impact Conference"" in respect of labour rights and international issues regarding child labour. He is a member of the Pasadena Boys and Girls Club in the US, which assists 30,000 underprivileged children. He, together with his wife started a charity called ""Chances for Children"" which assists underprivileged children in the US.
101 In addition a number of expert reports have been tendered:

W. John Taylor - Forensic Psychologist - dated 17 April 2011.
Gerard Webster - Forensic Psychologist as previously referred to - dated 27 April 2011.
102 Also tendered was a Letter of Confirmation of Treatment from a Dr Ron Morstyn - Psychiatrist - dated 21 March 2011. It is convenient to note at this point that the letter merely confirms that the offender was a patient of Dr Morstyn for ""psychiatric treatment (psychotherapy)"" from 11 November 1996 until 24 December 1999 and from 1 May 2008 to 23 April 2009 on a weekly basis. The letter contains no information as to what the treatment was for or what effect it may have had. As there is no report from Dr. Morstyn, the letter is off no real assistance to the Court.

103 In addition there are seventeen character testimonials from friends, business associates, the offender's two daughters and fellow participants in ""men's groups"". Also included are written testimonials from Mrs C. Fox, Mr P. Whitford and Mr G. Ford, and a report from Mr G. Webster, as referred to above. 

104 The offender was thirty-six to forty-one years of age during the five-year period in which the offences were committed. He is now sixty-eight years of age. He was born in the United States of America in 1943 and migrated to Australia in 1971. His parents are deceased, as is one of his three siblings. His childhood was uneventful other than at the age of fourteen he is said to have been sexually abused by a three or four year older friend of his older brother on numerous occasions.

105 He was financially well supported but described himself as not being emotionally supported by his parents. It appears from the Pre-sentence Report that it was to deal with this issue that he received psychotherapy from Dr Morstyn and because the psychological report from Mr G. Webster indicates that treatment by Dr Morstyn ceased because he was ""not willing to discuss Mr Fox's history of sexual abuse against minors in a specific manner"".

106 It is noted that Mr Webster states:
""Mr Fox had attempted to address his relationship difficulties and child sexual abuse in multiple courses of treatment crossing a range of interventions in vogue from 1982. Mr Fox had not tabulated his entire history at the time of (self) referral but he has done so more recently. Mr Fox has provided me with a list of 18 separate psycho-education and treatment interventions, commencing with seminars presented by an internationally renowned psychiatrist, Dr Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. It is noted that according to the evidence before the Court about the period of his offending, Mr Fox was actively seeking psychological help at a time that he was abusing boys. From discussions with Mr Fox, he was denying the harmful impact of his sexual offences on his victims at the time the crimes were committed. He thought that he was giving them as much pleasure as they were giving him. This is a typical cognitive distortion for many offenders. It was only after a period of years of personal reflection that he came to recognise that the boys would have been harmed just as he had been when he was abused as a young adolescent"".

107 Contrary to Mr Webster's anticipation of what evidence would be before the Court, there is no evidence that at the time of the offending Mr Fox was actively seeking psychological help, or if he was, that it related to his then offending behaviour. The Court does, however, accept in view of the cessation of offending, either relatively shortly before or after significantly changing his lifestyle by marrying in 1983 that the offender was seeking to address his offending conduct.

108 That he did so appears to indicate that he was in fact fully cognisant of the harmfulness of his conduct at the time of his offending, no matter how he may have sought to rationalize it. In the circumstances, including that he has not given evidence on sentence so that the Court could make its own assessment, it is not possible to accept his assertion to Mr W. John Taylor, psychologist, that ""at the time of committing the offences he did not consider it to be wrong and he said that 'I had zero awareness'"". It may provide some explanation for the conduct but it does not excuse it, particularly when it continued for five years, and was apparently hidden from all others except those who engaged in the same deviant behaviour, or could supply children to satisfy his sexual desires.

109 That he was sexually abused as a child has some relevance in mitigation but the weight to be given to this circumstance will depend on the facts of the individual case: AB (1999) 198 CLR 111; Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207. On the facts asserted by the offender, it seems that he engaged in a mutually exploratory homosexual act with an older but young partner at age fourteen or fifteen and found the experience enjoyable. Any mitigation from such an event is limited and greatly outweighed by the need for general deterrence.

110 The offender has been in treatment with Mr Webster since June 2009 relevant to the offending conduct.

111 The offender has been married twice and has three children, daughters now aged twenty-seven and twenty-four from his first marriage to Carol Fox and a fifteen year old son from his second marriage in respect of whom he shared custody until being refused bail.

112 After completing school in the United States he attended University and graduated with a degree in applied science specialising in printing and printing management. In 1972, he commenced his own printing company in Australia, Pink Panther Printing, which he sold in 1983. Since that time he has been engaged in property development.

113 In respect of the evidence called on character and the seventeen testimonials from friends, business associates, the offender's two daughters and fellow participants in ""men's groups"", it is appropriate by way of summary, without endeavouring to diminish the scope or high quality of that material, to observe that the offender has been held in very high esteem in the past and continues to be held in high esteem, including by many that he closely associated with at the time of committing the offences while hiding from them his true character.

114 The offender has no criminal convictions.

115 Good character, however, is of diminished significance, but not insignificant, where the offending conduct was carried out over such an extensive period and where the offences are, as here, by a mature and intelligent adult against children.

REMORSE AND CONTRITION

116 While a number of the testimonials and reports make reference to the offender expressing remorse, the Court is unable to form an opinion as to the extent of remorse where the offender did not give evidence. Any expression of remorse referred to has been made only after entering the pleas of guilty. A plea of guilty in itself is not necessarily evidence of remorse, particularly where it comes at the doorstep of trial. The Court accepts that the offender has accepted by the plea responsibility for his actions.

REHABILITATION AND RISK OF RE-OFFENDING

117 The Court accepts that the offender has made efforts to rehabilitate himself by obtaining treatment at least from Mr Webster, if not also treatment or assistance in the past, as referred to by Mr Webster. 

118 The fact that there has been no further offending and that the offender substantially changed his lifestyle a very substantial period of time ago indicates that he has been able to change or control the impulse to offend in this manner. Taking that into account, together with his current age, the Court accepts that there has been substantial rehabilitation by his own efforts and that the risk of re-offending is low. The Court notes, however, that the evidence of Mr Webster in cross-examination was that despite all the therapy, he was in danger of relapse, like all sex offenders, and that he would be more vulnerable at times of anxiety and stress. These factors reduce the need for specific deterrence and are relevant to consideration of a variation in favour of the offender in the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term by a reduction in the non-parole period to ensure that on release the offender is assisted by a longer period of supervision than would be the case if the statutory relationship was maintained.

SENTENCE CONSIDERATION

119 For the purposes of sentencing, I have regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I must take into account such of the aggravating factors outlined in s 21A(2) of that Act as are present, and such of the mitigating factors referred to in subs (3) of that section as are present, and any other relevant factor. In sentencing an offender, the sentence must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and the sentencing judge must fix a sentence that will ensure the time the offender must spend in custody reflects all of the circumstances of the offence including the objective seriousness and the need for general deterrence and specific deterrence, and meet the fundamental purpose of punishment, the protection of society. 

120 I am satisfied pursuant to s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. It is clear that the sentences to be imposed in respect of such serious offences as these must be terms of full time imprisonment. The parties are in agreement with that conclusion and their submissions have accepted such sentences as inevitable.

121 The offender was refused bail on 29 April 2011 and has been in custody since that time and only in respect of these offences. The sentence will backdate to 29 April 2011.

122 The offender has been held under a Protective Custody Direction (AKA Protected Limited Association) both because of the nature of the offences and at his request. A letter from W. McPhillips, Manager of Security, Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, states that although there are limited work opportunities at MRRC there are no restrictions on visits, education or any other program services. The time out of the cell has been limited to two to three hours; the general population at MRRC receive up to six hours. Once classified he will be moved to another gaol where his hours out of the cell will be increased and greater work opportunities will be available. On that evidence there has been little or no hardship, other than the reduced hours out of the cell and as to the future it appears that continuation of protection may be terminated on the offender's request.

123 In Clinton [2009] NSWCCA 276 it was stated: 

""In any event, decisions about the significance of protective custody given before R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299; 58 NSWLR 581 should be read in the light of that decision and the different approach that was then taken to the relevance of the fact that a person was in protective custody. The change to the approach previously taken was as a result of information provided to the Court that revealed that protection did not necessarily result in harsher prison conditions. That change in approach was continued in R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97; 145 A Crim R 304, was approved in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 268 at [177] and has been applied to cases where assistance has been given to authorities: R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92."" 

124 Where harsher conditions of protection are proved, that is a matter taken into account in determining the length of the term on the basis that the offender may not be released to parole. If it is taken into account in that way, it automatically has an effect on the non-parole period because of the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the total term. It should not be taken into account again in a finding of special circumstances because it is in effect double counting: see R v S [2000] NSWCCA 13 at [33]. 

125 Although no real hardship has been proved the Court recognizes that because of the nature of these offences such offenders tend to be badly treated within the prison system by other prisoners. It is accordingly likely that the offender may remain in protection.

126 While in this matter the Court finds, in view of rehabilitation and the low risk of re-offending, that specific deterrence is a much less important factor on sentence than it would normally be, the sentences must reflect the need for general deterrence. General deterrence is of great importance in respect of offences of this nature committed against children. They are frequently not reported until many years later when the then adult victim manages to overcome the self-loathing arising from naïve participation and the fear of the consequences of disclosure to their own psychological health.

127 There has been a significant delay between commission of the offences and sentencing. In MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 it was held that where, by reason of delay, an offender is exposed to a harsher punishment and sentencing regime than that which existed at the time of the offence, and if an authentic and credible body of statistical material exists that is capable of reconstructing what would have been done previously, then the approach outlined in Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37 should be adopted. 

128 In Shore Badgery-Parker J at [42] said: 
""In my opinion I should, so far as I am able to do so, seek to impose upon the offender a sentence appropriate not only to then applicable statutory maxima but also to then appropriate sentencing patterns. That is by no means easy, but in my view I must endeavour to do so.""

129 In the absence of such statistical material, the Court is constrained to take the non-statistical approach as described by Howie J in Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at 511, and approved by Sully J in MJR at [107] and endorsed by Spigelman CJ at [31].

130 Where considerable delay has occurred before sentencing, the sentencing judge must have regard to the maximum sentence and the level of sentences in fact imposed at the date of the offence. 

131 The Crown has provided such limited statistics as are available and both parties have referred the Court to a number of cases. However, as indicated, the statistics are very limited and the Court has found them of little assistance. All of the cases to which the Court was referred have been considered. Individual cases turn on the individual facts and subjective circumstances. The cases referred to have been of some general assistance in determining the general sentencing pattern at the time.

132 A matter of particular importance is referred to in Featherstone [2008] NSWCCA 71 by Bell JA, Adams and Latham JJ agreeing, at [33] to [47] referring to the general increase in sentences since the early eighties and the significant difference of non-parole periods under the then current legislation falling into a range of 33% to 50% of the total sentence, and now being 75% pursuant to the current provisions. The Court held that the change in the relationship of the non-parole to the total term was in itself sufficient to justify a finding of special circumstances so that the non-parole period for an old offence would more appropriately reflect the pattern of sentencing at the time of the offence.

133 The Court will sentence the offender on the basis of what it understands to be the general sentencing pattern at the time of the commission of the offences.

134 The Court has also taken into account that this is the first time that the offender will be subject to a term of imprisonment and has also provided the 12.5% discount for the utility pursuant to the Conferencing Act as previously referred to. 

135 Mr Fox, would you please stand? I will deal with the sentences in a different order to the order of the counts in the indictment, commencing with Count 6 and continuing 7, 5, 1, 2, 3 and 4. 

136 In respect of Count 6 and taking into account the offence contained on the Form 1, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing on 29 April 2011 and expiring on 28 October 2011. 

137 In respect of Count 7, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months which will commence three months after the commencement of the last imposed sentence, that is, it will commence on 29 July 2011 and expire on 28 April 2012. 

138 In respect of Count 5 and taking into account the offence contained on the Form 1, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of one year to commence six months after the commencement of the last imposed term of imprisonment, that is, it will commence on 29 January 2012 and expire on 28 January 2013. 

139 In respect of Count 1, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months to commence six months after the commencement of the last imposed term of imprisonment. It will commence on 29 July 2012 and expire on 28 January 2014.

140 In respect of Count 2, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months commencing six months after the last imposed term of imprisonment. It will commence on 29 January 2013 and expire on 28 July 2014.

141 In respect of Count 3, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months. It will commence six months after the commencement of the last imposed term of imprisonment, that is, it will commence on 29 July 2013, and it will expire on 28 January 2015.

142 In respect of Count 4 and taking into account the further offence on the Form 1, you are sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of six years and three months. It will commence six months after the last imposed term of imprisonment. Having found special circumstances, as indicated, the non-parole period will be one year and nine months commencing on 29 January 2014 and expiring on 28 October 2015. 

143 The balance of term is four years and six months commencing 29 October 2015 and expiring on 28 April 2020. You will, accordingly, Mr Fox, first be eligible for parole on 28 October 2015. 

144 The overall effective accumulated non-parole period is one of four and a half years from 29 April 2011 and the balance of term is four and a half years, that is, the overall total accumulated sentences are nine years, that is, the accumulated non-parole period is 50% of the overall term. 

145 I recommend that when released on parole the offender be subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service in particular with respect to sexual offending, counselling and/or treatment. 

146 Mr Fox, when released on parole if you are in breach of the then conditions of your parole you will, of course, end up being returned to custody. You can sit down, thank you.

2708922,Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242,"Judgment 

1TOBIAS AJA : I agree with Johnson J. 

2JOHNSON J : The Applicant, Mark Allan Paxton, seeks leave to appeal with respect to sentences imposed at the Newcastle District Court on 6 November 2009. 

3As will be seen, the Applicant was sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment. The Applicant had committed several serious drug supply offences and an offence of receiving stolen jewellery valued at more than $100,000.00. The questions for this Court to consider are whether patent error is demonstrated with respect to the sentences passed or latent error in the form of manifestly excessive sentences. 

The Sentences Imposed 

4Following pleas of guilty, the Applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Berman SC to terms of imprisonment for the following offences: 


 





Offence

Maximum Penalty

Standard Non-Parole Period

Sentence Imposed



Count 1 - On about 9-10 May 2008 supply more than the large commercial quantity of MDMA (ecstasy) (8.497 kg) contrary to s.25 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (â€œDMT Actâ€) (large commercial quantity of MDMA - 500 grams)

Life imprisonment

15 years

Non-parole period of 16 years from 10 May 2013 to 9 May 2029 with a balance of term of seven years from 10 May 2029 to 9 May 2036

Count 3 - Between 16 March 2008 and 10 May 2008 supply more than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (2.314 kg) contrary to s.25 DMT Act (large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine - 1 kg)

Life imprisonment 

15 years

Fixed term of imprisonment for 12 years from 10 May 2011 to 9 May 2023
 
(Form 1 offences were taken into account - see [6] below)
 


Count 4 - Between 19 January 2008 and 11 May 2008 receiving stolen goods (jewellery valued at $104,000.00) contrary to s.188 Crimes Act 1900

10 yearsâ€™ imprisonment

---

Fixed term of imprisonment for three years from 10 May 2008 to 9 May 2011
 
5In passing sentence on the first count, the sentencing Judge was asked to take into account, on a Form 1, an offence of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime ($2,700.00 in cash) contrary to s.193C(1) Crimes Act 1900 and an offence of supplying more than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin) (an admixture of 468.3 grams of heroin and rice) contrary to s.25(2) DMT Act. The commercial quantity of heroin is 250 grams and a large commercial quantity is one kilogram. 

6In passing sentence on the third count, the sentencing Judge was asked to take into account, on a Form 1, two offences of supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis) (an actual supply of 3.149 kilograms and a deemed supply of 2.673 kilograms) contrary to s.25(1) DMT Act. The indictable quantity of cannabis is one kilogram and the commercial quantity is 25 kilograms. 

7Accordingly, the Applicant was sentenced to a total effective non-parole period of 21 years commencing on 10 May 2008 and expiring on 9 May 2029, with a balance of term of seven years commencing on 10 May 2029 and expiring on 9 May 2036. 

Grounds of Appeal 

8The Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

(a) Ground 1 - The learned Sentencing Judge erred in his characterisation of the objective seriousness of the supply offences (Counts 1-3). 

(b) Ground 2 - His Honour erred in not properly identifying the objective seriousness of Count 3. 

(c) Ground 3 - His Honour erred in not setting non-parole periods for Counts 2-3. 

(d) Ground 4 - The sentences imposed for each of the supply offences are manifestly excessive. 

(e) Ground 5 - The total effective sentence is manifestly excessive. 

Facts of Offences 

9An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered on sentence in the District Court. Given the issues raised on appeal, it is appropriate to spell out, in some detail, the nature and extent of the Applicant's drug supply operation as contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts. 

10As will be seen, the Applicant's operation revealed a significant level of organisation, and a wide range of illicit products for sale, in the Balmain house which was the centre of his activities. 

Background 

11In November 2007, Lake Macquarie Police established a Strike Force to investigate the supply of drugs in the Newcastle area. The main target of the investigation was Frank Orchard (""Orchard""). 

12In February 2008, a co-offender, Darren Burnett (""Burnett""), offered to act as a drug courier for Orchard. Orchard asked Burnett to source a reliable supplier of methylamphetamine who was capable of supplying 10-20 ounces (.28 to .56 kilograms) of ice each time, every couple of weeks. 

13Police had Orchard under 24-hour surveillance. Lawful intercepts of the telephones of Orchard and Burnett were undertaken. Evidence obtained in this way established that Orchard conducted a very busy drug supply business. 

14By mid-February 2008, Burnett was unable to source the quantities required by Orchard to maintain his level of business activity. His contacts led him to Sydney. 

Involvement of the Applicant from March 2008 

15On 14 March 2008, a contact of Burnett introduced him to the Applicant, described as ""the guy from Balmain"" . The Applicant, then aged 33 years, was living on his own in a house in Birchgrove Road, Balmain. 

16The Applicant and Burnett met in a car at the Balmain Leagues Club carpark. The Applicant produced about an ounce of methylamphetamine in ice form. Burnett sampled about half a gram of this and determined that it was high quality. The Applicant told Burnett that he could supply 15 ounces of ice at a bulk rate of $6,500.00 per ounce. 

17The Applicant provided Burnett with his mobile telephone number. The Applicant led Burnett to his house in Birchgrove Road, Balmain. Real estate checks established that the Applicant was the tenant of those premises, and that the Applicant had indicated to the real estate agent that he needed to rent the premises whilst a property which he owned (at Redfern) was being renovated. 

18Between 14 and 17 March 2008, Orchard was recorded telling customers that supplies would be available in the near future. 

19On 15 March 2008, contact was made between the Applicant and Burnett where agreement was reached on a price of $7,500.00 for an ounce of ice. Orchard gave Burnett $110,000.00 and directed him to purchase 10 ounces of ice for $75,000.00, and 16 ounces (one pound) of methylamphetamine in speed form for the quoted price of $35,000.00. 

Events on 17 March 2008 

20In the early hours of 17 March 2008, Burnett went to the Applicant's house in Birchgrove Road, Balmain. He told the Applicant he wanted to buy 10 ounces of ice and gave the Applicant $75,000.00. The drugs were to be delivered later that morning. The Applicant telephoned a contact and the money was picked up. Later that morning, the 10 ounces were delivered. The Applicant met that contact in the front bedroom of his house. The Applicant then supplied the methylamphetamine to Burnett. 

21At his house, the Applicant had three bags of methylamphetamine in speed form, premixed with a cutting agent. The Applicant showed Burnett three bags of methylamphetamine with different prices written on each bag - $25,000.00, $35,000.00 and $45,000.00. Burnett purchased the $35,000.00 bag, which weighed 16 ounces. 

22Whilst waiting for the drugs to be delivered, the Applicant showed Burnett the different types of drugs he could procure. They included ecstasy (MDMA), cocaine, LSD and heroin. The Applicant told Burnett that he could sell tablets for $11.00 each if a minimum of 1,000 were purchased, or for $10.00 each if a minimum of 10,000 were purchased. As will be seen, several thousand MDMA tablets were located when the Applicant's premises were later searched, the large majority of them being packaged in 1,000 tablet lots. 

23The Applicant went upstairs and returned with a Tupperware container, which appeared to contain a white plaster with rice grains mixed in. The Applicant told Burnett this was heroin, and that he had mixed rice into it to absorb the moisture, resulting in a brick of set admixture. The Applicant offered this for sale at $10,000.00 an ounce. Burnett accepted a small sample, but declined the offer to purchase. 

24The ice was delivered to the house. The Applicant supplied Burnett with 737 grams of ice, which he took from the house (part of Count 3). 

Events in April 2008 

25On 6 April 2008, another deal was organised with a supplier other than the Applicant, as Orchard had not been happy paying $7,500.00 per ounce. However, Orchard was not happy with the quality of the drug from the other supplier. Contact was made again between Burnett and the Applicant. The Applicant asked Burnett to travel down to Balmain on 13 April 2008. Text messages passed between the Applicant and Burnett. In one text message, the Applicant enquired when Burnett was going to arrive at Balmain, saying ""Hey bro can you call when you pull up dogs go sik"" . That call referred to two pit-bull terriers owned by the Applicant which became aggressive when they heard cars at the front of the house. 

26On 13 April 2008, the Applicant provided a sample of ice to Burnett, who tested it and was satisfied it was of high quality. He ordered 18 ounces (half a kilogram), with the Applicant stating that he could supply that quantity for $115,000.00. 

27Whilst Burnett was at the Applicant's house on 13 April 2008, the Applicant showed him some items of jewellery. A robbery had occurred at the Mondial jewellery store in the Queen Victoria Building on 19 January 2008, with close to $2 million worth of jewellery being stolen. This jewellery came from that robbery. The Applicant enquired of Burnett as to whether he was interested in buying any of the jewellery items. The Applicant had mainly rings and loose stones, pink and white diamonds, with some of the items still bearing price tags. The Applicant offered the items for sale at one-third of the price on the tags. Burnett bought a $2,500.00 ring for $800.00 for his partner. This ring was discovered later by police in Burnett's house when a search was conducted at the time of his arrest. 

28When the Applicant's house was searched on his arrest on 9 May 2008, police located jewellery from the Mondial robbery worth $104,000.00 (Count 4). 

29On 15 April 2008, Burnett collected $117,000.00 from Orchard. He had inflated the cost per ounce of the methylamphetamine so as to make a $2,000.00 profit himself from the deal. Burnett arrived at the Applicant's house at about 7.00 pm, and the Applicant supplied him with 18 ounces of ice for $115,000.00 (part of Count 3). 

30During that visit, Burnett asked the Applicant whether he sold cannabis, saying ""What about pot, you've got everything else"" . The Applicant told Burnett that he was getting a couple of pounds the following day. 

31On 17 April 2008, Burnett offered to buy from the Applicant the heroin that had been shown to him (see [23] above) together with some of the diamonds (see [27] and [28] above). 

Events in May 2008 

32On 8 May 2008, Burnett gave the Applicant $110,000.00 for 18 to 20 ounces of methylamphetamine. He also arranged to buy some cannabis from the Applicant. 

33On 9 May 2008, Burnett travelled to the Applicant's house in Balmain to collect the methylamphetamine. When Burnett arrived, the Applicant was out on his motorbike collecting the drugs. On his return, the Applicant supplied Burnett with 20 ounces of methylamphetamine (part of Count 3). 

34While at the house on 9 May 2008, Burnett asked the Applicant whether he could still buy cannabis. The Applicant went to a large duffle bag on the lounge room floor, opened it and tossed one pound bags of cannabis, 10 in total, to Burnett. Burnett concealed the 10 bags of cannabis in a spare tyre which was placed in the boot of Burnett's vehicle (first offence on Form 1 on Count 3). 


35Burnett had not paid for two ounces of the methylamphetamine or the cannabis, so the Applicant entered a debt of $45,000.00 into a ledger book ($32,000.00 for the cannabis and $13,000.00 for the methylamphetamine). 

36Burnett asked the Applicant for, and was given, a small quantity (3.5 grams) of methylamphetamine. Burnett said that as he had been awake for so long, he needed something to keep him alert. The Applicant had distinctive small resealable plastic bags, some with smiley faces, red devil heads and other logos (see [45] below). Burnett used part of this drug on the way home. When he was arrested later that day, he had in his pocket a small resealable plastic bag with red devil heads printed on it. The bag contained .5 grams of methylamphetamine in ice form, with a purity of 71%. 

37Burnett drove back to Newcastle and contacted Orchard, intending to drop the methylamphetamine over to him. 

Arrest and Search on 9 May 2008 

38At this point, police co-ordinated the arrests of persons including the Applicant and Burnett. At 10.20 pm on 9 May 2008, a search warrant was executed on the Applicant's house at Balmain and on the homes of Burnett and Orchard as well. 

39At the Applicant's home, in various locations, the police found a total of 517.3 grams of methylamphetamine (part of Count 3). 

40The heroin offered by the Applicant to Burnett was found, with the total weight of the admixture being 468.3 grams, with a purity of 4.5%. Supply of this drug was taken into account on sentence (first offence on Form 1 on Count 1). The commercial quantity of heroin is 250 grams. The Prosecutor in the District Court explained that, although it was unusual for a charge of supplying a commercial quantity of heroin to be placed on a Form 1, this course had been taken because of the quite low purity of the drug (T20.22-29, 6 November 2009). 

41Police found $2,700.00 in cash in the Applicant's house. This offence was taken into account on sentence (second offence on Form 1 on Count 1). 

42Police also found a total of 2.673 kilograms of cannabis in the Applicant's home. This offence was taken into account on sentence (second offence on Form 1 on Count 3). The indictable quantity of cannabis is one kilogram. 

43Methylamphetamine was located in several places in the Applicant's house. In the freezer in the kitchen, a plastic resealable bag was located containing 445.1 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 3.5%. 

44Also located was a knotted plastic freezer bag containing 25.4 grams of methylamphetamine with an unknown purity. 

45The coffee table in the lounge room of the Applicant's house had a drawer which contained a white plastic hinged flip top container, which appeared to be a sample pack. Inside this pack, amongst other prohibited drugs, were eight small resealable plastic bags each containing methylamphetamine, with a total amount of 5.8 grams. Some of these bags bore unique logos, being red devil head bags and yellow smiley face bags. 

46Also in the coffee table drawer was a brown paper bag containing two plastic resealable bags, with a total of 41 grams of methylamphetamine at 6.5% purity. 

First Count - Supply More Than Large Commercial Quantity of MDMA 

47Police also located a total of 38,700 tablets of MDMA (ecstasy) weighing 8.497 kilograms, bagged in lots of 1,000 (Count 1). A large commercial quantity of MDMA is 500 grams. 

48In the front bedroom of the house, police located a blue Gant brand duffle bag, which was closed with a zipper and had a padlock attached. The packaging for that padlock was located in the kitchen bin. The key was on a keyring which also held the key to the Applicant's motorcycle. Within the duffle bag, police found five blue Coles' brand chiller bags, each closed with a zipper. 

49The first chiller bag had ""Green stars x 5 & extras"" written on the top of the bag in black marker pen. Within the bag were three plastic freezer bags, knotted at the top. Each bag contained green MDMA tablets with a star logo. The total weight of the three bags was 678.3 grams with an average purity of 33%. Each bag contained approximately 1,000 tablets. Also within this bag were two loose orange-pink tablets (a total of 3,002 tablets). 

50The second chiller bag had ""Pakmen orange x 8"" written on the top of the bag in black marker pen. Within the bag were seven knotted plastic freezer bags, each containing pink pills, each with a ""Pacman"" logo. Each freezer bag held an average of 225 grams, corresponding to 1,000 MDMA tablets per bag. The total weight in this bag was 1,580.7 grams, with an average purity of 32.5% (a total of 7,000 tablets). 

51The third chiller bag had ""Green swirls x 9"" written on the top of the bag in black marker pen. The bag contained seven plastic freezer bags knotted at the top, each containing green MDMA tablets marked with a swirl logo. Again, the bags were divided into 227.2 gram weight, being about 1,000 tablets. The total weight in this chiller bag was 1590.4 grams at an average purity of 33%. There were also two loose purple MDMA tablets with an alien logo, weighing 0.4 grams in total (a total of 7,002 tablets). 

52The fourth chiller bag had ""Stars orange x 17"" written on the top of the bag in black marker pen. In this bag were 11 plastic freezer bags knotted at the top. Each bag contained orange-pink tablets with a ""star"" logo. The bags were in 224 gram weights. The total weight in this bag was 2,466.7 grams, with an average purity of 31.5%. There were a further 29 tablets with various logos loose in the bottom of this bag, with these weighing 6.1 grams (a total of 11,029 tablets). 

53The fifth chiller bag had ""Green V x 14"" written on the top of the bag in black marker pen. The bag contained 10 plastic freezer bags tied with a knot. Eight of the bags contained green tablets with a ""V"" logo. The total weight of these was 1,791.3 grams. Two of the bags contained blue tablets with a ""Pacman"" logo. The total weight of these was 220.3 grams (a total of 10,000 tablets). These tablets bore the same colour and logo as the MDMA tablets found at Burnett's house, which had previously been offered to him by the Applicant. 

54In the front bedroom, on the bottom shelf of the wardrobe, police located a plastic freezer bag knotted at the top. This contained pink MDMA tablets with a ""star"" logo weighing 106.3 grams, this equating to about 500 tablets. 

55In a drawer of the coffee table in the lounge room, police located a brown paper bag containing several plastic resealable bags with approximately 100 green MDMA tablets (weighing 20.2 grams) and one purple MDMA tablet (weighing 0.19 grams). 

56In the coffee table drawer, police also located a knotted plastic freezer bag, containing green tablets with a ""V"" logo. These tablets bore the same colour and logo as those found in the fifth chiller bag in the front bedroom (see [53] above). These tablets weighed 22.6 grams, totalling approximately 110 MDMA tablets. 

57In the white plastic-hinged container sample pack in the coffee table drawer, amongst other prohibited drugs, there was a single orange-pink MDMA tablet with a star logo weighing 0.2 grams. This was similar to the tablets found in the fourth chiller bag in the wardrobe in the front bedroom (see [52] above). 

58In the blue Gant duffle bag, there was a silver pencil case. It contained, amongst other things, one plastic resealable bag containing nine white MDMA tablets with a crown logo (weighing 2.2 grams) and a plastic resealable bag containing one white tablet with an animal logo (weighing 0.2 grams). 

59In total, there was 8.497 kilograms of MDMA, comprising more than 38,700 tablets (Count 1). 
 
Second Count - Supply More than Commercial Quantity of Cocaine 

60Police also found a total of 335.3 grams of cocaine, bagged into one-ounce lots (Count 2). A commercial quantity of cocaine is 250 grams and a large commercial quantity is one kilogram. 

61In the front bedroom of the house, police located a ""Fitness First"" sports bag which was closed with a zipper and locked with a padlock. That padlock was opened by the same key as opened the padlock on the Gant duffle bag which contained MDMA tablets (see [48] above). Within the ""Fitness First"" sports bag, was a smaller ""Fitness First"" toiletries bag. 

62The toiletries bag contained a plastic freezer bag, which held a further five knotted plastic freezer bags. Each bag contained some 27.86 grams (one ounce) of cocaine, with a total weight of 139.7 grams. 

63The toiletries bag also contained a large resealable plastic bag which contained a further three bags of cocaine, each of which weighed about one ounce, with a total amount of 83.5 grams of cocaine. 

64Located as well within the toiletries bag was a brown paper bag which contained three plastic resealable bags. Each plastic bag contained three bags of cocaine, each weighing about one ounce. There was a total amount of 83.6 grams of cocaine in the paper bag, with a purity of 48.5%. 

65In addition, the drawer of the coffee table in the lounge room contained one plastic resealable bag of cocaine weighing 28.5 grams. 

The Hydraulic Compressor and Ram 

66In the courtyard at the rear of the Applicant's house, police located a hydraulic compressor and ram. 

67In the front bedroom, police located a plastic tub which contained three pieces of trimmed pine timber, a steel-based plate, a steel box section and a steel pressing plate. These timber and metal pieces fitted together with the hydraulic ram. 

68Senior Constable Christopher Burston, a police officer with extensive engineering qualifications and experience, examined these items. He said that they had been constructed with a high degree of accuracy. He expressed the opinion that the timber fitted between the metal plates to offer more protection to the item being compressed. He stated that it was an assembly used to compress a substance into a hardened brick-like object. Analytical testing revealed traces of cocaine on the one piece of wood which was examined. 

69Detective Senior Constable Jayson Heyward, from the Chemical Operations Unit of the State Crime Command Drug Squad, expressed the opinion that the press would have been used to compress cocaine, heroin or cannabis into blocks. He stated that presses such as this ""are not normally seen at street level but more reserved for middle to high level drug syndicates"" . 

Cutting and Binding Agents 

70Police located several large bags of substances, which were capable of being used as cutting agents, in the Applicant's house. They were as follows: 

(a) in a kitchen cupboard, two plastic bags labelled ""whey"" , weighing 1.99 kilograms - analysed as mannitol; 

(b) in a kitchen cupboard, a further two plastic bags labelled ""whey"" , weighing two kilograms - analysed as mannitol; 

(c) in a kitchen cupboard, a large plastic resealable bag containing three plastic resealable bags, all found within a bag labelled ""whey"" - analysed as mannitol in an amount of two kilograms; 

(d) in a kitchen cupboard, a Glad resealable plastic bag containing 13.4 grams of sodium bicarbonate; 

(e) in a kitchen cupboard over the fridge, a plastic bag containing 382.8 grams of dimethyl sulfone; 

(f) in a kitchen cupboard, a bag containing 857.6 grams of mannitol. 

71Detective Senior Constable Heyward stated that the cutting agents found in the house could be combined with any of the powdered drugs found on the premises. 

72Detective Senior Constable Heyward observed that the presence of the press, the location of cocaine on a piece of wood used within that press, the cutting and binding agents found in the house and the large amount of cocaine found in the house led him to the opinion that the press had been used to compress cocaine into blocks. 

73In total, police located 335.3 grams of cocaine in the Applicant's house. 

74Detective Senior Constable Heyward analysed the substances referred to at [70] above. He stated that dimethyl sulfone is available commercially as a dietary supplement for animals. It is used as a bulking or cutting agent, that is an agent used to dilute the purity of a prohibited drug and increase the total weight of the mixed drug. He stated that it is also used as a binding agent in that it assists ""with the adhesion of a compound when it is placed under pressure, subsequently resulting in a solid brick like compound being formed"" . 

75Detective Senior Constable Heyward stated that mannitol is used in preventing or treating excess body water in certain kidney conditions. He said that in the illegal drug world, he has frequently seen it used as a bulking or cutting agent, and as a binding agent. He said that use as a binding agent would be the most likely explanation for its presence in the Applicant's house. 

76He stated that sodium bicarbonate is available commercially over the counter. He had frequently seen it used as a bulking or cutting agent, more so than a binding agent, because of its physical properties. 

77He observed that all three products are readily available and are easily absorbed into the human body, with little effect on the human system. Accordingly, they are ideal for use in drug manufacture. The substances will not mask the active (prohibited) drug with which they are mixed when consumed by the user. 

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances 

78The Applicant was born in May 1974 and was aged between 33 and 34 years at the time of the offences. He was 35 years' old at the time of sentence. 

79The Applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. In a number of respects, his evidence was unsatisfactory. His Honour made several findings arising from the Applicant's evidence, some of which were unfavourable to the Applicant. 

80The Applicant had lived with his parents and siblings, leaving school in Year 9 when aged 15 years. He then worked as a deckhand with Sydney Ferries for 15 years. After leaving Sydney Ferries, the Applicant worked as a roofer. 

81There was no presentence report or other form of report (such as a psychological or psychiatric report) tendered in the sentencing proceedings. 

82A number of references were tendered which confirmed the Applicant's prior employment as a deckhand with Sydney Ferries. 

83The Applicant said that he commenced to use ice in the period of 12-18 months before his arrest in May 2008. 

84The Applicant had a prior criminal history for serious driving offences, including drive manner dangerous (June 1996), drive with mid-range PCA (August 2002), drive with mid-range PCA (November 2002), driving whilst disqualified (three counts) (April 2004), driving whilst disqualified (September 2004) and driving whilst disqualified (March 2006). 

85The driving whilst disqualified offences dealt with in April 2004 led to the imposition of good behaviour bonds requiring the Applicant to accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service, and to accept counselling for the purpose of drug and alcohol rehabilitation. A suspended sentence was imposed upon similar terms. 

86Penalties of escalating severity were imposed thereafter for the Applicant's recidivism with respect to driving whilst disqualified, with a community service order being granted in September 2004 and then a sentence of full-time imprisonment imposed in March 2006, varied in May 2006 at the Parramatta District Court to a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. 

87It appears that the Applicant did not comply with the terms of his periodic detention. In January 2007, the State Parole Authority revoked his periodic detention and directed that he serve imprisonment for a period of five months commencing in June 2007 and expiring in November 2007, with a non-parole period expiring on 21 August 2007. 

Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge 

88The District Court sentencing hearing was of relatively brief duration. After the Applicant gave evidence, comparatively short submissions were made by counsel for the Applicant (who did not appear in this Court) and by the Prosecutor. The sentencing Judge proceeded to sentence the Applicant later that day, after taking an adjournment to reflect upon the question of sentence. 

89Given certain submissions made in this Court, it is useful to set out several of his Honour's findings, commencing with the opening comments in his remarks on sentence. His Honour said: R v Paxton [2009] NSWDC 326 at [1]-[2]: 

""1 HIS HONOUR: Mark Allan Paxton appears to be sentenced after having supplied enormous quantities of drugs, quantities rarely seen in the courts. Overall he supplied about eight and a half kilograms of ecstasy, 335 grams of cocaine, 2.3 kilograms of methylamphetamine, almost half a kilo of an admixture of heroin, and almost 6 kilograms of cannabis. Those figures alone show the enormous extent of Mr Paxton's criminality. 

2 In looking at the appropriate sentence to impose upon him there is not much assistance that can be gained from other cases due to the fortunate rarity of offending of this extent. The Crown referred me to the case of R v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152, and also the case of Regina v Walsh and Little [2005] NSWSC 125 who supplied and manufactured drugs, and more than Mr Paxton was involved in. But it is to be remembered that they were all dealt with before the introduction of standard non-parole periods, a significant factor affecting the sentences I will ultimately announce on Mr Paxton."" 

90His Honour summarised the facts of the case and adverted to the applicable maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods. His Honour observed (at ROS [5]): 

""It is not an exaggeration to say that the offender appears to have been able to supply large quantities of whatever drug was sought. He was operating, in effect, a one-stop shop."" 

91The sentencing Judge referred to the Applicant's subjective circumstances, before moving to make findings concerning his involvement in these substantial crimes. His Honour said at ROS [23]-[26]: 

""23 The offender had an unremarkable upbringing. He lived with his parents, his brother and his sister. He left school at fifteen, halfway through Year 9, and then spent fifteen years working as a deckhand on Sydney ferries. Three ferry captains have provided references in support of the offender's good character at that time. They say things such as: 

'When I received the information regarding Mark and the charges I was bewildered and saddened that Mark would be involved in such activities. I find this out of character.' 

24 The three ferry masters are no doubt shocked at what they have learnt about the offender's substantial wrongdoing. 

25 After the offender left Sydney Ferries he worked roofing for a while and then whilst living in Redfern started using ice. This was a year or a year and a half before his arrest. It was not long before he was addicted and got into debt because he was using ice every day to deal with his depression but unable to work because a friend of his whom he relied on for transport lost his licence. He accumulated a fairly modest debt of $5,000 or $6,000 and was told by his drug suppliers who had been supplying him on credit that he could pay off that debt by assisting them in their drug supply activities. He says this went on for four or five months until he was arrested. 

26 The offender tried to minimise the extent of his criminality by saying that all that he was really doing was providing a house for the drugs to be left at. He said that, 'They would leave stuff at my house.' This significantly understates the offender's conduct. He provided much more than simply premises. It was his job, which he seems to have enthusiastically accepted, to sell the drugs. He was tasked with much more than providing the premises. He was a drug dealer, not simply a drug minder."" 

92His Honour stated (at ROS [27]) that he would allow a 20% discount for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty. 

93The sentencing Judge then referred to the offences which carried standard non-parole periods, and said at ROS [28]-[32]: 

""28 I mentioned that three of the offences have standard non-parole periods. Of course, they are not of direct application because of the offender's pleas of guilty but they remain as a guidepost. I am satisfied that the offence involving ecstasy is in the upper range of objective seriousness of offences of that type. The quantity involved, seventeen times the large commercial quantity, is all that really needs to be referred to as justifying that finding. 

29 As far as the other matters are concerned, I note that the methylamphetamine supply matter involved two and a half times the large commercial quantity, and so I find that objectively that is above the mid range. 

30 In relation to the remaining matter of supplying the cocaine, that is at the mid range. 

31 Of course, standard non-parole periods are difficult to apply when there must necessarily be partial accumulation. Nevertheless, as I have said, I have had regard to the standard non-parole periods as a guidepost. They indicate with some considerable force the attitude that the legislature takes to large scale drug supply offences. As I mentioned before, when a comparison is made between the overall sentence I will ultimately impose on Mr Paxton and other large scale drug suppliers or drug manufacturers dealt with before standard non-parole periods were introduced, it must be remembered that it was the clear intention of the legislature that sentences for standard non-parole period matters would increase as a result of the change in the law. 

32 Let me say something in general about why the legislature has responded in the way it has to offences of this kind. The extent to which the community suffers through offences of this type cannot really be underestimated. Those of us who have been involved in the criminal law for many years understand the close relationship between a large proportion of offending and drug use, drug addiction and drug supply. There is barely a person appearing for sentence for a charge of armed robbery, break enter and steal, or even shoplifting who does not say that their need for money arose out of their need to fund their addiction. All of us suffer because of offences committed by people like the offender, not just those who become addicted to drugs."" 

94His Honour returned to the Applicant's evidence (at ROS [34]-[35]): 

""34 The offender gave evidence. The Crown asked him to name other people involved in the operation and he refused to do so because he said that he was in fear of his life and was worried for the safety of his family. I want to make it clear that the offender is not to be punished for the attitude he took. It simply means that he does not get a discount. It also perhaps means that any finding of remorse might have been harder to make but, in any case, there was no evidence of any remorse expressed by the offender, at least as far as s 21A is concerned. 

35 The offender said that he went into this so that he could pay off his debt. Whether or not that was initially the case, it is clear that the offender adopted his role enthusiastically. I do not accept on the balance of probabilities that the offender was going to stop once he had paid his debt off. The offender agreed that he was not living a life of poverty. If the offender's sole motivation had been to pay off the debt, one might have expected that he would have taken other steps to have reduced the debt apart from simply supplying drugs. The offender did this for financial gain in any case. It may not have been the case where he was a non-user dealer involved in this operation only because of the financial reward it could bring him, but it was nevertheless a financial gain to him to be able to pay off his debt."" 

95Before passing sentence, his Honour said at ROS [36]: 

""It is never a pleasant task to impose a lengthy sentence on someone as young as Mr Paxton but it is necessary to do so. General deterrence is of prime importance in cases of this kind. The money involved in drug supplying provides a powerful incentive for potential drug suppliers to put to one side any qualms they might have about the harm they are causing individual drug users and the community in general. Offenders like Mr Paxton must understand that if they choose to involve themselves in drug supply, especially to the extent that Mr Paxton did, they will go to gaol for a very long time. The ability of courts to respond when offences of this kind are detected is limited. The courts have rather blunt tools, but they must use them when they can in order to perform the ultimate function of protecting the society in which we live. For this reason, very lengthy sentences will now be imposed upon Mr Paxton."" 
 
Grounds 1 and 2 - Grounds Asserting Errors in Characterisation or Identification of Objective Seriousness of Drug Supply Offences Which Attracted Standard Non-Parole Periods (Counts 1-3) 

96It is convenient to deal with Grounds 1 and 2 together, as those grounds concern the characterisation or proper identification of the objective seriousness of the drug supply offences which carried standard non-parole periods. 

Submissions for the Applicant 

97Mr Boulten SC, for the Applicant, submitted that, in finding that the first count lay in the ""upper range of objective seriousness of offences of that type"" , the quantity of the drug was treated as the prime, if not the only, consideration grounding the finding. He submitted that a similar approach had been taken with respect to the third count which was found objectively to be ""above the mid range"" . 

98Mr Boulten SC submitted that reliance on quantity of a drug as the prime factor in fixing sentence involved error, relying upon Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 609 [70] and Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 373 [33]. 

99Senior counsel for the Applicant developed this submission, contending that error was demonstrated by the sentencing Judge's treatment (in ROS [2], [31] at [89] and [93] above) of the decisions in R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2; 111 A Crim R 152 and R v Walsh and Little [2005] NSWSC 125. He submitted that both R v Kalache and R v Walsh and Little involved a significantly higher level of criminality than the case of the Applicant. Mr Kalache was found to be the principal and co-ordinator of a drug supply operation (unlike the Applicant) and his offences involved quantities which, in total, were more than double those involved in the Applicant's case. Further, Mr Kalache was not, at any relevant time, a user of drugs and he had previous convictions for supplying a prohibited drug and was, as well, in breach of parole. 

100It was submitted that the offences of Mr Walsh involved larger quantities of drugs and also offences involving weapons and the destruction of property, so that the circumstances of his case were different from those of the Applicant. 

101It was observed that the sentencing Judge had found (in ROS [26] at [91] above) that the Applicant was a drug dealer, and not simply a drug minder, and that no finding had been made that he was a principal or higher ranking operator in a drug-dealing enterprise. 

102It was submitted that, in any event, the evidence could not justify a finding that the Applicant was a higher-ranking operator. No evidence of wealth commensurate with someone enjoying the proceeds of large-scale drug dealing was presented. The sentencing Judge accepted the Applicant's indebtedness, together with the finding that dealing was his job, rather than him being a principal of a dealing operation. It was submitted that this suggested that the Applicant was not high in the hierarchy of suppliers, notwithstanding the amount of drugs he held on his premises. 

103Mr Boulten SC submitted that it was not apparent in the remarks on sentence as to what his Honour considered a mid-range offence to be. Senior counsel contended that any mid-range large commercial quantity supply offence will involve a large amount of drugs, and that there is no upper limit on the amount of drugs which can constitute a large commercial quantity. Accordingly, he submitted that the utility in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence in terms of multiples of the threshold of the offence was limited. 

104Mr Boulten SC submitted that the usual mid-range large commercial quantity supply will involve some evidence of involvement in a syndicate, or the possession of tools to process drugs, or some other like matter simply by virtue of the amounts involved. It was only at the lower end of objective seriousness (for example, couriers), where such evidence would not be present. 

105Putting aside the quantities, Mr Boulten SC submitted that there was little that takes the Applicant's circumstances beyond the middle range. He was found to be a drug dealer, but this was an inevitable finding. He submitted that there must be further identified factors to establish a finding above that range and that quantity alone, particularly when considering offences which necessarily involve large quantities, cannot be enough to raise an offence above the mid-range. 

106With respect to the second count, Mr Boulten SC submitted that his Honour had fallen into error in finding that the offence was ""at the mid range"" without revealing any analysis for this conclusion. 

107When regard was had to the Applicant's role, the quantities of drugs and the purity of the drugs, Mr Boulten SC submitted that the sentencing Judge had erroneously overstated the objective seriousness of each of the offences contained in the first, second and third counts. 

108In support of the second ground of appeal, Mr Boulten SC submitted that his Honour had erred in finding that the offence contained in the third count lay objectively ""above the mid range"" , without specifying where in the range the offence fell. Reliance was placed upon R v Sellars [2010] NSWCCA 133 at [11]. In any event, Mr Boulten SC submitted that this offence did not fall above the mid-range at all or, alternatively, the offence was not high in the range of objective seriousness. 

Crown Submissions 

109With respect to the first ground of appeal, the Crown emphasised the caution adopted by this Court when asked to overturn a discretionary finding characterising the degree of objective seriousness of an offence: R Mulato [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]. 

110The Crown submitted that it was pertinent to observe that no submission had been made on behalf of the Applicant in the District Court concerning the objective seriousness of these offences. 

111The Crown accepted that an offender's role in a drug syndicate, and the level of criminality involved, is more important in determining the sentence than the quantity of drugs involved, the latter being neither the sole or even principal determinant: R v MacDonnell [2002] NSWCCA 34; 128 A Crim R 44 at 50 [33]; Melikian v R [2008] NSWCCA 156 at [42]. However, the quantity of the drug remains material, given that the size of the profit and the harm inflicted are likely to be proportional to the weight of the drug: R v Stanbouli [2003] NSWCCA 355; 141 A Crim R 531 at 550 [102]. 

112The Crown submitted as well, that while a non-principal will normally be dealt with as being less objectively culpable than a principal in a drug supply offence, it does not follow that a non-principal will receive, as of course, a dramatically more lenient sentence: R v Giammaria [2006] NSWCCA 63 at [15]. 

113The Crown submitted that his Honour's findings that the first count was in the upper range, the second count at the mid-range and the third count above the mid-range were well open to the sentencing Judge. 

114The Crown contended that the following features of the Applicant's conduct were common to each count, and supported a finding of at least mid-range objective seriousness for each offence. 

115Firstly, the Applicant was engaged in the regular and reliable supply of drugs. This was a sophisticated operation where the Applicant could access virtually any type of drug, in any quantity, at very short notice. 

116Secondly, the Applicant was dealing for financial gain. The sentencing Judge expressly rejected the Applicant's suggestion that he was supplying drugs only to pay off his debt. The Crown submitted that, when the insignificant size of the debt is compared to the scale of the dealing, the Applicant's evidence seems ludicrous. 

117Thirdly, the Applicant had a wide range of drugs for sale, and the greater the range of drugs a dealer offers for sale, the greater the criminality: R v Fisher [2008] NSWCCA 102 at [31]. 

118Fourthly, the Applicant was involved in the cutting, bulking and packaging of the drugs and the negotiation of prices. The presence of the hydraulic press indicated that the Applicant prepared the drugs for sale. 

119Fifthly, the Applicant was more than a mere warehouser or even salesman. He negotiated discounts for bulk sales and was a proactive participant in organising sales. Given the huge quantity of drugs which he had, and the ease and speed with which he could obtain them, the Crown contended that the Applicant was very close to the principals in the syndicate. 

120In addition to the features of the offending common to all three supply charges, the Crown submitted that the feature of the first count that takes it to the upper range of objective criminality is the quantity of the drugs (17 times the large commercial quantity of MDMA), with the quantity and range of drugs made available for supply being clearly relevant to the assessment of objective criminality. 

121The Crown submitted that the features of the third count which took it above the mid-range of objective seriousness are the amount of drugs involved (two-and-a-half times the large commercial quantity for methylamphetamine) and the number of separate instances of supply that constitute this offence: Kwon v R [2011] NSWCCA 58 at [32]. 

122Further, the Crown submitted that the fact that most of the drugs were seized by police before being distributed did not reduce the Applicant's objective criminality: R v Gao and Lim [2007] NSWCCA 343 at [18]ff; Kwon v R at [34]-[35]. 

123The Crown did not make any separate submission concerning the Applicant's argument that error was disclosed in the conclusion, without analysis, that the second count lay at the mid-range. 

124The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge's findings on objective seriousness were open to him and should not be disturbed. 

Decision Concerning Grounds 1 and 2 

125In approaching these grounds of appeal, it is necessary to read fairly the entirety of his Honour's remarks on sentence. A practical approach should be taken by this Court in assessing remarks on sentence, with an emphasis upon substance (and the resulting sentence) and not just matters of form: Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [51]. An assessment of objective seriousness is appropriate, although this does not require an elaborate verbal formula: Corby v R at [50]. 

126In addition, it is necessary to keep in mind that the characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing Judge in performing the task of finding facts, and drawing inferences from those facts, so that this Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first-instance Judge exercising a broadly based discretion: R v Mulato at [37]. The question is whether the particular characterisation of the objective seriousness of an offence was open to the sentencing Judge. 

127The DMT Act adopts a type of quantity-based penalty regime by fixing quantities (including commercial and large commercial quantities) of certain drugs, distinguishing between those drugs in setting such quantities, but otherwise making no distinction between them in terms of maximum penalties. The position is broadly analogous to that taken with importation and possession offences contained in the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) : Adams v The Queen [2008] HCA 15, 234 CLR 143 at 146 [2]. 

128However, there are at least two significant distinguishing features as between the Commonwealth and New South Wales statutory schemes. Firstly, the New South Wales statutory scheme incorporates standard non-parole periods for offences of supplying a commercial or large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. There is no corresponding provision in Commonwealth law. 

129Secondly, Division 314 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) lists the applicable trafficable, marketable and commercial quantities for each type of drug, with the specified quantities based on the pure amount of the drug. However, s.4 DMT Act provides that ""a reference to a prohibited drug includes a reference to any preparation, admixture, extract or other substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug"" . Accordingly, under New South Wales law, it is the total quantity of the substance (containing any proportion of a prohibited drug) which is pertinent for the purpose of classification of the offence. Nevertheless, purity of the drug is one of the factors to be considered when determining where an offence falls in the range of objective seriousness: R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78; 152 A Crim R 462 at 472 [56]. 

130In relation to Commonwealth drug importation offences, it has been said that, although the weight of the drug imported is not the principal factor to be considered when fixing sentence, the size of the importation is a relevant factor and has increased significance when the offender is aware of the amount of drugs imported: Wong v The Queen at 607-608 [64]; R v Lee [2007] NSWCCA 234 at [23]-[24]. 

131Further, the statements by the High Court in Wong v The Queen do not suggest that, in an appropriate case, the amount of the drug involved in an importation is not a highly relevant factor in determining the objective seriousness of the offence, even to the extent of assessing that a particular offence is in the worst category of its type. In many cases, the only factor that would lead to a determination that one importation is worse than another would be the amount of drug involved, where otherwise the circumstances of the importation were the same or very similar: R v Nguyen [2005] NSWCCA 362; 157 A Crim R 80 at 102 [110]; R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R at 237 [72](e). 

132Although the propositions referred to at [130] and [131] relate to Commonwealth importation offences, the reasoning is readily applicable to New South Wales drug supply offences as well. Where the structure of the Act involves a quantity-based penalty regime, with maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods escalating as the quantity of the relevant drug crosses from one quantum-based category into another, it is understandable that the quantity of drugs remains a very material consideration in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence. The decisions of this Court in R v MacDonnell , R v Stanbouli and Melikian v R are consistent with these propositions. 

133I do not interpret the statements of the sentencing Judge at ROS [28]-[29] (see [93] above) as confining attention solely to the quantities of the drugs for the purpose of making findings concerning the objective seriousness of the first and third counts. His Honour made findings elsewhere in the remarks on sentence concerning the role of the Applicant in the supply of drugs, incorporating the conduct falling within the first and third counts. As mentioned, it is necessary to read fairly the entirety of the remarks on sentence in considering this ground. 

134I accept the submissions of the Crown (at [114]-[119] above) concerning the overlapping conduct of the Applicant, which is common to all three counts. It would be artificial to narrowly consider the facts which relate exclusively to each of the three counts in determining the role of the Applicant in these drug supply offences. The overlapping conduct of the Applicant ought be considered, in conjunction with the evidence concerning the quantities of each of the three types of drugs in question. Of course, it is necessary to guard against any impermissible aggravating finding as a result of consideration of factors common to the three offences. 

135An assessment of the Applicant's role is not to be determined by the selection of a label which might properly attach to him. As with a person to be sentenced for a Commonwealth importation offence, the criminality of a New South Wales drug supply offender ought be assessed by consideration of the involvement of the offender in the steps taken to effect the drug supply offences. Problems may emerge when a sentencing court attempts to categorise the role of the offender in the drug enterprise as, in many cases, the full nature and extent of the enterprise is unlikely to be known to the Court: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 279 [19]. 

136In the present case, although the Applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing, he sought to distance himself from the multitude of drugs, and the items of stolen jewellery, located in his house. He declined to give any meaningful evidence concerning the identity and roles of others involved in the drug supply enterprise (T15, 6 November 2009). It is understandable that the sentencing Judge took a circumspect approach in assessing the Applicant's evidence. He made few concessions against interest and, in significant areas, sought to deny (or at least not accept) the undeniable. 

137In my view, the Agreed Statement of Facts disclosed a state of affairs which permitted the following conclusions. 

138The Applicant was the sole occupant of the Balmain premises in the relevant period between March and May 2008. As the detailed description set out above reveals, located at various points throughout the house were different drugs, packaged mainly in quantities designed for supply to other suppliers, including sample bags. The Applicant negotiated with Burnett concerning price, and took opportunities (when Burnett was present in the house) to offer other drugs, and stolen jewellery, for sale. 

139Also located in the premises were items of equipment which ought be concluded were the paraphernalia of a substantial drug supplier. There is no credible evidence of other persons attending the premises for the purpose of using this equipment to cut drugs. Further, cutting agents were located in different cupboards in the house occupied by the Applicant, and used by him as a residence. The appropriate inference is that the Applicant utilised the cutting agents and the equipment as part of his multipurpose activity in the preparation, negotiation and sale of prohibited drugs. 

140Although the Applicant contended in evidence that he was working off a debt (in the order of $5,000.00-$6,000.00) in performing drug supply duties from the Balmain house, that assertion did not line up credibly with all the known facts. As with all drug suppliers, it was necessary for the Applicant to source prohibited drugs from others. The nature of the operation revealed in the evidence, as conducted from the Balmain premises, did not suggest that he was a mere functionary on behalf of others. As the Crown submitted, he was no mere warehouseman or salesman. Rather, the Applicant acted in an entrepreneurial way, conducting a type of drug convenience store or supermarket, where a range of drugs were available for sale. The Applicant was prepared to offer other types of drugs for sale, no doubt secure in the knowledge that he had ready supplies of the range of drugs. The packaging and labelling of bags containing drugs pointed to a systematic operation, with the Applicant, at one point, utilising a form of ledger in recording a drug debt. 

141There were variations in the purity of the drugs, an issue relevant to an assessment of objective seriousness (see [129] above). Some care is required in drawing conclusions by reference to evidence of purity: R v Attallah [2005] NSWCCA 277 at [221]; Ma v R [2007] NSWCCA 240 at [50]-[55]. 

142The first count involved 38,700 tablets of MDMA (ecstasy). It might be expected that the tablets would be on-sold to end users in that tablet form, so that purity levels were not as significant. To the extent that it is known, the purity levels of these tablets appeared to be in a range of 31%-33% (see [49]-[52] above). 

143The second count involved bagged cocaine, with one portion having a purity of 48.5% (see [64] above). 

144The third count reveals the supply of methylamphetamine with purity levels between 3.5% (at [43] above) and 71% (at [36] above). 

145The commercial heroin supply Form 1 offence involved an admixture with a heroin purity of 4.5%, a low purity level which contributed to the offence being dealt with on a Form 1 (see [40] above). 

146I have kept in mind Mr Boulten SC's submission that particular care is required in the assessment of objective seriousness of a large commercial quantity supply offence. The presence of cutting and binding agents and equipment such as the hydraulic compressor and ram may be more likely in a large commercial quantity case, because of the quantity of drugs involved and the intermediate stage of supply, usually at the wholesale level. There may be evidence of substantial wealth, and trappings of wealth, on the part of principals engaged in large-scale drug supply. 

147Here, the sentencing Judge accepted that the Applicant was a drug user. His Honour left open the question whether a relatively small drug debt led the Applicant into this activity, finding that he adopted his drug-dealing role ""enthusiastically"" and that he was not going to stop when the debt was paid off (at ROS [35] at [94] above). These findings were open to the sentencing Judge. 

148Having considered the submissions of the parties, I am persuaded that it was not open to the sentencing Judge to find that the first count lay in the upper range of seriousness for offences of this type. In reaching this conclusion, I have had particular regard to the quantity of the drug and the role of the Applicant. The quantity was some 17 times the large commercial quantity. However, the relevant large commercial quantity commences at 500 grams and has no upper limit. This is pertinent to an assessment of objective gravity. The Applicant operated the drug supply business from the Balmain premises. The evidence did not indicate that he employed others as part of the business. The evidence did not indicate a limited financial return to the Applicant, but it did not point either to the trappings of wealth frequently associated with drug syndicate principals. In my view, the evidence did not permit a finding that the offence lay more than moderately above the middle range of objective seriousness, at a point clearly below the upper range. 

149It was open to the sentencing Judge to find that the second count lay at the mid-range. 

150With respect to the second ground of appeal concerning the third count, the finding that the offence lay above the mid-range lacks precision. However, I am satisfied that the appropriate finding was that the offence lay slightly above the mid-range and that this is the way in which his Honour approached sentence on this count. 

151I am not persuaded that the sentencing Judge's reference to the decisions in R v Kalache and R v Walsh and Little (see [89] and [93] above) demonstrates error. I take his Honour's comments to mean that these earlier cases were examples of large-scale drug supply offenders at a time before the commencement of the standard non-parole period system. His Honour was not utilising the sentences imposed in those cases as representing a comparable benchmark, which was to be moved upwards because of the introduction of the standard non-parole period system, in their application to the Applicant's case. His Honour was alive to the differences in quantity of drugs involved in those decisions to the quantities which applied to the Applicant's case. 

152The sentencing Judge's point was that the Applicant's case represented a very serious example of a person involved in the supply of prohibited drugs, in various forms and substantial quantities. It was clear that the Applicant was to be sentenced for his offences after an assessment of all relevant factors, including the standard non-parole periods which applied as guideposts on sentence. I do not think that the Applicant gains support for his grounds of appeal from the sentencing Judge's references to these earlier sentencing decisions. 

153The Applicant has demonstrated error concerning the first count, but not the second count, under the first ground of appeal. The third count is the subject of complaint under the first and second grounds. It is apparent that his Honour approached the matter upon the basis that the third count lay slightly above the mid-range, a view that was clearly open. 

154The consequences of these findings will be considered later in this judgment. 

Ground 3 - Failure to Set Non-Parole Periods for the Second and Third Counts 

Submissions 

155Mr Boulten SC submitted that his Honour fell into error in imposing fixed terms of imprisonment for the second and third counts, contrary to s.45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

156The Crown accepted that these sentences involved errors of law. However, the Crown submitted that the appropriate course was to treat the fixed term selected by his Honour in each case as the non-parole period, for the purpose of imposing substitute sentences which complied with the law and reflected the intention of the sentencing Judge. 

157Mr Boulten SC submitted that such an approach would be wrong in this case as sentences of that length would be excessive. He contended that lesser sentences of imprisonment ought be fixed for those offences. 

Decision 

158It is common ground that the fixed-term sentences imposed on the second and third counts involved error as these were standard non-parole period offences, and a sentencing court cannot decline to set a non-parole period for those offences: s.45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . Fixed-term sentences are not available for standard non-parole offences: R v Way at 179 [47]; Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 at [7], [64]-[65]. 

159As the ground of appeal correctly alleges error in this respect, it is appropriate for this Court to intervene so that the Applicant is sentenced according to law on these counts. 

160This Court has observed that a fixed term of imprisonment reflects the non-parole period component of a sentence: R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 346 at [161]; Hristovski v R at [65]. Applying this approach, if the Court otherwise rejects the Applicant's remaining grounds of appeal, the appropriate course would be, as the Crown submits, to substitute sentences of imprisonment on the second and third counts which comprise a non-parole period and a balance of term. If the non-parole period reflects the fixed term imposed in the District Court, then the result will be the imposition of a longer sentence of imprisonment on each of these counts. This course is available in an appropriate case under s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 : Aguirre v R [2010] NSWCCA 115 at [31]-[36]; Hristovski v R at [65]. 

161It is appropriate to record the conclusion that the Applicant has made good the third ground of appeal. The question of what sentences ought be imposed in substitution for these erroneous sentences should await an assessment of the remaining grounds of appeal. 

Grounds 4 and 5 - The Individual Sentences and the Total Effective Sentence are Manifestly Excessive 

162It is convenient to deal with these grounds of appeal together. Although I have upheld the first ground of appeal with respect to the first count, and the third ground of appeal, it will be of assistance to set out and consider the arguments concerning Grounds 4 and 5. 

Submissions for the Applicant 

163Mr Boulten SC submitted that the sentence imposed on the first count involved a total term of imprisonment for 23 years with a non-parole period of 16 years. Allowing for a 20% discount for the Applicant's plea of guilty, the notional starting point of the head sentence was about 27 years and seven months and a non-parole period, in accordance with the statutory ratio, would be about 20 years and seven months. On this approach, Mr Boulten SC observed that the starting point non-parole period was more than five years longer than the standard non-parole period for this offence. 

164Mr Boulten SC submitted that a number of cases have now come to be considered by this Court in relation to the large commercial supply of MDMA, with a convenient summary of many of these cases being contained in Tan v R [2010] NSWCCA 207 at [21]-[33]. Mr Boulten SC pointed to the sentence imposed on the offender in Tan v R and upon other offenders in R v Nikolic [2007] NSWCCA 232 and R v Gao and Lim [2007] NSWCCA 343. 

165Reliance was also placed upon R v Stricke [2007] NSWCCA 179, a Crown appeal against sentence for large commercial supply of MDMA. 

166With respect to the third count, Mr Boulten SC submitted that the decisions of this Court in Ly v R [2008] NSWCCA 262 and Vigo v R [2009] NSWCCA 98 supported the contention that the sentence imposed on the third count was manifestly excessive. 

167With respect to the second count, Mr Boulten SC observed that a fixed term of eight years' imprisonment had been set where the standard non-parole period was 10 years and the maximum penalty 20 years' imprisonment. Mr Boulten SC submitted that it would appear that his Honour deducted the 20% discount for the plea from the standard non-parole period of 10 years, resulting in a fixed term of eight years. If this is what occurred, it was submitted that no benefit had been provided to the Applicant for his lack of prior convictions or his subjective case. It was submitted that the penalty for this offence was manifestly excessive. 

168In support of the fifth ground of appeal, Mr Boulten SC submitted that an examination of the cases referred to, including Tan v R and R v Nikolic , indicated that the total sentence imposed upon the Applicant for these offences fell above that appropriate for a person not found to be in the highest range of offenders. 

169Mr Boulten SC submitted that the Applicant, now 36 years of age, will not be eligible for release until he is 56 years of age. It was submitted that the total sentence imposed on him is crushing in all the circumstances. 

170Whilst a maximum penalty of life imprisonment was available to the Court, Mr Boulten SC submitted that his Honour did not impose it, nor would he have been justified in doing so. He submitted that the sentence imposed approaches the point at which it is distinguishable only in theory from a life sentence, in the sense discussed in R v Folbigg [2005] NSWCCA 23; 152 A Crim R 35 at 87 [190]. Absent a finding that the Applicant approached the worst class of offenders, it was submitted that the total sentence must be excessive. 

171Mr Boulten SC submitted that there was no discussion of totality of the remarks on sentence. Whilst the sentences imposed do contain a measure of concurrence, he submitted that, taken as a whole, the length of the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 

Crown Submissions 

172The Crown submitted that it had not been demonstrated that the sentences, viewed individually or collectively, were manifestly excessive. 

173It was submitted that the appropriate way to consider any submission about manifest excess is to gather the salient facts of the case, and to then assess them by reference to the maximum applicable sentence and the standard non-parole period: Wong v R [2010] NSWCCA 160 at [14]. Here the maximum sentence on the first and third counts was life imprisonment with a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment on the second count. 

174With respect to the Applicant's reliance upon other cases in support of the claim of manifest excess, the Crown submits that there is real difficulty with comparisons with other sentencing decisions in support of an argument of manifest excess, in particular where those decisions are relatively few and were not referred to at first instance: Stock v R [2011] NSWCCA 49 at [42]. 

175The Crown accepted that the sentences imposed upon the Applicant are lengthy, and are towards the upper end of the range of sentences imposed for offences of this kind. However, the Crown submits that the range of sentences properly available for these offences was not determined by consideration of other cases or Judicial Commission statistics, but by consideration of the facts by reference to the maximum penalty and, where appropriate, the standard non-parole period. 

176The Crown submits that it should also be borne in mind that the sentences imposed on the first and third counts took into account very serious offences on Forms 1. The sentences needed to reflect the totality of the criminality involved. 

177If the Court accepted that his Honour's findings as to objective seriousness were open, then the Crown submitted that the sentences imposed, whilst lengthy, cannot be regarded as manifestly excessive. 

178The Crown acknowledged that the non-parole period on the first count (which took into account one count of supplying more than the commercial quantity of heroin and one count of dealing with the proceeds of crime) must have taken, as a starting point, a period of 20 years and seven months. However, the Crown submitted that this reflected the fact that the offence was found to be in the upper range of objective seriousness, together with the two Form 1 offences. When viewed in the context of a standard non-parole period of 15 years and a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, it was submitted that this sentence is not manifestly excessive. 

179With respect to the third count (which took into account two counts of supplying an indictable quantity of cannabis), the Crown accepted that the starting point for the non-parole period of 12 years must have been a period of 15 years. The sentencing Judge had found this offence to be above the mid-range of objective seriousness, and the non-parole period ultimately imposed was three years less than the standard non-parole period for this offence. The Crown submitted that this was not manifestly excessive. 

180With respect to the second count, the Crown submitted that a starting point of 10 years, which was the standard non-parole period, was not manifestly excessive. 

181The Crown submitted that the decision whether or how to accumulate sentences involved the exercise of discretion, and that the degree of accumulation imposed by the sentencing Judge was appropriate given the number of discrete offences and different drugs involved: Stricke v R at [32]. 

182The Crown submitted that the quantity and range of drugs supplied by the Applicant were extremely serious, and that the findings of objective seriousness were well open to the sentencing Judge. 

183While the imposition of fixed terms on the second and third counts was erroneous, the Crown submitted that these periods were subsumed within the non-parole period on the first count, so that the Court should not intervene on those sentences. 

184The Crown submitted that no other less severe sentence is warranted in law, so that the appeal should be dismissed. 

The Concept of Manifest Excess 

185To establish a ground claiming manifest excess, it is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that the sentence under challenge is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen at 370-371 [27]. 

186It is, of course, a basic principle, that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. 

187Nor is appellate intervention on the ground of manifest excess justified simply because the result arrived at in the District Court is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where error is established in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 85 ALJR 195 at 207-208 [58]. 

Decision Concerning Ground 4 

188Ground 4 requires the Court to consider whether the sentence imposed on each count was manifestly excessive. Ground 5 involves an assessment whether the sentencing Judge's approach to accumulation and totality gave rise to a total effective sentence that was manifestly excessive. 

189I have found that his Honour erred in the assessment of objective seriousness of the first count. In these circumstances, I will reserve further consideration of this count until assessment of resentencing for this offence. 

190I have determined earlier in this judgment (at [150]) that, on the basis on which the matter was argued and dealt with, it was open to his Honour to find that the third count lay above the mid-range. On the basis on which the matter was dealt with below, I would place the offence slightly above the mid-range. This conclusion has been reached having regard to the Applicant's role, the quantity of the drug and its purity. 

191In approaching the question of sentence, it was also necessary to keep in mind the findings made concerning the Applicant's motive in becoming involved, and remaining involved, in the offence, these matters bearing upon the Applicant's moral culpability. 

192It may be taken that, before the 20% discount for the plea of guilty, his Honour assessed the matter as warranting a minimum term of imprisonment of 15 years. Upon the assumption the fixed term of 12 years' imprisonment may be taken as an effective non-parole period (if his Honour had imposed a non-parole period and a balance of term), then such a conclusion was open to the sentencing Judge having regard to the finding of the objective seriousness of this offence. 

193It is necessary to keep in mind that, in passing sentence on the third count, his Honour was asked to take into account (on a Form 1) two offences of supplying cannabis, being an actual supply of 3.149 kilograms, and a deemed supply of 2.673 kilograms. If these offences had been prosecuted separately on indictment, the maximum penalty for each offence would have been imprisonment for 10 years. 

194It was necessary for the Court to take into account the Form 1 matters with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the third count. The Court gives greater weight to personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences, when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given, when sentence is imposed for the primary offence: Attorney General's Application Under Section 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at 159 [42]. 

195Accordingly, assessment of penalty for this offence did not involve a sole focus upon the Applicant's activities in supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. 

196Further, the offence contained in the third count was committed over a period of two months, and involved a variety of acts on the part of the Applicant which gave rise to a very serious offence. 

197The Applicant's age, criminal history, subjective circumstances and prospects of rehabilitation were to be taken into account as well. They assisted the Applicant to an extent, but not to a substantial extent. 

198I am not persuaded that a sentence involving a non-parole period or minimum term of 12 years' imprisonment on the third count was unreasonable or plainly unjust. 

199I turn to the second count. I have found earlier in this judgment (at [149]) that it was open to the sentencing Judge to find that the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine lay at the mid-range. Once again, this conclusion has been reached having regard to the Applicant's role, the quantity of the drug and its purity. 

200Again, it is necessary to keep in mind the findings made concerning the Applicant's motive in becoming involved, and remaining involved, in the offence, these matters bearing upon the Applicant's moral culpability. 

201There are no Form 1 matters attaching to the second count. 

202Once again, the Applicant's age, criminal history, subjective circumstances and prospects of rehabilitation assist him, but not to a substantial extent. 

203In all the circumstances of the case, I am persuaded that the sentence imposed on the second count is manifestly excessive. In reaching this conclusion, I have had regard to all the objective and subjective factors bearing on sentence for this offence. The quantity of cocaine (335.3 grams) exceeded the commercial quantity (250 grams), but was a considerable distance from the large commercial quantity (one kilogram). The conclusions expressed at [148] above concerning the Applicant's role have similar application to this count. In due course, I will propose that the Applicant should be resentenced on this count. 

Decision Concerning Ground 5 

204Ground 5 complained of manifest excess by reference to issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality. As I propose that the Applicant ought be resentenced, it is not strictly necessary to resolve the ground by reference to the sentences passed in the District Court. However, these issues will arise again when resentencing the Applicant. It is useful to record a response to the submissions which have been made. 

205His Honour applied a measure of accumulation for the sentences on each of the four counts. The focus of argument in this Court has been directed to the sentences for the drug supply offences contained in the first, second and third counts. 

206It must not be overlooked, however, that there was an additional and significant crime contained in the fourth count, involving the receiving of a substantial quantity of stolen jewellery, which the Applicant was marketing as part of the commercial enterprise operated from the Balmain premises. No challenge has been made by the Applicant to the sentence imposed for that offence. The process of accumulation involved a period of imprisonment for one year being solely attributable to this offence. That course was well open to the sentencing Judge in the circumstances of this case. 

207The total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of 21 years with a balance of term of seven years. Of the minimum term of 21 years, a period of one year was solely referable to the fourth count, a period of two years was solely referable to the second count and a period of two years was solely referable to the third count. The non-parole period of 16 years for the first count commenced to run from 10 May 2013 following the period of five years attributable to the second, third and fourth counts. 

208The principles to be applied with respect to concurrency, accumulation and totality were stated by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27]: 

""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both."" 

209An assessment of these issues in the present case called for attention to the three serious drug supply offences, together with the further serious drug supply offences which required practical recognition on sentence for the Form 1 offences on the first and third counts. Although there was overlap between the various drug supply offences given the nature of the operations conducted by the Applicant from the Balmain premises, it remained the fact that there were serious supply offences relating to each of a number of different prohibited drugs. A level of accumulation was appropriate given the different offences and the different prohibited drugs involved in those offences: R v Stricke at [32]-[34]. 

210Mr Boulten SC submitted that his Honour did not refer expressly to the totality principle. It is apparent that his Honour had regard to relevant principles with respect to accumulation. I do not accept that the experienced sentencing Judge in this case failed to apply the totality principle. His Honour was well aware that a substantial sentence was being imposed, and his observations at ROS [36] (see [95] above) emphasise his Honour's consciousness of the impact of the total sentence to be imposed upon the Applicant. 

211Mr Boulten SC submitted that the total sentence upon the Applicant was crushing. He called in aid some observations made in R v Folbigg at 86-87 [187]-[190]. 

212The relationship between the totality principle and the concept of a ""crushing sentence"" was considered by this Court in R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at 164-165 [15]-[18], where Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ said: 

""15 ... Whenever the Court sentences an offender for multiple offences, including when there are different victims, or sentences an offender who is already serving a sentence after conviction for other offences, it is necessary for the judge to ensure that the aggregation of all of the sentences is a 'just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved': Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 307-308 per McHugh J. The need to maintain an appropriate relationship between the totality of the criminality involved in a series of offences and the totality of the sentences to be imposed for those offences arises for at least two reasons. 

16 The severity of a sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship. That is to say severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of a sentence. As Malcolm CJ said in R v Clinch (1994) 72 A Crim R 301 at 306: 

... the severity of a sentence increases at a greater rate than any increase in the length of the sentence. Thus, a sentence of five years is more than five times as severe as a sentence of one year. Similarly, while a sentence of seven years may be appropriate for one set of offences and a sentence of eight years my be appropriate for another set of offences, each looked at in isolation. Where both sets were committed by the one offender a sentence of 15 years may be out of proportion to the degree of criminality involved because of the compounding effect on the severity of the total sentence of simply aggregating the two sets of sentences. 


17 The second matter that is considered under the totality principle is the proposition that an extremely long total sentence may be 'crushing' upon the offender in the sense that it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release. This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there may be of rehabilitation and reform. Of course, in many cases of multiple offending, the offender may not be entitled to the element of mercy entailed in adopting such a constraint. 

18 A sentencing court must, however, take care when applying the totality principle. Public confidence in the administration of justice requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of a discount for multiple offending: R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 at [112]. For similar reasons in a case such as the present where an offender who is already serving other sentences comes to be sentenced for additional offences, the impression must not be given that no, or little, penalty is imposed for the additional offences."" 

213I do not take the observations of Sully J in R v Folbigg at 86-87 [187]-[190] as providing a principle which guides an assessment of a ""crushing sentence"" . In Ta'ala v R [2008] NSWCCA 132, Grove J (Campbell JA and myself agreeing) said at [40]-[42]: 

""40 Sully J added that a head sentence (as the total effectively was) of 40 years with a non parole period of 30 years was so 'crushing' as to manifest covert error. Although that offender was liable on each of four counts to a sentence of life imprisonment, it is self evident that the sentencing judge had determined that such sentences not be imposed. Sully J agreed with his reasons for so concluding. It scarcely needs to be said that if one were to engage in comparative descriptions, a life sentence would be more 'crushing' than any determinate sentence, at least if it is scheduled to expire before the attainment of anticipated life expectancy. 

41 It was observed in Folbigg that the situation of the individual offender was such as to lead to prediction that she may have been 66 to 76 years of age before she might be paroled. The appellant was born on 13 December 1981. 

42 Courts are not unfamiliar with descriptions of sentences as 'crushing' but that does not articulate some applicable test. A life sentence would presumably fall within the ambit of that description but the legitimacy of availability of a life sentence is not open to challenge. Whilst the language in Folbigg is general in terms it does not purport to, nor could it, detract from the well established principle that justice is individual and each offence and each offender requires assessment."" 

214The statements in Ta'ala v R at [42] have been applied by this Court: Barton v R [2009] NSWCCA 164 at [26]. 

215An assessment whether a particular sentence is a ""crushing sentence"" must have regard to the offence or offences committed by the offender, the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods relevant to those offences, and all objective and subjective factors which should be appropriately brought into account on sentence, together with principles concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality. As Grove J observed in Ta'ala v R at [42], ""justice is individual and each offence and each offender requires assessment"" . 

216It will be necessary to apply these principles concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality when resentencing the Applicant. 

Resentencing the Applicant 

217So far in this judgment, I have: 

(a) upheld the first ground of appeal concerning the first count - it was not open to the sentencing Judge to find that the offence lay in the upper range of objective seriousness of offences of this type; 

(b) upheld the third ground of appeal - the fixed-term sentences for the second and third counts were contrary to law and sentences comprising a non-parole period and a balance of term ought to have been fixed; 

(c) upheld the fourth ground of appeal concerning the second count - the sentence for that offence (when treated as the effective non-parole period) was manifestly excessive. 

218It is necessary for the Court to consider whether a lesser sentence or sentences should be imposed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . I am satisfied that the Applicant should be resentenced on the first, second and third counts. 

219If error was established and the Court determined to resentence the Applicant, the Court was asked to do so by reference to the material before the District Court. There was no affidavit sought to be read for the Applicant at the hearing in this Court, in the event that the Court moved to resentence. 

220Given the limited material placed before the District Court for the Applicant on sentence, members of the Court raised with counsel at the hearing the question whether, in the event error was established, application was to be made under s.12(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for the matter to be remitted to the District Court. Counsel sought an opportunity to take instructions on that question. On 24 May 2011, the Court was informed that, in the event the Court found error, the Applicant did not seek remittal to the District Court and asked that this Court proceed to resentence the Applicant. On 25 May 2011, the Crown concurred with this approach. 

221It is appropriate that the Court proceeds on this basis. 

222With respect to the first count, I have accepted the Applicant's submission, in support of the first ground of appeal, that his Honour erred in his characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence. It is necessary to keep in mind the maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 15 years to be taken into account as a guidepost, amongst other relevant factors, on sentence. This offence lay slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness of offences of this type. This conclusion has been reached having regard to the Applicant's role, the quantity of the drug and its purity. 

223In approaching the question of sentence, it is also necessary to keep in mind the findings made concerning the Applicant's motive in becoming involved, and remaining involved, in the offence, these matters bearing upon his moral culpability. 

224The Applicant was aged 33-34 years at the time of the offence. The immaturity of youth could not be claimed as a factor bearing upon his transgressions: R v Nguyen; R v Pham at 127 [72](k). The Applicant had a limited criminal history. There was no prior offence of drug supply. However, the Applicant had repeated offences of driving whilst disqualified which did not assist him in an assessment of his attitude towards compliance with the law. 

225In passing sentence on the first count, the Court is to take into account on a Form 1, an offence of supplying more than the commercial quantity of heroin, together with an offence of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime. Had the offence of supplying more than the commercial quantity of heroin been prosecuted separately on indictment, the maximum penalty would have been imprisonment for 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. Of course, the offence was not prosecuted separately, but (for reasons explained at [40] above) was included on a Form 1 to be taken into account on sentence for the first count. 

226It is necessary for this Court to take these offences into account in passing sentence on the first count, approaching the issue in the way referred to at [194] above. 

227Although the quality of heroin contained in the admixture of 468.3 grams of heroin and rice was not great, it remains the fact that the Applicant was actively marketing heroin, as part of the multi drug supply enterprise being conducted at the Balmain house. It is necessary for the sentence on the first count to give proper and appropriate account to this offence, as well as the proceeds of crime offence. 

228Having regard to all relevant factors, including the maximum penalty, the standard non-parole period, the objective seriousness of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the Applicant and the Form 1 offences, and after applying the 20% discount for the plea of guilty, a head sentence of 19 years' imprisonment should be passed. Because of the measure of accumulation to be applied, I find special circumstances so that a non-parole period of 13 years will be fixed. 

229The Applicant should be resentenced on the second count. That offence lay at the mid-range of objective seriousness. Having regard to all relevant factors, including the maximum penalty, the standard non-parole period, the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the Applicant, and after applying the 20% discount for the plea of guilty, a head sentence of eight years and eight months should be passed. I do not find special circumstances so that the non-parole period will be one of six years and six months. 

230The third count lay slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness. Having regard to all relevant factors, including the maximum penalty, the standard non-parole period, the objective seriousness of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the Applicant and the Form 1 offences, and after applying the 20% discount for a plea of guilty, a head sentence of 16 years' imprisonment should be passed. I do not find special circumstances so that the non-parole period will be a period of 12 years. 

231The fixed term of three years' imprisonment on the fourth count should be confirmed. 

232Having regard to the principles set out above (at [208]-[209], [212]-[216]) concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality, a measure of accumulation is necessary in this case. I am satisfied that the measures of accumulation adopted by the sentencing Judge concerning the fourth count (one year) and the third count (two years) remain appropriate. The sentence is to be reduced for the second count. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the measure of accumulation for that offence should be one year. I have kept in mind the totality principle (and the included concept of a ""crushing sentence"" ). It is appropriate that, of the effective non-parole period of 17 years, one year will relate solely to the fourth count, one year will relate solely to the second count and two years will relate solely to the third count. 

233The total effective sentence will comprise a non-parole period of 17 years with a balance of term of six years. 

234In my view, an effective non-parole period of 17 years reflects the minimum period which the Applicant should spend in prison for these serious crimes, having regard to all the elements of punishment including the objective gravity of the offences, the Applicant's subjective circumstances, rehabilitation and personal and general deterrence: R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92; 145 A Crim R 434 at 440 [33]. 

235For completeness, I note that it does not appear that the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154 bears directly upon the particular issues raised on this appeal. 

236I propose the following orders: 

(a) leave to appeal against sentence granted; 

(b) sentences imposed upon the first, second and third counts are quashed; 

(c) on the first count, the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of MDMA (ecstasy), taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the Applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 13 years commencing on 10 May 2012 and expiring on 9 May 2025, with a balance of term of six years commencing on 10 May 2025 and expiring on 9 May 2031; 

(d) on the second count, the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine, the Applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of six years and six months commencing on 10 May 2009 and expiring on 9 November 2015, with a balance of term of two years and two months commencing on 10 November 2015 and expiring on 9 January 2018; 

(e) on the third count, the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the Applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 10 May 2010 and expiring on 9 May 2022 with a balance of term of four years commencing on 10 May 2022 and expiring on 9 May 2026; 

(f) the sentence on the fourth count, receiving stolen goods, is confirmed, namely a fixed term of imprisonment for three years commencing on 10 May 2008 and expiring on 9 May 2011; 

(g) the earliest date upon which the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 10 May 2025. 

237HALL J : I agree with Johnson J.

2708925,Iskov v R [2011] NSWCCA 241,"Judgment 

1THE COURT : Clayton John Iskov applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the Supreme Court by Barr AJ for three offences, all of which had been committed on 6 August 2007 against his estranged wife Kylie Petrina Iskov. 

2The three offences were:- 

1.Maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. It will be convenient sometimes to refer to this offence in this judgment as ""the grievous bodily harm offence"". 

2.Aggravated taking and detaining for advantage, the circumstances of aggravation being that at the time of the taking actual bodily harm was occasioned to the victim. It will be convenient sometimes to refer to this offence in this judgment as ""the kidnapping offence"". 

3.Manslaughter. 

3The sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were:- 

1.For the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of six years commencing on 24 April 2008 and a balance of the term of two years. 24 April 2008 was the date on which the applicant had been arrested and from which he had remained in custody. 

2.For the offence of aggravated taking and detaining for advantage, a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of seven years six months commencing on 24 April 2011 and a balance of the term of two years six months. 

3.For the offence of manslaughter, a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of seven years six months commencing on 24 April 2014 and a balance of the term of four years six months. 

The total sentences imposed were head sentences of 18 years and non-parole periods of 13 years. 

4Maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was an offence under s 33 of the Crimes Act as it then stood, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 25 years. There was a standard non-parole period of seven years. Aggravated taking and detaining for advantage is an offence under s 86(2) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. There is no standard non-parole period for the offence. Manslaughter is an offence under ss 18 and 24 of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period for the offence. 

5The Crown case against the applicant, stated very broadly, was that the applicant and the victim were estranged; that they had a meeting on 6 August 2007; that after they met the applicant violently assaulted the victim inflicting serious injuries; that the applicant then drove a vehicle for a period of about 3 hours with the victim in the front passenger seat, unable because of her injuries to look after herself and unrestrained by a seatbelt, that the vehicle left the bitumen roadway and collided with a tree that as a result of the collision the victim's head struck the windscreen of the vehicle; and that the victim died soon afterwards. 

6The applicant was originally charged with murder and a trial on a charge of murder was fixed to commence before Barr AJ and a jury. The Crown case on the murder charge was that the victim had died as a result of the injuries inflicted on her during the assault. 

7Reports about the victim's injuries were furnished by a number of pathologists. Barr AJ directed that the various pathologists confer and prepare a joint report in which they would answer questions drafted by counsel and his Honour. The pathologists were able to agree on the answers which should be given to those questions, including what injuries had been suffered by the victim and which of those injuries had been suffered in the assault and which of them had been suffered in the collision. The pathologists also agreed that the most probable cause of the victim's death was a fracture of her skull caused at the time of the collision by the impact of her head with the windscreen of the vehicle. 

8In light of the pathologists' joint report the Crown indicated that it would not press the charge of murder and would accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter. Counsel for the parties then prepared a long statement of agreed facts. The applicant also made a number of formal admissions. 

The sentencing judge ' s remarks on sentence 

9The sentencing judge delivered lengthy remarks on sentence which were divided into sections, with headings for the sections. We will now summarise parts of the remarks on sentence, adopting his Honour's headings. 

The facts 

10In about 1997 the applicant and the victim entered into a relationship and soon afterwards they were married. Three children were born of the marriage. 

11In 2000 the applicant had an affair with another woman and this affair created continuing problems in the marriage. 

12In 2006 the applicant saw a naturopath and told her that he was depressed because he was having relationship problems. 

13In May 2007 the victim met again a man to whom she had been engaged to be married before she entered into her relationship with the applicant. The victim decided that her marriage to the applicant should be brought to an end and that she would re-commence a relationship with her former fiance. 

14The victim told the applicant that she wanted a divorce. The applicant took the news badly and on some subsequent occasions was observed to be emotional and crying. The victim and her children moved out of the family home. The applicant suspected that the victim was seeing her former fiance. 

15In June 2007 the applicant saw a psychologist Ms Saunders about the breakdown of his marriage. He also saw the naturopath a number of times. He told the naturopath he was depressed and griefstricken by the breakdown of the marriage and that he was taking sleeping tablets and anti-depressants. 

16The victim instructed a solicitor and told the solicitor that the applicant had agreed to move out of the former matrimonial home, so that she could move back in with the children of the marriage. 

17In paragraph 11 of this remarks on sentence the sentencing judge said:- 

""On 20 July the offender saw a general practitioner and obtained a letter referring him to the Mental Health Services of the North Coast Area Health Service. The referral said that he was moderately severely depressed with active suicidal ideation. On 25 July he was diagnosed with reactive depression. He had lost weight and was not sleeping well. He was concerned that the deceased might ""walk away with about 60 per cent of my portfolio and have custody of the children"". The offender saw Ms Saunders on 26 July. Her notes include this ""... foremost, losing Kylie, the kids, then money, himself somewhere in between. Feels he will never recover. Says he does not want to live. Has prescription re anti-depressants and sleeping tabs"". 

18Also on 20 July 2007 the victim's solicitor wrote a letter to the applicant informing him that she was acting for the victim in relation to financial and property issues arising from the breakdown of the marriage. 

19On 1 August 2007 the applicant made a thorough search of the car the victim had been using, looking for evidence that the victim had been seeing another man. 

20On 3 August 2007 the applicant told the naturopath that he felt like ending his life. 

21At about 8 o'clock on the morning of 6 August 2007 the deceased left the place where she was living in her car. Paragraph 17 of the remarks on sentence was as follows: 

""At 8.18 am the deceased spoke to the offender by telephone. Shortly afterwards the offender left his business, telling his secretary that he would be back soon. He walked away."" 

22Paragraph 19 of the remarks was as follows:- 

""There is no evidence of what the deceased and the offender said on the telephone before he left his place of work. It seems likely that they arranged to meet. They did meet, no later than about 9.10 am. The first of the formal admissions made by the offender states that about 9.10 am he entered the deceased's car. It was at about that time that the offender committed the first of the offences to which he has pleaded guilty and began to commit the second, the detention."" 

23In paragraphs 20 to 29 of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge dealt with the grievous bodily harm offence. In paragraph 20 of his remarks his Honour said:- 

""According to the second of the offender's formal admissions, he assaulted the deceased with a hard, blunt implement in the car soon after he had entered it. The offender states that as a result the deceased sustained multiple blunt force injuries to her head, left hand and left wrist, including bruising, swelling, lacerations and abrasions to the head and face. The assaults caused extensive bleeding from the head."" 

24An issue which arose in the sentence hearing was whether the assault by the applicant on the victim had begun outside the car. It was suggested that, if the assault had begun outside the car, that would have aggravated the offence, because then the assault would have extended over a longer period of time. The sentencing judge held that, even if such a finding could be made only if it could be made beyond reasonable doubt, he would nevertheless be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the assault had begun outside the car. However, his Honour also held that any resulting additional time for the assault would have been insignificant and noted the applicant's acceptance that he was responsible for all of the victim's injuries, whenever they were inflicted. 

25The watch the victim had been wearing on her wrist had stopped at about 9.10am. It could be inferred that the watch had stopped because the applicant had struck the victim on her wrist, damaging the watch. The soft tissue injury to the victim's wrist was treated at the sentence hearing as a circumstance aggravating the kidnapping offence and not as part of the injuries inflicted in the grievous bodily harm offence. 

26The sentencing judge discussed the extent to which the grievous bodily harm offence had been planned and found that the offence had not been planned, ""other than for a short period of time, something less than an hour immediately before its commencement"". 

27In paragraphs 30 to 32 of his remarks the sentencing judge dealt with the kidnapping offence. His Honour referred to a formal admission made by the applicant in the following terms:- 

""For approximately the next 3 hours the offender had control of the Holden Commodore. The offender drove the vehicle on various roads in the North Coast/Tweed Heads area. The offender did so in a state of confusion and in fear of the assaults being detected by others. The deceased was not at liberty to leave the offender's company during this period"". 

28At the sentence hearing counsel for the applicant informed the sentencing judge that the words ""in a state of confusion"" meant ""not knowing what to do"". Counsel for the applicant also said that the victim ""was not at liberty to leave the offender's company"", because the car was moving and the victim was incapacitated by her injuries. 

29In paragraphs 33 to 36 of his remarks the sentencing judge dealt with the manslaughter offence. 

30Shortly before 12.41 pm on the same day the car which was being driven by the applicant and in which the victim was a front seat passenger, collided with a tree which was a short distance from the edge of the bitumen roadway. The applicant was wearing a seat belt and was protected by an airbag which inflated. There was no airbag on the passenger's side of the vehicle. 

31At 12.41 a passing motorist who was a registered nurse saw the crashed car and stopped. She observed the victim lying on the floor on the front passenger's side of the car. The victim was not wearing a seat belt. The victim had serious injuries and was comatose. The victim died before ambulance officers arrived at the scene of the collision. 

32In paragraph 34 of his remarks the sentencing judge quoted a part of the agreed facts in which the basis of the applicant's offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence was stated. This basis was stated to be:- 

""The offender demonstrated a high degree of negligence and a disregard for the life and safety of the deceased through a combination of the following matters- 

1. Failing to exercise his duty of care over the deceased by taking her to a hospital following the assault to receive prompt medical attention; 

2. Driving the deceased around for a period of hours while she was in a vulnerable state and suffering from grievous bodily harm; and 

3. Driving in a negligent manner, which included driving a distressed and injured passenger, failing to ensure that the deceased was wearing a seat belt and paying inadequate attention to the road conditions so as to cause the collision with the tree."" 

33The sentencing judge recorded that the evidence showed, and the parties agreed, that the most probable cause of death was a fracture of the base of the skull caused by the impact of the victim's head with the windscreen. 

34The sentencing judge noted that there had been no suggestion that any feature of the car had played a part in causing the collision with the tree. The speed limit at the location of the collision was 90 kilometres per hour. Police officers had given varying estimates of the speed of the car at the time of the collision, ranging from 45 to 70 kilometres per hour. 

35In paragraphs 37 to 39 of his remarks the sentencing judge dealt with the victim's injuries. His Honour listed the injuries which were present immediately after the collision. The sixth and seventh injuries listed were lacerations and abrasions to the victim's forehead. 

36In paragraph 38 of his remarks his Honour said:- 

""The parties are agreed that the sixth and seventh injuries must have resulted from the contact of the deceased's head with the windscreen at the time of the collision. Otherwise, it is agreed that the injuries must have existed before the collision. They resulted from the assault carried out by the offender shortly after he met the deceased and at around the time when she came to be in the front passenger seat of the vehicle. They comprised a number of individual impacts to the left side of the head, to the right temple, to the forehead at various angles as far down as the eyebrows and as far up at least as the hairline. There was an impact to the nose, causing distortion, and damage to the chin. There was bruising to the eyes with marked swelling on the left and blackening on the right. The lips were swollen. The left cheek was bruised and swollen. The upper two thirds of the left ear were heavily bruised and swollen. The injuries were characteristic of impacts with a narrow, blunt-edged object. They had been applied from the left side, the right side, the front and the upper front of the head."" 

37There were also injuries to the victim's hands which the sentencing judge found had been inflicted as the victim attempted to ward off repeated blows from the applicant. 

The offender's motive 

38The sentencing judge found that the applicant had attacked the victim because he was possessive of her, he was jealous of the other man she was seeing, he was apprehensive that the victim would be awarded custody of their children and he feared financial loss as a result of a dividing-up of their assets. 

39The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had been diagnosed as having, and was being treated for, a reactive depression. However, his Honour found that there was no disorder in the applicant's thought processes and that he had insight into his condition. His Honour found that there was ""no evidence to explain how or why his illness bore upon his intention to attack the deceased as he did"". His Honour added:- 

""Nevertheless, I am prepared to allow that his illness might in some unexplained way have affected his attitude and motivation. I shall accordingly bear this in mind when imposing sentence, but the effect it can have is modest."" 

Matters personal to the offender 

40Under this heading the sentencing judge traced the history of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, which we referred to briefly earlier in this judgment. 

41The sentencing judge noted, inter alia, the early willingness of the applicant to plead guilty to manslaughter, the obtaining by the defence of an important pathologist's report, the suggestion of the defence lawyers that a joint pathologists' report be obtained, the change of attitude on the part of the Crown after the joint report had been obtained and the part the defence had played in formulating the ways in which the criminality of the offender before the collision and in the collision itself could be comprehended. His Honour concluded that ""the matter was dealt with in a timely fashion on the part of the defence and all three pleas of guilty should be treated as having been offered at the earliest opportunity"". His Honour said he would allow a maximum discount for all three pleas of guilty. 

42His Honour noted that the applicant had no previous criminal history, that his actions in attacking the victim had been out of character, that he was unlikely to re-offend and that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour also noted that the applicant had not expressed any remorse and that his counsel had not submitted that the applicant was remorseful. 

Assessment of the seriousness of the offences 

43In this part of his remarks the sentencing judge made an assessment of the seriousness of each of the offences. 

The grievous bodily harm offence 

44All the injuries suffered by the victim would have to be taken into account, apart from the injury to the wrist and the two injuries caused when the victim's head had hit the windscreen of the car. 

45The sentencing judge found that the injuries to be taken into account in sentencing for this offence were very serious. They had been inflicted when a male had taken up a hard, blunt instrument and beaten a woman many times about the head, from a number of different angles. 

46His Honour considered that no finding could be made about what might have been the consequences of these injuries, if the collision had not occurred. The expert pathologists have not been asked to express any opinion on this question. The only finding the sentencing judge considered he could make was that the injuries deliberately inflicted by the applicant had not substantially contributed to the victim's death. 

47The sentencing judge was, of course, sentencing the applicant before the recent decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) HCA 39. As there was a standard non-parole period for the offence, his Honour considered that he was obliged to make a finding about the level of objective seriousness of the offence in relation to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. His Honour found that the offence was a little above the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. However, after taking into account the discount for the plea of guilty, his Honour said he would impose a sentence with a non-parole period a little below the standard non-parole period of seven years. 

The kidnapping offence 

48The only injury to be taken into account in sentencing for this offence was the soft tissue injury to the victim's wrist. 

49The victim had been detained in a moving car from which she was unable to escape, because of the motion of the car and the disabilities resulting from her injuries. The advantage the applicant intended to obtain was to delay the detection by others of his assault on the victim and during the period of the detention he obtained that advantage. The period of the detention was about 3 hours. 

The manslaughter offence 

50Having regard to some of the applicant's grounds of appeal against sentence, paragraphs 59 and 60 of the remarks on sentence, in which the sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter, should be set out in full. 

""59. The collision of the car with the tree was caused by the gross criminal negligence of the offender. The deceased died of injuries she received in the collision, by far the most serious of which was the fracture of the base of the skull. Her injuries were received when the deceased, unrestrained by any seat belt, was thrown forward when the car suddenly stopped. The offender demonstrated a high degree of negligence and a disregard for the safety of the deceased in that he failed to exercise his duty of care over the deceased by taking her to a hospital following the assault so that she could receive prompt medical attention, kept her in the car for a period of hours while she was in a vulnerable state and suffering from grievous bodily harm and drove in a negligent manner, which included driving a distressed and injured passenger, failing to ensure that the deceased was wearing a seat belt and paying inadequate attention to the road conditions so as to cause the collision with the tree. 

60. The negligent driving of the car immediately before the collision was not of a particularly high order. There was no excessive speed and no evidence of other misbehaviour. It is not to be assumed that the collision with the tree was deliberate. However, the negligent manner of driving at the time was aggravated by the offender's failure to ensure that his passenger was wearing a seat belt. And when one adds the other failures by the offender to exercise his duty of care towards the deceased that I have described above his offence must be seen as a serious one of its kind."" 

Concurrency 

51The sentencing judge considered that there were a number of factors which would require a substantial degree of concurrency in the sentences to be imposed for the three offences. These factors included that all of the offences had been committed against the same victim within a period of a few hours and that there was a high degree of interrelationship between the offences, which his Honour illustrated by examples. 

Special circumstances 

52The sentencing judge declined to find any special circumstances, apart from the partial accumulation of the sentences he would be imposing. His Honour said that he had taken into account such factors as the applicant's lack of a prior criminal history and his emotional state at the time of the offences, in determining the head sentences. 

The Appeal 

53The applicant relied on the following grounds of appeal against sentence: 

1. The sentencing judge erred in his assessment and characterisation of the gravity of the offending in relation to the manslaughter offence. 

2. The manslaughter sentence is manifestly excessive. 

3. The kidnapping sentence is manifestly excessive. 

4. The sentencing judge erred by fully accumulating the manslaughter sentence upon the non-parole period of the grievous bodily harm offence. 

5. In the alternative to ground four, the sentencing judge erred by refusing to find special circumstances and adjust the ratio between the non-parole period and total term of the sentence. 

54We shall now proceed to consider these grounds of appeal. 

1. The sentencing judge erred in his assessment and characterisation of the gravity of the offending in relation to the manslaughter offence. 

2. The manslaughter sentence is manifestly excessive. 

It is convenient to deal with these grounds of appeal together. 

55Earlier in this judgment we summarised or quoted from paragraphs 33 to 36 of the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence in which his Honour stated the facts of the manslaughter offence and we quoted paragraphs 59 and 60 of the remarks in which his Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter. 

56It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the sentencing judge had made specific errors, in the first sentence of paragraph 59 of his remarks; in the way in which his Honour had in paragraphs 59 and 60 of his remarks treated the agreed basis on which the plea of guilty to manslaughter by gross criminal negligence had been offered and accepted; in the second last sentence of paragraph 60 of the remarks; and in the last sentence of paragraph 60 of the remarks. 

57In support of the second ground of appeal it was submitted that, in sentencing the applicant for the offence of manslaughter, the sentencing judge was required to take into account, inter alia, the low level of negligence by the applicant in the driving of the car, the confused mental state of the applicant when driving the car and the favourable subjective features which the sentencing judge had found the applicant to have and was also required to avoid double punishment, that is in sentencing the applicant for the manslaughter offence to avoid punishing him for conduct which had already been punished in the sentences for the grievous bodily harm offence or the kidnapping offence. It was submitted that, when these matters were taken into account, the starting point for the sentence which the sentencing judge had adopted, that is a sentence of 16 years before allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty, could be seen to be manifestly excessive. 

Decision 

58There is utility in stating the general principles of manslaughter by criminal negligence. 

59In Nydam v R (1977) VR 430 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria said at [445]:- 

""In order to establish manslaughter by criminal negligence, it is sufficient if the prosecution shows that the act which caused the death was done by the accused consciously and voluntarily, without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment"". 

60The judgment of the Victorian Full Court in Nydam has been approved by the High Court in Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313 at 333 per Mason CJ, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. R v Lavender (2005) 222 CLR 67 at 75 [17] and 87 [60] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ and at 90 [72] and 110 [136] per Kirby J. 

61Manslaughter by criminal negligence depends upon the offender owing the deceased a duty of care; Burns v R [2011] NSWCCA 56 at [96] per McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J. To constitute manslaughter by criminal negligence the breach of duty must be ""gross""; Burns at [103]. ""A very high degree of negligence"" is required ( Burns at [103]). The breach of duty must have caused the death of the deceased ( Nydam at [333]), that is it must have been a substantial or significant cause of the death of the deceased. 

62In the present case there is no doubt that the applicant owed a duty of care to his wife, who was a passenger in the car he was driving and who was incapacitated by her injuries from attending to her own safety. However, it will be necessary to determine what were the acts or omissions on the part of the applicant which exhibited a very high degree of negligence and which had a causal connection with the death of the victim. 

63We will now proceed to consider the specific errors contended for by counsel for the applicant. 

64In the first sentence of paragraph 59 of his remarks the sentencing judge said ""The collision of the car with the tree was caused by the gross criminal negligence of the offender"". It seems to us unlikely that his Honour intended to convey what would be the literal meaning of this sentence. The literal meaning would be inconsistent with the balance of paragraph 59 and his Honour's finding in paragraph 60 that the negligent driving of the car immediately before the collision was not of a particularly high order. In our opinion, it is likely that by the first sentence of paragraph 59 his Honour intended to say no more than that the death of the victim, the immediate cause of which was the collision of the car with the tree, was caused by the criminal negligence of the applicant. If the sentence is read in this way, it is not in itself erroneous. 

65In the second half of paragraph 59 of his remarks the sentencing judge repeated the three matters, the combination of which he had said in paragraph 34 ""demonstrated a high degree of negligence and a disregard for the life and safety of the deceased"". 

66It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that it was the combination of the three matters that amounted to criminal negligence and that the first and second matters were not free-standing, independent particulars of negligence but merely ""fed into"", or were introductory to, the third matter. However, it was submitted, the sentencing judge had treated the first and second matters as serious particulars of negligence in their own right and as having the effect of making the applicant's offence of manslaughter much worse than it otherwise would have been. For reasons which we will endeavour to develop in this part of our judgment, we consider that these submissions by counsel for the applicant should be upheld. 

67In paragraph 60 of his remarks the sentencing judge, after finding that the negligent driving of the car immediately before the collision had not been of a particularly high order, including that there had not been any excessive speed or any evidence of other misbehaviour as a driver (apart from deviating from the roadway), said that ""the negligent manner of driving was aggravated by the offender's failure to ensure that the victim as his passenger was wearing a seat belt"". It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that it was an error to find that the failure to ensure that the victim was restrained by a seat belt was an ""aggravating"" factor, that is a factor making worse what was already, independently, a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence. On the contrary, the failure to ensure that the victim was restrained by a seat belt was integral or central to the applicant's criminal negligence. We would accept these submissions by counsel for the applicant. 

68In the last sentence of paragraph 60 of his remarks the sentencing judge said:- 

""And when one adds the other failures by the offender to exercise his duty of care towards the deceased that I have described above his offence must be seen as a serious one of its kind."" 

69""The other failures"", that is the failures apart from the negligent manner of driving at the time of the collision and the failure to ensure that the victim was wearing a seatbelt, are clearly the first two matters in the combination of three matters stated in paragraphs 34 and 59 of the remarks. 

70The first of these matters was that the applicant failed to exercise his duty of care to the deceased by taking her to a hospital following the assault, so that she could receive prompt medical attention. There is no doubt that the applicant owed a duty of care to the victim and that he breached that duty of care by not taking her to a hospital so that she could receive medical attention. 

71However, there would not appear to me to be any causal connection, or at least any substantial or significant causal connection, between this breach of the applicant's duty of care and the victim's death. As we stated earlier in this judgment, the sentencing judge considered that no finding could be made about what might have been the consequences of the injuries inflicted by the applicant on the victim, if the collision had not occurred. The only causal connection suggested at the hearing of the application was that the failure by the applicant to take the victim to a hospital for treatment ensured that the victim's state of vulnerability continued and, in that way, it might be that there was some indirect causal relationship between the failure of the applicant to take the victim to a hospital and the victim's death. It is true that there was a causal connection of a trivial kind between the failure to take the victim to a hospital and the death of the victim, in the sense that, if the victim had been taken to a hospital (or any other place), she would not have been a passenger in a car driven by the applicant when the car collided with a tree. However, such a causal connection would be insufficient to establish an offence of manslaughter. 

72The position would, of course, have been different, if the victim had died of the injuries for which she might have been treated at a hospital, although, if that had happened, the Crown would probably have continued to press the charge of murder, rather than bring a charge of manslaughter by criminal negligence. 

73In our opinion, having regard to the absence of any causal connection, or at least any substantial or significant causal connection with the victim's death, it was not open to the sentencing judge to give the applicant's failure to take the victim to a hospital the degree of significance which it would appear his Honour gave it, in sentencing the applicant for manslaughter by criminal negligence. We consider that the applicant's failure to take the victim to a hospital so that she could receive prompt medical attention for the injuries she had suffered from the assault, would have been more appropriately dealt with as a matter aggravating either the grievous bodily harm offence or the kidnapping offence. As to the latter, it would be a matter aggravating the kidnapping offence that the applicant continued to detain the victim while the victim was needing medical attention. 

74The second matter in the combination of three matters stated in paragraphs 34 and 59 of the sentencing judge's remarks was that the applicant drove the victim around for a period of hours, while she was in a vulnerable state and suffering from grievous bodily harm. 

75In our opinion, the sentencing judge was not entitled to give this ""failure"" any more than very limited weight. That the victim was in a vulnerable state does not differ in substance from the parts of the third matter asserting that the victim was ""distressed and injured"". The sentencing judge, having sentenced the applicant for the grievous bodily harm offence, could not punish him again because the victim was suffering from grievous bodily harm. We would accept that the second matter does make explicit that the applicant's conduct in driving the victim continued for a period of hours. 

76In the last sentence of paragraph 60 of his remarks the sentencing judge said that the applicant's offence ""must be seen as a serious one of its kind"". Although it might not be entirely clear, we consider that his Honour should be taken as saying, not merely that the applicant's negligence had reached the very high degree of negligence required before there can be any liability at all for manslaughter by criminal negligence, but that, as a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence, the applicant's case was, when compared with other cases of manslaughter by criminal negligence, a serious example of that form of manslaughter. 

77We are conscious of the latitude which this Court extends to assessments by sentencing judges of the level of objective seriousness of offences. We have, nevertheless, concluded that it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that the applicant's offence was a comparatively serious example of manslaughter by criminal negligence. 

78The sentencing judge himself made a finding that the negligence in the driving of the car immediately before the collision was not of a particularly high order. Indeed, it was quite minor. Photographs of the car in situ against the tree with which it had collided show that the tree was no more than a couple of metres to the side of the bitumen. Half of the rear of the car is shown as still being on the bitumen. Accordingly, the applicant's failure to control the car was only slight. 

79Apart from the negligence in the failure to control the car immediately before the collision, the other acts or omissions of the applicant which were negligent and which had a causal connection with the death of the victim were, driving for an extended period of time with a front seat passenger who the applicant knew was incapacitated by her injuries from attending to her own safety, without ensuring that the passenger was restrained by a seatbelt. For reasons we have already given, the other ""failures"" of the applicant could not be used to significantly increase the seriousness of the applicant's offence. 

80We conclude that the sentencing judge made some specific errors in sentencing the applicant for the manslaughter offence and the first ground of appeal should be upheld. We also consider that, given our conclusions about the degree of objective seriousness of the offence, the need to avoid double punishment, the presence of some favourable subjective features and the discount of 25 per cent for the early plea of guilty (and the co-operation of the defence in the sentencing process), the sentence of 12 years for the manslaughter offence was manifestly excessive and the second ground of appeal should also be upheld. 

3. The kidnapping sentence is manifestly excessive 

81Counsel for the applicant submitted that in the part of his Honour's remarks in which he assessed the seriousness of the offence his Honour had not referred to the applicant's being in a ""state of confusion"" while committing the offence. It was submitted that the offence would have been more serious, if the applicant had been clear-headed when committing the offence. However, his Honour did refer to the applicant's state of confusion in stating the facts of the offence earlier in his remarks and we would not find that his Honour overlooked the applicant's contemporaneous mental state in assessing the seriousness of the offence. 

82It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the circumstance of aggravation, that is the actual bodily harm to the victim's wrist, was minor and that some offences of taking and detaining involve a detaining of the victim for longer, and sometimes much longer, than 3 hours. 

83In our opinion, this ground of appeal should be rejected. The maximum sentence for the offence is 20 years. No specific error by the sentencing Judge has been established. The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge could not, in our opinion, be regarded as manifestly excessive. 

84Even if this Court were to allow this ground of appeal and to re-sentence the applicant, this Court in re-sentencing would have to take into account, as aggravating the applicant's criminality, the serious medical condition of the victim during the detention and her need for prompt medical attention. 

4. The learned sentencing judge erred by fully accumulating the manslaughter sentence upon the non-parole period of the grievous bodily harm offence 

85It is the case that the sentencing judge fully accumulated the sentence for the manslaughter offence on the non-parole period of the sentence for the grievous bodily harm offence, by ordering that the manslaughter sentence commence on 24 April 2014, the day after the non-parole period of the grievous bodily harm sentence would expire. 

86As his Honour was sentencing for a number of offences, he was obliged to have regard to the principles governing concurrency and accumulation of sentences. These principles were discussed in Cahyadi v The Queen (2006) 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27] [28] per Howie J and in R v XX (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at 48-50 [52] per Hall J. 

87In Cahyadi Howie J said in part at 47 [27]:- 

""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences........."" 

88Subject to the application of established principle, questions of concurrency and accumulation of sentences are discretionary (Hall J in XX at 48 [52]) 

89In the present case the sentencing judge considered questions of accumulation and concurrency of the sentences he was about to impose in the section of his remarks on sentence heading ""Concurrency"". His Honour concluded that there had to be a substantial degree of concurrency in the sentences and there is, in fact, a substantial degree of concurrency in the sentences his Honour imposed. 

90However, there was some criminality in each offence which was not comprehended within the other offences. For example, the inflicting of the injuries other than the injury to the wrist and the sixth and seventh injuries in the list set out in his Honour's remarks were part of the grievous bodily harm offence and not comprehended in either of the other offences. The detaining of the victim in the car was part of the kidnapping offence and was not comprehended within either of the other offences. The failure to cause the victim to be restrained by a seat belt, the driving of the car off the roadway and the causing of the death of the victim were part of the manslaughter offence and not comprehended within either of the other offences. 

91Accordingly, the sentencing judge was required to make each sentence partly cumulative on the preceding sentence or sentences. In our opinion it cannot be said that the degree of accumulation provided for by the sentences imposed by his Honour was outside a permissible exercise of his Honour's discretion. 

92We would reject the fourth ground of appeal. 

5. In the alternative to ground four, the learned sentencing judge erred by refusing to find special circumstances and adjust the ratio between the non-parole period and total term of the sentence 

93The sentencing judge did find special circumstances in the accumulation of sentences and reduced the non-parole period of the final sentence below the statutory ratio, so that the aggregate non-parole periods were not more than three-quarters of the aggregate head sentences. 

94It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the sentencing judge should have made a further finding of special circumstances, so that the aggregate non-parole periods would be less than three-quarters of the aggregate head sentences. 

95In his remarks the sentencing judge gave careful consideration to whether he should make any further finding of special circumstances and concluded that he should not. His Honour reasoned that the matters which were relied on as constituting special circumstances had already been taken into account by him in determining the head sentences and should not be counted twice in favour of the applicant. This reasoning was in accordance with authority R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18]. 

96In any event, a finding by a sentencing judge that there are, or are not, special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact and the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to intervene with such a finding is very limited; R v el-Hayek (2004) 144 A Crim R 90 at 109 [103]. If there has been a finding of special circumstances, the size of any adjustment to the statutory ratio so as to reflect the finding of special circumstances raises so many matters of a discretionary character that the Court of Criminal Appeal will be very slow to intervene; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; Stoeski v R [2008] NSWCCA 230 at [25]. 

97We would reject this ground of appeal. 

Conclusion 

98We have upheld the first and second grounds of appeal relating to the sentence for the manslaughter offence, including the second ground of appeal that the sentence was manifestly excessive, and we have rejected the other grounds of appeal. It is accordingly necessary for this Court to re-sentence for the manslaughter offence. 

99We have already referred to the facts of the manslaughter offence, the conclusions we have reached about the nature and degree of the objective seriousness of the offence and to the subjective features of the applicant, including his early plea of guilty. In our opinion, the applicant should be sentenced to a head sentence of nine years for the manslaughter offence. We would not otherwise intervene in the sentences set by the sentencing judge or in the degree of accumulation of sentences set by the sentencing judge. Like the sentencing judge, we would not find special circumstances otherwise than in the accumulation of sentences. To preserve the usual proportion between the aggregate head sentences and the aggregate non-parol periods we would reduce the non-parole period for the manslaughter offence to five years three months. 

100Accordingly, the sentence for the manslaughter offence would be a non-parole period of five years three months commencing on 24 April 2014 and expiring on 23 July 2019 and a balance of the term of three years nine months commencing on 24 July 2019 and expiring on 23 April 2023. The total head sentence would be 15 years and the total non-parole periods would be 11 years three months. 

101We consider the following orders should be made:- 

Leave to appeal against sentences imposed on the applicant by Barr AJ on 20 September 2010 granted. 

Appeal against the sentence for the offence of manslaughter allowed. 

Sentence for the offence of manslaughter quashed. 

In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter to a non-parole period of five years three months commencing on 24 April 2014 and expiring on 23 July 2019 and a balance of term of three years nine months commencing on 24 July 2019 and expiring on 23 April 2023. 

Otherwise confirm the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge. 

The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 23 July 2019.

Grounds of Appeal 

8By Notice of Application For Leave to Appeal filed on 6 May 2011, the Applicant identified the following grounds of appeal: 

(a) Ground 1 - the sentencing Judge erred when he characterised Count 1 on the indictment as falling ""around"" the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences under that provision. 

(b) Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred when he characterised Count 3 on the indictment as an offence ""well within the upper range of objective seriousness for offences under this particular provision"" and in the result the sentence was excessive. 

(c) Ground 3 - the degree of accumulation as between Count 1 and Count 2 is excessive. 

(d) Ground 4 - the degree of accumulation as between Count 2 and Count 3 on the indictment was excessive. 

(e) Ground 5 - the overall sentence was manifestly excessive and did not reflect the mitigating factors found by the sentencing Judge and a lesser sentence is warranted in law. 

9Mr Smith, counsel for the Applicant, abandoned the second ground at the hearing before this Court on 8 September 2011. 

Facts of Offences 

10The Applicant was arrested and charged with respect to these offences on 21 July 2008. He was committed for trial from the Liverpool Local Court on 24 June 2009. 

11The Applicant's trial was listed to commence at the Parramatta District Court on 15 March 2010. The Applicant entered pleas of guilty on 17 March 2010 (before the trial commenced) and the sentencing hearing was adjourned and proceeded ultimately before his Honour Judge Sides QC on 9 August 2010. After evidence and submissions, his Honour passed sentence later that day. 

12A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The Applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. 


13His Honour made the following findings of fact (ROS2-6): 

""In March 2008 police attached to the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad commenced strike force 'Cartella'. From those enquiries the Offender was identified as having involvement in drug supply activities. During the course of these enquiries police applied a number of covert strategies to monitor movements of the Offender. 

On 15 July 2008 pursuant to a lawful warrant, police commenced monitoring a mobile telephone service which the Offender was then using. 

During the course of the evening of 21 July 2008 police became aware through monitoring of intercepted telephone conversations that the Offender was going to meet a person identified as Tracy Gresham. It was suspected by police that this meeting was for the purpose of supplying a prohibited drug. During one of the intercepted telephone conversations the Offender told Tracy Gresham that he was delayed in meeting her because he was waiting for something. 

At about 7.30pm on that day police attached to the Middle Eastern 
Organised Crime Squad commenced surveillance of the Offender's residence in Mount Pritchard. At about 8pm an unknown male attended the premises and dropped off a package and a plastic bag. Shortly thereafter a telephone call between the Offender and Tracy Gresham was intercepted. During this call the Offender told Miss Gresham that he was now ready to leave. 

The Offender left the front door of the premises carrying a black backpack. He opened the boot of his mother's Falcon. A police officer observed him place the backpack in the boot of the vehicle and lean into the boot and appeared to shuffle something from the middle of the boot to the rear right side quarter panel area. The Offender then closed the boot, returned to the house for a short time and then came out to the motor vehicle. No one else entered the motor vehicle during his brief absence. The Offender then drove the car and travelled in a northerly direction followed by police. 

Sometime after entering Robert Street in Smithfield the vehicle was stopped. At this time the Offender was the only occupant of the vehicle. He was asked to get out of the vehicle and a search of it was conducted. Police found a white sock located wedged between the carpet and centre console near the driver's side foot well. Amongst other things it contained a silver weight that had a screwed top, some tablets were found inside the weight. Also in the sock was what appeared to be prohibited drugs. These were seized by the police and later analysis revealed the following: 

Â· there were seven tablets weighing in net 1.65 grams that contained ecstasy and gives rise to one offence on the Form 1 Schedule; 

Â· there was crystalline substance weighing 1.3 grams and hard crystal substance weighing 3.7 grams, both of which were found to contain methylamphetamine and give rise to another offence on the Form 1 Schedule; 

Â· in a small cellophane packet there was powder that was 1.5 grams in weight and contained cocaine giving rise to another offence on the Form 1 Schedule; 

The Offender was arrested and cautioned. 

When the police searched the boot area of the car, they looked behind the lining on the rear quarter panel on the right hand side and located the following items: 

Â· one 9 millimetre pistol that was in a loaded state and contained seven 9 millimetre hollow point rounds of ammunition, this gives rise to count 3 on the indictment and the possession of the unauthorised possession of ammunition on the Form 1 Schedule; 

Â· a large quantity of crystalline substance in two separate resealable bags, one containing a pale yellow crystalline substance and the other containing a pinkish crystalline substance. Both of these items were analysed and found to be methylamphetamine with a total weight of 94.6 grams giving rise to count 2; 

Â· a further three plastic bags were located that contained a large quantity of pink tablets identical in appearance to the ones found in the sock, found in the body of the car. When analysed and weighed the tablets came to 194 grams and contained ecstasy giving rise to count 1; and 

Â· in the same area they also found a large quantity of currency coming to $50,060.85 giving rise to one offence on the Form 1 Schedule. 

As was his right the Offender declined to participate in an interview. 

After the initial items were found a search of the Offender's car was recorded by video camera. During the search police located instructions in the vehicle that contained a list of chemicals used to manufacture ecstasy. This gives rise to another offence on a Form 1 Schedule. There is no evidence that the Offender was involved in the manufacture of ecstasy. However, the piece of paper was tested for fingerprints and prints identical to the Offender's index left thumb, right index and middle finger and the right little finger were found on the piece of paper. The finding for the document was relevant to the state of the Offender's knowledge in relation to the ecstasy found in the boot. 

On the driver's seat the police found a Nokia phone and when they used a mobile phone to call the number that the Offender had been using this phone rang. 

When the police searched the boot they found the backpack that the accused had been seen to put in it. Inside this backpack they found a Taser-like stun device that gives rise to yet another offence on the Form 1 Schedule. The Taser was fitted with two static electrodes which required it to come on contact with the subject in order to be effective. However, it had sustained damage and was not able to be used. 

Police estimate that the ecstasy tablets found in the car, which approximated 700 in number, had a street value of about $28,000 and a wholesale price of about $12,600. The purity of the ecstasy found in the car ranged from 44% to 61%. The value of the 94.6 grams of methylamphetamine is estimated to have a street value of $47,000 and a wholesale value of about $11,000. There is no evidence that the Offender was selling prohibited drugs at a street level. 

The pistol that police found in the boot of the car was in working order and it was a self-loading pistol. It had a detachable magazine. The Offender was not licensed to be in possession of the pistol or the Taser-like device. Enquiries failed to locate any owner of the pistol or any record of the pistol ever having been registered."" 

14The sentencing Judge observed that the quantity of ecstasy involved in the first count exceeded the commercial quantity by a little over 55%, and was about 39% of the large commercial quantity for that drug. 

15With respect to the second count, the quantity of methylamphetamine was about 38% of the commercial quantity, and was 31.5 times the traffickable quantity for that drug, and was well over 18 times the indictable quantity. 

The Applicant ' s Subjective Circumstances 

16Before the sentencing Judge were a presentence report dated 14 May 2010, a report of Dr John Jacmon, psychologist, dated 24 May 2010, a reference and a number of certificates. A handwritten letter from the Applicant was admitted, although he did not give evidence. In addition, oral evidence was given by two persons, Susan Zaiter and Jason Michael, who knew the Applicant and his family. 

17The Applicant has a prior criminal history. In December 1998, he was fined in the Penrith Local Court for possession of a prohibited drug and possession of an unauthorised firearm (not being a prohibited firearm or pistol). 

18In August 2005, he was sentenced in the Parramatta District Court for robbery in company and detaining a person in company with intent to obtain advantage. The Applicant was sentenced to a total effective term of imprisonment of five years and three months commencing on 8 January 2004 and expiring on 7 April 2009, with a non-parole period of three years and three months expiring on 7 April 2007. 

19Accordingly, the present offences were committed whilst the Applicant was on parole. On 7 August 2008, the State Parole Authority revoked his parole, resulting in a term of imprisonment of eight months and 18 days from 22 July 2008 to 8 April 2009. 

20The sentencing Judge summarised the Applicant's subjective circumstances in the following way (ROS6-8): 

""Born in Iraq in 1975, the Offender came to Australia with his mother and brother when he was about seven years old. His father had apparently been killed in the Iraq/Iran war. Sometime after their arrival in this country his mother remarried, producing a blended family. That marriage lasted about five years. According to the Pre-Sentence Report he had the disadvantage of suffering physical abuse at his stepfather's hands. As a result of the separation the Offender was left with the responsibility of caring for his mother and siblings. At the time of his arrest he was single and living with his mother and nephew. 

The Court notes that he had been in a relationship for some years prior to his arrest that had ended well before his arrest. 

It seems that, after obtaining his Higher School Certificate, the Offender worked in a wide variety of jobs, mostly in the hospitality industry. Whilst in custody between 2004 and 2007 he undertook a large number of courses and, following his release to parole in April 2007, he set up his own excavation and concreting business. However, this business began to fail in the months preceding his arrest because he had neglected it due to his increasing drug abuse. 

The Offender developed a poly-substance abuse problem commencing when he was 19 years old and frequently avoided home to hide his drug usage from his family. 

The Offender cannot claim the benefit of prior good character. During 1988 [sic - 1998] he was fined for possession of an unauthorised firearm, not a pistol, and possession of drugs. On 26 August 2005 he was sentenced to five years and three months, with three years and three months non-parole for kidnapping, with a concurrent sentence for robbery in company. The sentences commenced on 8 January 2004. He was released to parole on 7 April 2007. During the first 12 months on parole he participated in relapse programs, was subjected to urinalysis and was otherwise compliant with supervision which was suspended after about 12 months. However, parole was revoked because of the current offences. He had eight months and 18 days to serve as a result of the revocation and that sentence expired on 8 April last year. 

About six months before his arrest the Offender started using amphetamines and benzodiazepines to assist with 'overwhelming pressures' he was facing. His drug usage quickly got out of hand affecting his daily functioning and family relationships. It seems that part of the pressures he faced were financial in nature. He is eager to participate in intensive drug and alcohol programs in gaol such as the Compulsory Drug Treatment Program in Parklea. However, in the Court's view, he is not eligible for that program. He has already completed the 12 sessions of the 'Getting Smart' program and participates in Narcotics Anonymous. He has actively participated in some educational and vocational programs and apparently now works in the fitness area. He is the Middle Eastern Delegate in Parklea Gaol, a position he discharges effectively. He has not incurred any disciplinary charges. The Court notes that he regularly attends Bible studies. 

The Court notes that he suffers from a borderline personality disorder that could reflect itself in poor impulse control, instability in mood, relationships, self confidence and behaviour amongst other things. At times he could suffer bouts of severe depression and/or anxiety. There is no evidence that this disorder has made his time in gaol anymore burdensome than somebody not have such infliction."" 
 
Some Further Findings of the Sentencing Judge 

21As a result of the Applicant pleading guilty when his trial was due to begin, his Honour reduced his sentence by about 10% to reflect the utility of his guilty pleas (ROS2). 

22The sentencing Judge accepted that the Applicant was ""remorseful and has insight into the role his drug usage played in the offending"" and that he accepted responsibility for his offences and acknowledged the harm that they caused, so that the Court extended leniency because of remorse (ROS2). 

23Having regard to submissions made in this Court, it is appropriate to set out his Honour's findings concerning the Applicant's role in the drug supply offences (ROS8-10): 

""Counsel for the Offender argued that the Offender's role was limited to being a courier of wholesale quantities of both drugs. He relied on the Offender's departure from his home shortly after he received a delivery and the terms of the phone conversations between him and Tracy Gresham before and after the delivery to the Offender's house and the absence of a police search of the Offender's home. According to exhibit A police suspected that the Offender was going to meet Tracy Gresham for the purposes of supplying her drugs. However, that was no more than suspicion on their part. There is no evidence that what was delivered to the Offender in a plastic [sic] formed any part of what the police found when they stopped his mother's car or what was in the boot at that time. One could not exclude the possibility that some of the things that the police found in his mother's car when they stopped it had been the subject of that delivery. In the Court's view, a combination of circumstances justifies excluding that the Offender's role is limited to delivering the drugs the subject to counts 1 and 2. Those circumstances are as follows: 

1. The drugs were divided between five bags, three of which contained ecstasy tablets, the other two bags contained methylamphetamine of different colours with a purity ranging between 44% and 61%. 

2. The evidence indicates that the drugs were of significant value. 

3. The five bags of drugs were found in the same part of the boot as the money and the loaded firearm. It is unlikely that a mere courier of even that quantity of drugs would also have a large quantity of money on him. If he were a mere courier who wanted to protect the money and/or the drugs he would not have had the gun in the same area of the car as the money and drugs. He told the probation officer that the person who gave him the pistol told him not to lose his money. As the Offender did not give evidence it is not clear if this assertion related to the money that the police found in the car or money he might get from the sale of the drugs. Further, that the Taser was found in that position where the Offender would not have had ready access to it without getting out of the car. 

The Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender was involved in supplying these two drugs at a wholesale level. His exact role is not entirely clear from the evidence presented to the Court, but it was more than merely being a courier or somebody transporting the drug from point A to point B. Whilst he may not have been in the upper echelons of the drug trafficking hierarchy, he was not in the lowest levels either. He had no way of knowing who the ultimate users of the drugs would be. The Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that these offences were premeditated and, when he became involved, he appreciated that it was becoming and mentioned organised criminal activity. 

He had over $50,000 in the car which he has acknowledged was the proceeds of crime. This, combined with the two types of drug and the assertion in paragraph 1 of exhibit A that enquiries revealed the Offender was involved in drug supply activities indicates, that neither count 1 nor count 2 was an isolated aberration. 

There is no evidence that the Offender was living beyond his means. He was abusing drugs himself and told the probation officer about financial difficulties, but did not particularise those. His drug use and financial problems may explain but do not excuse his offending. There is evidence that his drug usage and personality disorder impacted upon his cognition and could have done so at the time of the offences. However, there is no credible evidence that he did not know what he was doing and its consequences when he committed these offences or for that matter the possession of the gun offence. 

Because of the weight of the drug and he has been involved at a wholesale level the Court found, having considered count 1 in accordance with R v Way 2004 60 NSWLR 168, that it falls around the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences under this provision. Because of his guilty plea and the finding of special circumstances the Court did not impose the standard non-parole period but used it as a guidepost. 

The Court found that count 2 falls just below the mid range."" 

24The sentencing Judge made the following finding concerning the objective seriousness of the firearm offence (ROS10): 

""He had no legitimate reason to be in possession of the pistol, his possession of it was clearly related to his drug trafficking activities and the money found in the car. That also explains why it was loaded. It was easily concealable and was self-loading. His possession of it was clearly premeditated and connected with his involvement in organised criminal activity. Having considered this matter in accordance with Way [op cit], the Court concluded that this offence falls well within the upper range of objective seriousness for offences under this particular provision."" 

Ground 1 - Suggested Error in Assessment of Objective Seriousness of the First Count 

Submissions 

25Mr Smith's written submissions contended that the sentencing Judge erred in two distinct but related ways in considering the first count. Firstly, it was said that his Honour had erroneously confined consideration of the objective seriousness to questions of drug weight and level of involvement, without taking into account the Applicant's mental condition at the time of the offence. Secondly, it was submitted that his Honour had failed to properly articulate where it was that the offence fell in terms of the range of objective seriousness. 

26In support of the first contention, Mr Smith submitted that the sentencing Judge was required to consider the Applicant's mental state when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence: R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; Buttrose v R [2011] NSWCCA 35. Mr Smith submitted that the Applicant was dealt with on the basis that he had developed a polysubstance abuse at the age of 19 years and that the Applicant suffered from a borderline personality disorder that could reflect itself in poor impulse control, and instability in mood, relationships, self confidence and behaviour. Mr Smith pointed to his Honour's finding that there was ""no credible evidence that he did not know what he was doing and its consequences when he committed these offences or for that matter the possession of the gun offence"" , but submitted that his Honour had failed to have regard to the Applicant's mental state to reduce the objective seriousness of the offences. 

27The second contention was that his Honour had erroneously described the first count as being ""around the middle"" of the range and that this finding did not provide the level of particularity required when making a finding of objective seriousness: HJWG v R [2011] NSWCCA 50 at [8]. Mr Smith submitted that this finding constituted error and that, when taken with the suggested failure to have regard to the Applicant's mental state, error had been demonstrated in accordance with the first ground of appeal. 

28In oral submissions, Mr Smith refined the challenges in the first ground to contend that his Honour's finding concerning the objective seriousness of this offence was not open. 

29Mr Smith noted that his Honour's finding that the purity of the ecstasy ranged from 44% to 61% was wrong, with these percentages of purity relating to the methylamphetamine, which was the subject of the second count. Although this issue was not the subject of a precise ground of appeal, Mr Smith sought to rely upon it under the umbrella of the first ground of appeal. 

30The Crown accepted that an offender's mental illness or intellectual disability may bear upon the objective seriousness of an offence, in the manner described in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 186-187 [85]-[86]. 

31The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had considered this question here, and had found that there was no credible evidence that the Applicant did not know what he was doing and the consequences of his acts. 

32With respect to an assessment of the range of objective seriousness of drug supply offences, the Crown referred to R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430 at [24] where a range of factors were mentioned, including the amount and purity of the drug, the number of occasions on which the drug was supplied, the motivation for the supply, the planning involved and the role of the offender in the supply. Reference was made as well to R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135 at [35], where it was said that the motive of an offender, or any condition which affects the offender's state of mind which impinges upon the elements comprised within the mens rea is of relevance, although less so in the case of any condition which is self induced through abuse of alcohol or drugs. 

33The Crown submitted that the present Applicant was engaged in wholesale supply and was more than a courier. It was submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to find that the first count involved an offence around the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 

34The Crown observed that the prosecution submission in the District Court was that the first count was in the middle range and that no contrary submission had been made by the Applicant's counsel. 

35The Crown submitted that, although this Court has reiterated on a number of occasions that, when sentencing for standard non-parole period offences, Judges ought specify the extent or degree to which an offence departs from a notional offence in the mid-range of objective seriousness ( R v Sellars [2010] NSWCCA 133 at [11]), his Honour's finding in this case of ""around"" the middle of the range did not suggest departure either up or down from the middle of the range which required identification. 

36With respect to the purity of the drugs, the Crown submitted that the passage relied upon by the Applicant (ROS5.8) contained a slip, as his Honour had identified correctly elsewhere in his remarks, the purity levels as attaching to the methylamphetamine (ROS8.9). 

37The Crown submitted that error had not been demonstrated in accordance with the first ground of appeal. 

Decision 

38This Court has emphasised that characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [46]. This Court is slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion, and the question must be whether the particular characterisation was open: Mulato v R at [37], [46]-[47]. 

39This appeal was heard before the High Court gave judgment on 5 October 2011 in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154. That decision changes the law in several respects where sentence is to be passed for an offence carrying a standard non-parole period. To the extent that a question arises whether the Applicant's mental state at the time of the offence may bear upon objective seriousness ( Muldrock at 1162-1163 [27], 1163 [29]), it remains a relevant factor on sentence in an assessment of moral culpability. Accordingly, if there is evidence to support a finding that an offender's moral culpability is reduced by a relevant mental condition, the offender is entitled to have it called in aid on sentence. The present ground of appeal will be considered in this light. 

40The Applicant's role and the quantity of the drug in the first count were central considerations in an assessment of the seriousness of the offence. 

41His Honour adverted to the evidence, such as it was, concerning the Applicant's mental state. The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. The evidence relied upon by the Applicant in this respect emanated from a psychological report. There was no psychiatric evidence before the District Court. 

42I see no error in his Honour's approach to this aspect. It should be kept in mind that the present offences disclose the Applicant being involved in significant wholesale drug supply where he was in possession of a substantial sum of money and a loaded firearm. The evidence did not demonstrate a causal relationship between the Applicant's offences and his mental state arising from polysubstance abuse and his capacity to reason or appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of his acts or to exercise appropriate powers of control. Even allowing for the Applicant's drug use as shedding some light upon how he came to be involved in serious crime of this type, I am not persuaded that these factors operate to reduce his moral culpability for these offences. 

43In my view, the misdescription of the purity as applying to the ecstasy (see [13] above) was a slip. His Honour later described (correctly) the purity percentage as applying to the methylamphetamine (see [23] above). In any event, as Mr Smith acknowledged in this Court, the ecstasy was in the form of about 700 tablets designed for supply in that form to end users, without further processing. The issue of purity is of less importance in such a case. 

44For completeness and with the decision in Muldrock in mind, I observe that his Honour had regard to the standard non-parole period as a ""guidepost"" . His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offence, and made other findings as part of an identification of relevant objective and subjective factors. Of course, assessment of the objective gravity of an offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71]. His Honour did not engage in a two-stage sentencing process. 

45It was open to the sentencing Judge to make the finding which he did concerning the objective seriousness of the first count: Mulato v R at [37], [46]. 

46In my view, the first ground ought be rejected. 

Ground 2 - The Challenge to the Assessment of Objective Seriousness of the Firearm Offence 

47This ground of appeal was abandoned at the hearing before this Court. It will still be necessary to refer to the objective seriousness of the firearm offence in considering the remaining grounds of appeal. 

Grounds 3, 4 and 5 - Challenges to Accumulation and Totality 

48It is appropriate to consider these grounds of appeal together. 

Submissions 

49Mr Smith submits that the degree of accumulation of sentences in this case is excessive so that the total effective sentence imposed is excessive. 

50Whilst accepting that there is no rule or principle that requires sentences for offences committed on the same day, or in the course of the same criminal undertaking, to be served concurrently ( Melbom v R [2011] NSWCCA 22 at [74]), and that the fact that drugs were located in the same place and at the same time, did not necessarily lead to concurrent sentences ( R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38), Mr Smith submits that a greater degree of concurrence was appropriate in this case. 

51Counsel for the Applicant submits that the sentencing Judge did not identify in what sense the first and second counts were said to be separate, so that concurrent sentences were appropriate as between those counts. 

52Mr Smith concedes that some degree of accumulation was required as between the second and third counts, but submits that the degree of accumulation is excessive in this case. 

53He submits that the overall degree of accumulation, which amounted to 25% of the overall non-parole period, was excessive in circumstances where the offences were very closely connected. 

54Mr Smith submits that the Applicant's subjective case was not appropriately reflected in the overall sentence: Mulato v R at [40]. He pointed to the 10% discount for the pleas of guilty and other subjective features, including the Applicant's family history in Iraq and Australia. He pointed as well to the sentencing Judge's assessment that the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were ""reasonable to good"" . 

55Mr Smith submitted that the Form 1 offences in this case did not justify a significant increase in the otherwise applicable penalty, and that it was not automatic that the sentence for the first count, to which the Form 1 offences attached, ought be increased: Mulato v R at [68]. 

56He submits that, with one exception, the Form 1 offences were relatively minor offences. He submitted that: 

(a) small quantities of drugs were involved in the possession offences; 

(b) the Taser in the Applicant's possession was not functioning; 

(c) the instructions relating to the manufacture of a prohibited drug were not indicative of any intent to manufacture on the Applicant's part; 

(d) possession of the ammunition was closely related to the third count; 

(e) the offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime involved a sum of money which was forfeited as part of the sentencing proceedings. 

57Mr Smith submitted that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive and that lesser sentences were warranted in law. 

58The Crown submitted that questions of concurrence or accumulation are discretionary. 

59The Crown submitted that his Honour applied the principles with respect to accumulation, concurrency and totality and that the levels of accumulation were open to the sentencing Judge in this case. 

60The Crown submitted that the sentences were not manifestly excessive when taken individually, or when viewed as a total effective sentence, so that the challenge to the sentences in this case ought be rejected. 

Decision 

61The principles to be applied with respect to concurrency, accumulation and totality were stated by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27]: 

""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both."" 

62I do not accept the Applicant's submission that, in some way, concurrent sentences were appropriate for the drug supply offences constituting the first and second counts. Although the drugs in question happened to be in the Applicant's vehicle on the same day and at the same time, different drugs were involved, being a commercial quantity of ecstasy (first count) and a significant quantity of methylamphetamine (second count). The offences were separate because the law of this State identifies these crimes as separate offences. 

63There is no expectation that a sentencing Judge will treat offences of this type as requiring concurrent sentences because the Applicant committed offences, with respect to two different drugs, at the same time. Of course, there is no rule either that accumulation should always occur in such a case. What is required is the exercise of discretion in the circumstances of the case. That is what happened here. A measure of accumulation was both open and appropriate with respect to the first and second counts. 

64The firearm offence contained in the third court required, in my view, a significant measure of accumulation and no error has been demonstrated in his Honour's approach in this respect. 

65It is appropriate to refer to sentencing principles concerning offences under s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996 . 

66In R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43; 205 A Crim R 222, the Court said at 234 [73]: 

""The policy of the legislature evinced by the enactment of the offence in s.7(1) is to deter and punish possession of firearms per se: R v Krstic [2005] NSWCCA 391 at [14]. The courts must seek to implement the legislative policy to control the possession of firearms in the community 'by honest citizens and not simply to disarm the criminally minded': R v Tolley [2004] NSWCCA 165 at [53]. As it happens, the Respondent was amongst the ranks of 'the criminally minded' through his drug supply activities."" 

67Like the Respondent in R v AZ , the present Applicant was amongst the ranks of ""the criminally minded"" through his drug supply activities. 

68It is pertinent to refer to other features of offences under s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996 which bear upon the objective seriousness of offences under that provision. In R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307, this Court said at 320-321 [88]-[89]: 

""88 The fact that the pistol was loaded, and that the Appellant possessed other ammunition, bore upon the seriousness of his crimes: R v Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 270 at [14]; R v Amurao [2005] NSWCCA 32 at [69]; Yang v R [2007] NSWCCA 37 at [18]. The Appellant's claim that he possessed the loaded pistol for his own protection was not a matter of significant, if any, mitigation, since the policy of the legislature evinced by the enactment of the offence under 7(1), with a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment, was to act as a deterrent, and to punish possession of a pistol per se: R v Krstic at [14]. The rule of law, and the authority of courts, depends upon the proposition that persons do not, by illegal means, take their protection into their own hands: R v AA [2006] NSWCCA 55 at [46]. 

89 The fact that the serial number of the pistol had been obliterated, although explicable by the criminal origin of the weapon, does not assist the Appellant, who possessed the firearm for criminal purposes: Yang v R at [18]. The fact that the Appellant possessed the pistol in a context where he was involved in the supply of drugs also bears on the objective seriousness of the pistol offence: Luu v R at [32]."" 

69The location of the firearm with ammunition, drugs and money in the Applicant's vehicle pointed to a link between the pistol and the other items. As the sentencing Judge found, the fact that the Applicant possessed the pistol, in a context where he was involved in the supply of drugs, bore on the objective seriousness of the s.7(1) offence: R v AZ at 234 [76]. 

70To my mind, the aspects of this case to which the sentencing Judge made reference all pointed to, and supported, a conclusion that the s.7(1) offence was ""well within the upper range of objective seriousness for offences"" under that section. Even though the second ground of appeal was abandoned, this finding remains important to the determination of the challenge to his Honour's approach to accumulation and totality. 

71The sentence imposed upon the Applicant in this case was a non-parole period of four years with a balance of term of two years and nine months. This sentence was appropriate in the circumstances of the case. 

72A further observation may be made concerning the Applicant's submissions in the District Court and before this Court. It was contended that his Honour had given inadequate weight to the evidence that the Applicant suffered from a borderline personality disorder that could reflect itself in poor impulse control and instability in mood. This argument is very much a two-edged sword with respect to the firearm offence. Possession of a loaded pistol by a person with poor impulse control and instability in mood gives rise to issues of public safety, the protection of the community and the need for a significant allowance for personal and general deterrence: R v Thalari at 321 [93]; s.3A(b), (c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

73The Applicant's possession of a loaded pistol required some separate and identifiable penalty for that crime. The sentence on the drug supply offences could not comprehend and reflect the criminality for the firearm offence. The offences involved discrete and independent criminal acts so that a significant measure of accumulation was appropriate for the s.7(1) offence: R v AZ at 235-236 [85]. 

74It should be kept in mind that the sentencing Judge ordered that the sentences for these offences would run concurrently with the balance of parole being served by the Applicant from 22 July 2008 to 8 April 2009, following revocation of his parole by the State Parole Authority. As his Honour explained (ROS11): 

""Each offence calls for a substantive sentence. Whilst there is some interrelationship between the three offences, they are separate and require some accumulation. Because the breach of parole has been treated as an aggravating feature for each offence and the overall length of the sentence, the Court considered that these sentences should be served concurrently with the balance of parole."" 

This discretionary determination was open to the sentencing Judge and operated favourably to the Applicant: Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145 at 149-150 [22]-[25]. 

75However, the fact that the Applicant had committed these offences whilst on parole for robbery in company and kidnapping was a significant factor to be taken into account on the question of accumulation of individual sentences as well. The Applicant was not entitled to have factors operating, by way of double counting, in a manner that was favourable to him on issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality. 

76In sentencing the Applicant for the first count, it was necessary for the sentencing Judge to have regard to the seven further offences contained in the Form 1. As his Honour observed, these offences were to be taken into account ""when considering deterrence and retribution"" in passing sentence on the first count (ROS1). 

77The sentence imposed for the first offence had to reflect the need for personal deterrence and retribution arising from the additional criminality involved in the Form 1 offences: Attorney General's Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at 159 [42]-[43]; R v Thalari at 321 [90]. 

78The Form 1 matters involved a variety of crimes. Their seriousness cannot be downplayed so as to suggest that the quantum of sentence on the first count ought not to have been increased to reflect those crimes. 

79The offence of knowingly dealing in the proceeds of crime involved a substantial sum of $50,060.85. The fact that this sum was forfeited to the State could not be taken into account as a mitigating factor on sentence: R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2; 111 A Crim R 152 at 175-176 [77]; s.24B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

80The offence of possession of a Taser-like stun device was not a minor example of an offence under s.7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 : cf R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 355; 156 A Crim R 225 at 232-233 [37]. 

81The offence of possession of a document (which the Applicant had touched) containing instructions for the manufacture of ecstasy was an unusual one, which did not assist the Applicant in an overall assessment of his association with drugs. 

82The sentencing Judge had regard to all relevant objective and subjective factors in passing sentence. 

83I am not persuaded that a total effective sentence comprising a non-parole period of eight years and an effective head sentence of 14 years is manifestly excessive. A claim of manifest excess requires the Applicant to demonstrate that the sentences were unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. Neither the individual sentences, nor their cumulative effect, were unreasonable or plainly unjust. To the contrary, the sentences were well within the proper exercise of sentencing discretion for serious drug supply and firearm offences of this type. 

84I would reject the third, fourth and fifth grounds of appeal. 
 
Conclusion and Orders 

85The Applicant has not made good any of the grounds of appeal. Even if error had been demonstrated (and it has not been), I would not be satisfied that some lesser sentence or sentences are warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 

86I propose the following orders: 

(a) leave to appeal granted; 

(b) appeal against sentence dismissed.

2708954,R v TA [2011] NSWDC 209,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Of recent times politicians have begun paying attention to the issues surrounding gambling and, more particularly, problem gambling. There is a widespread view as to the harmlessness of gambling in most cases. If those politicians spent a week in these courts I doubt that they would be able to maintain that view. Increasingly these courts see offending directly related to the problems caused by gambling. One particular scenario is becoming commonplace, a good example of it is before me today. 

2Van Hieu Ta was a gambler. He would go to the Casino and spend his money playing blackjack and the poker-machines. Of course he would lose. At the same time that he was doing this he was short of money. His business, renovating houses, was going downhill and he did not have as much work as he used to. He incurred some debts. People approached him, suggesting that they could lend money to him. He accepted their offer, but then of course he had to repay it and he learned about the high level of interest that these people, who I will accurately describe as loan sharks, required. How was he to pay back the loan? They had a way that he could do that. He could go to Vietnam and bring something back to Australia for them. 

3It was in those circumstances that the offender turned up at Sydney Airport on 4 October 2010 having flown in from Vietnam. Customs officers searched his bag, realised it was heavier than it should have been when empty and later identified that the offender was carrying in that bag a quite significant quantity of heroin, just over a kilo in gross weight and 768.3 grams of pure heroin. He was arrested and has been in custody since then. 

4That scenario that I have just described, loan sharks lending money to gamblers and then when the money cannot be repaid suggesting the importation of something into Australia, is, as I said, now commonplace. There needs to be a substantial component of general deterrence to the sentence that I impose upon this offender and so I trust will prove to be the case. 

5The offender is fifty-one years of age. He has no prior convictions. He was born in Vietnam and educated there. He did some military service and was significantly injured during the course of it. He came to Australia. He is married and has two children, one of whom is currently doing her HSC. He has proved to be an industrious person, being employed in various occupations until he set up his own business. 

6There is no explanation for him committing this offence, apart from the one I have earlier identified. He is not addicted to drugs, in fact does not use them at all. What the offender did was a cynical money-making exercise. Of course he did not precisely know what he was bringing back but he must have known it was drugs and he must have known that by doing so he would be causing a great deal of misery to those who would use the drugs he imported. 

7This is a serious offence, of course. It carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. Sentencing statistics relied on by Ms Carroll for the offender would tend to suggest that the courts have not quite been treating the offence as serious as the legislature would like, with the longest sentence imposed, according to those statistics, being less than half the maximum penalty. 

8Notwithstanding everything I have said, the offender does have good prospects of rehabilitation. His age is the most significant factor, suggesting that finding, although there is one qualification and that is the circumstance that this offence arose from his gambling, but the offender seems committed to putting his problems behind him. 

9Ms Carroll said that the offender was remorseful. Certainly he appears to be ashamed at the shame he has brought to his family, but it is less clear that he holds any remorse for the wrongfulness of what he actually did. Sometimes a plea of guilty can be demonstration of remorse, but the offender's plea of guilty came very late indeed, on the day his matter was listed for trial. There was that belated and thus limited willingness to facilitate the course of justice and so the sentence that I impose upon him will be ten per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

10The offender is depressed, as are most offenders who face the prospect of lengthy sentences of imprisonment, but the evidence would suggest that he is more depressed than most. He will do his time in custody harder than those who face the prospect of a lengthy period of imprisonment with less concern as to what is going to happen to them and what is going to happen to their family. Fortunately for the offender he is not one of those drug importers who will be serving his sentence in a country that he does not live in. His family visits him in custody and so he will not be isolated as many drug importers are. 

11The offender was travelling business class. This is a curious circumstance given that the offender's motivation in committing this offence was that he was short of money and could not repay a gambling debt. When asked why he was travelling business class he said firstly that the loan sharks had bought the ticket. Then he told a different story, he said it was better for tax. Then he told yet another story, saying that he was forced to buy a business class ticket by the loan sharks. What the truth is I simply do not know, given the various explanations that the offender offered within the space of a few minutes in the witness box. Nevertheless, the only explanation for the offender committing this offence is that he was short of money. So I will sentence him on that basis. 

12In other cases I have dealt with the issue as to what ratio a non-parole period should bear to the head sentence following the High Court decision of Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 . I need not repeat what I have said beyond noting that what is probably likely to happen is that the ratio will go down. It still remains the case, however, that the non-parole period represents the minimum that an offender must serve and one important factor in determining what that minimum is, is the objective gravity of the offender's conduct. Here that objective gravity was high indeed. He brought in a substantial amount of a very dangerous drug simply so that he could pay off a gambling debt that he had voluntarily acquired. 

13Both Madam Crown and Ms Carroll relied on what they said were similar cases. The Crown had eight and Ms Carroll had seven. Those cases can be but a selection of decisions concerning the appropriate sentences to be imposed in cases of this kind, but together I have found that helpful. I have also had regard to the maximum penalty that the legislature has provided as indicating the seriousness with which parliament expects that the courts will view offending of this kind. 

14The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five years to date from 4 October 2010 and a head sentence of nine years. The non-parole period will expire on 3 October 2015 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 

15Mr Ta, I will explain to you what has happened. You must serve at least five years in gaol, but that dates from 4 October last year, which is when you first went to gaol, so that means that the earliest that you can be released from custody is 3 October 2015, a little less than four years from today. Once you are released from custody you will be serving a sentence in the community until 3 October 2019. Do you understand what I have said to you? 

16OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

		31 January 2012",2011-11-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708955,R v DELL [2011] NSWDC 211,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: On 11 August 2009 Mr John Ciganda was home asleep in bed. He woke to see two men in his bedroom. When he swore at them they appeared to run away. Mr Ciganda followed them, but when he reached the top of a flight of stairs he was pushed from behind. He fell down the stairs injuring himself in the process. When he reached the bottom a man jumped onto his back and put a knife to his throat. Mr Ciganda attempted to push the knife away with his right hand and in doing so sustained a significant wound to one of his fingers. 

2What followed was a significant time in which Mr Ciganda must have been absolutely terrified. He was subject to threats that he would be killed, he was hog tied, his place was ransacked and he was made to remain where he was, lying in a pool of his own blood, for a lengthy period indeed. 

3The offender, for it was he who was the man with his knife to Mr Ciganda's throat, and an associate of his, stole some significant property from Mr Ciganda. They took about $16,000 in cash as well as some items of jewellery. One particular item of jewellery was of great significance to Mr Ciganda. He had his watch stolen. It was a watch that was some fifty-five years which had belonged to his father. Mr Ciganda displayed some significant emotion when he gave evidence about the loss of that watch. It obviously had a great deal of sentimental value to him. In fact he said its loss broke his heart. 

4As well as taking that property the offender also made demands for $100,000. Mr Ciganda did not have $100,000, but the offenders kept making demands. Eventually they left and over the next few days Mr Ciganda received a number of telephone calls repeating the demands that he pay $100,000, accompanied by threats as to what would happen to him and his daughters if he did not pay up. 

5After the offender and his associate left the house on 11 August 2009 Mr Ciganda called the police and he was treated in hospital for the wound to his finger. It required suturing and because of the wound's depth he required a course of therapy to assist him in being able to use that finger again. 

6I am now to sentence the offender for an offence of break enter and steal in circumstances of special aggravation, the offender having belatedly pleaded guilty to that offence. The circumstances of special aggravation relied on by the Crown are that Mr Ciganda was deprived of his liberty and wounded. That of course relates to the events that occurred in Mr Ciganda's home. But when I sentence him for that offence the offender asked that I take into account another offence, that being an offence of demanding money with menaces with intent to steal that money, and that relates to the later demands made of Mr Ciganda that he pay them $100,000. As I said, this plea of guilty came very late indeed, it was on the third day of the offender's trial when the Crown case was about to close. The Crown case was an overwhelming one. It was circumstantial but as judges sometimes tell juries circumstantial evidence can be the best evidence of all. 

7The circumstances relied on by the Crown were these. The man in the house told Mr Ciganda to call him ""Bob"". Mr Ciganda said that at the time Bob was in his house Bob made numerous telephone calls on his mobile phone. And the offender's mobile phone records show that he made a whole series of calls on that phone, at about the same time Bob was making calls from Mr Ciganda's house. Secondly, the mobile phone tower which picked up the offender's phone when those calls were made was close to Mr Ciganda's house. Thirdly, two calls later made to Mr Ciganda's landline and mobile phones came from a public phone near to where the offender worked. And fourthly CCTV footage show the offender using one of those public phones at the same time as Mr Ciganda received a call from Bob. As I say the Crown case was an overwhelming one. 

8The maximum penalty for the offence to which the offender has now pleaded guilty is twenty-five years imprisonment. It carries with it a standard non-parole period. I have taken both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period into account in formulating the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence. 

9One of the things which makes this offence so serious is the very lengthy period over which it took place. Mr Ciganda's recollection as to the time was clearly based on his assessment, affected of course as it was by the terror that he was feeling and the threats to which he had been subject. But mobile phone records suggest that it was a period of more than two hours that the offender held Mr Ciganda prisoner in his own home. At times the offender threatened to kill Mr Ciganda and he backed up those threats by holding the knife to Mr Ciganda's throat. There was a significant amount of property taken and the loss to Mr Ciganda was substantial. The wound of course could have been worse but it was a significant injury requiring not just stiches but therapy as well in order that Mr Ciganda could regain use of his middle finger. Of course as Mr Marr suggests, I take into account that whilst easily foreseeable that the use of the knife would cause serious injury and a wound, the actual wound occurred when Mr Ciganda attempted to push the knife away. In that sense it was not intended by the offender. 

10Quite why Mr Ciganda was targeted is difficult to understand. The evidence that I heard would suggest he was a law abiding builder. He does not appear to have been living an extravagant lifestyle, and it may well be that his premises were selected at random or through a mistake. Equally puzzling is why the offender did it. The offender did not give evidence either at trial or in the sentence proceedings, so I couldn't ask him why he did it. But somewhat surprisingly a psychologist who prepared a report at the request of the offender's solicitors did not ask him either. I am left completely in the dark as to what motivated the offender to commit this very serious crime. I am left in the dark as to whether the offender was the principal, the leading force or whether he was merely a foot soldier. 

11The offender was born in Lebanon, he is now forty eight years of age. He came to Australia when he was about four or five and had some difficulties settling into a foreign country with a new language. His parents have recently returned to Lebanon. The offender went to school in Australia, stopping his education in Year 10 in order that he could work. Since that time he has held a number of jobs in various capacities including owning fruit market and coffee shop businesses. In fact the offender was running a caf at the time he committed these offences. Shortly after the offence he closed the cafe down and was working in traffic control at the time of his arrest. 

12The offender has had two significant relationships. The first ended after a number of years and produced three children. The separation appears to have been acrimonious and the offender has had no contact with his children of that marriage for some time. The offender's current partner, whom he met while he ran a fruit shop, has recently given birth to a child, indeed she was heavily pregnant at the time of the trial and these sentencing proceedings were delayed and bail was granted to the offender so that he could be present at the birth of their child. The author of the presentence report reports that Mr Dell described his relationship with his present wife as mutually supportive. His wife is in court today together with their very young child. 

13The presentence report says that Mr Dell claimed that he was coerced by people assumed to be involved in organised crime to commit the offences. But there was no evidence from the offender to back up that assertion. He did not expose himself to cross-examination on that claim. This is one of the reasons, as I said earlier, that I'm completely in the dark as to a number of aspects as to what led to this offence being committed. Another reason that the sentencing proceedings have been a bit delayed concerns the question of assistance to the authorities. Today I received an affidavit and annexed to that affidavit is a statement of the officer-in-charge of this matter. It concerns information given to the authorities by the offender after he pleaded guilty. He has promised to give evidence against one person whom the police believe was involved in the offence and who has been charged with it, and he has also promised to give evidence against others. On top of that, the assistance has allowed police to identify a criminal network. There was some controversy between the Crown and counsel for the offender as to the value of the assistance. Indeed there seems to have been some controversy between the Crown and the police officer as to the value of that assistance and so the police officer was called to give evidence. It may well be that in some respects what the offender has told police contradicts other evidence. But simply because that weakens the Crown case against someone does not mean that the assistance is not valuable. Assisting the authorities does not just mean making a Crown case stronger. If, in truth, the Crown case is based on a misunderstanding then it is of assistance to the authorities if the offender tells the truth and exposes the misunderstanding. 

14I will not separately quantify the discount that I have allowed for assistance to the authorities from the discount that I have allowed for the very late plea of guilty. I repeat, as I have said many times now, the plea of guilty came almost at the end of the Crown case, and so the utilitarian value of that plea is very limited indeed, it saved perhaps a day or two of Court time but that is about it. 

15Combining the discounts for the late plea of guilty and the assistance I will impose upon the offender a sentence which is 25 per cent less than it would otherwise have been. Of course one of the factors that is encompassed by that discount is the possibility that the offender will serve part or all of his sentence in protective custody, which carries with it the risk that his conditions of custody will be harder than those in the general prison population. Another thing that will make the offender's time in gaol harder is the circumstance that he will be deprived of being able to live with his wife and new child. His behaviour in Court has clearly suggested that this will be a matter of some significance to him. The offender will also know that through his criminal behaviour he has deprived his wife and new child of his care and support for a number of years. 

16The offender has a criminal history but it is either relatively minor or old. He has certainly never served a gaol sentence before. It is a significant matter to send someone to gaol for the first time at the age of forty-eight. 

17I mentioned the report of Mr Watson-Munro before. Another aspect of that report concerns the diagnosis that Mr Watson-Munro made of post-traumatic stress disorder arising from an event which occurred thirty-five years ago. The report expresses the view that that event and the subsequent effect of the event upon the offender, has been a significant aspect of his life. Mr Watson-Munro suggests that the post-traumatic stress disorder would lead to reduced judgment and impulse control. I will accept that as a general proposition but I do note that the link between committing the offence and any post-traumatic stress disorder is a bit of a matter of speculation given the lack of information that I have as to why the offender committed the offence in the first place. It may, or it may not, result from reduced judgment and impulse control. I simply do not know. Indeed Mr Watson-Munro's report suffered from being prepared with no real knowledge of what the offender actually did. The report does suffer from a lack of context. 

18There are special circumstances in this case, the offender will be serving his first time in custody and will be assisted by supervision of the Probation and Parole Service upon his release. 

19It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence has to reflect the objective gravity of what an offender did. What the offender did to Mr Ciganda was seriously criminal. To hold someone hog tied in their own blood while making threats to kill over a period of two hours, after having invaded that person's home with another and whilst armed with a knife is very serious criminal conduct indeed. A lengthy sentence must be imposed to reflect the objective gravity of that conduct. 

20The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. Taking into account the matter on the Form 1, I set a non-parole period of four years to date from 18 October 2011, and a head sentence of six and a half years. The non-parole period will expire on 17 October 2015 upon which date the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 

21I recommend that Mr Dell be placed in protection immediately and that I will ask that that be endorsed upon the warrant.

		31 January 2012",2011-11-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708984,Morse v Al-Jubouri [2011] NSWSC 1330,"Judgment 

1Pursuant to s 56(1)(e) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Appeal and Review Act""), the plaintiff, David Morse, representing the Office of State Revenue (""the OSR""), appeals against an order made in the Local Court on 8 March 2011 that he pay the costs of summary proceedings brought on behalf of the OSR against the defendant, Mahmoud Al-Jubouri. (The judgment shows as ""the date of decision"" 24 February 2011. The parties were agreed that the correct date is 8 March 2011). 

2At the outset it is convenient to note an anomaly in the legislation governing the appeal. Section 56 of the Appeal and Review Act provides for an appeal to this Court against certain orders of the Local Court. It is in the following terms: 

""56 Appeals as of right 
(1) The prosecutor may appeal to the Supreme Court against: 

(a) a sentence imposed by the Local Court in any summary proceedings, or 

(b) an order made by the Local Court that stays any summary proceedings for the prosecution of an offence, or 

(c) an order made by the Local Court dismissing a matter the subject of any summary proceedings, or 

(d) an order for costs made by a Magistrate against the prosecutor in any committal proceedings, or 

(e) an order for costs made by the Local Court against the prosecutor in any summary proceedings, 

other than an order or sentence with respect to an environmental offence, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone. 

(2) ... "" 

3The proceedings brought by the OSR in the Local Court were summary proceedings. It therefore has an appeal as of right to this Court pursuant to s 56(1)(e). 

4Section 59 specifies the orders that this Court may make upon appeal under s 56. Subsection (2) provides: 

""(2) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to in section 56 (1) (b), (c) or (d) or 57 (1) (b) or (c): 

(a) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just, or 

(b) by dismissing the appeal."" 

5It is here that the anomaly arises. It will be seen that, while s 59 is specific as to the orders that this Court may make with respect to an appeal against orders of the kinds referred to in s 56(1) (b), (c) or (d), it is silent as to the orders this Court may make with respect to appeals against orders of the kind here in question, under s 56(1)(e). (Appeals of the kind referred to in s 56(1)(a) are the subject of s 59(1).) 

6The parties are agreed (probably correctly) that this is no more than a legislative oversight. However, it poses the question: what orders can the court make with respect to an appeal against orders of the kind here in question? If the maxims expressio unius personae vel rei est exclusio alterius , or expressum facit cessare tacitum are applied, then the orders this Court specifically cannot make are of the kind mentioned in s 59(2)(a) - setting aside the order (under s 59(2)(b)) and substituting another; even more anomalously, it could not make an order dismissing the appeal. With all the limitations these maxims have, this would seem to be an appropriate instance of the application of one or the other. Even on the warranted assumption that the explanation for the exclusion of s 56(1)(e) is legislative oversight, there is no basis on which the court could remedy the situation by reading into the statute words that were not enacted by the legislature. 

7This is plainly a matter calling for legislative reform. 

8I now turn to the substance of the appeal. 

Background 

9On 24 October 2005, pursuant to s 7 of the First Homeowner Grant Act 2000, Mr Al-Jubouri applied for a first homeowner's grant, in respect of a property he had purchased, or intended to purchase, at 74 Harris Street, Merrylands. The grant was duly made. It entitled Mr Al-Jubouri to a cash payment of $7,000, and to exemptions with respect to stamp and mortgage duties under the Taxation Administration Act 1996. Pursuant to s 12 of the First Homeowner Grant Act , the grant was conditional upon a ""residence requirement"", requiring Mr Al-Jubouri, within 12 months of completion of the purchase, to commence occupation of the home as his principal place of residence, and to occupy the home for a continuous period of at least six months (unless the Chief Commissioner of State Revenue approved some variation of either of those periods). 

10The purchase was completed on 5 December 2005. Mr Al-Jubouri was therefore required to take up occupation by 5 December 2006, and remain continuously in residence until six months after the occupation date (the Chief Commissioner not having approved any variation). 

11It is the practice of the OSR to make certain routine inquiries to ensure that recipients of first homeowner grants continue to satisfy the residence requirement. One means by which this is done is to obtain from the recipient of the grant a statutory declaration confirming occupancy; another is to make checks with instrumentalities such as the Roads and Traffic Authority to ascertain whether recipients' addresses, as contained in any motor vehicle driver's licences held by them, have been given as the address of the premises the subject of the grant. Inquiries are also made of other agencies, including energy suppliers, banks and insurance companies. 

12Such routine inquiries made in respect of the grant to Mr Al-Jubouri led officers of the OSR to believe or suspect that he may not, in the relevant time, have occupied the home. 

13On 4 November 2007, Mr Al-Jubouri made and presented to the OSR a statutory declaration pursuant to the Oaths Act 1900. He declared that he had lived in the home ""for more than 12 months from 09/12/05 - 03/07."" He attached various documents (for example, Integral Energy accounts) to the declaration. The first of the Integral Energy accounts, with a date due of Monday 5 June 2006, showed an amount owing of $136.80; the second, which a due date of Wednesday 6 December 2006, showed an amount owing of $153.60. The statutory declaration was, on the OSR's case, false in material respects, and gave rise to a charge under the Oaths Act (see [18] below). 

14On a date that I cannot ascertain from the materials provided to me, Mr Al-Jubouri was interviewed (through an interpreter) by Mr Morse. A record was made of the interview. 

15After these investigations, Mr Al-Jubouri was charged with four offences. These were: 

(a) an offence against s 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 of making a false statement to obtain money or financial advantage; 

(b) an offence against s 25A of the Oaths Act of making a false declaration for material benefit; 

(c) an offence against s 55(b) of the Taxation Administration Act of knowingly giving false or misleading information to a tax officer; 

(d) an offence against s 44(1)(b) of the First Homeowner Grant Act of knowingly giving false or misleading information. 

The hearing in the Local Court 

16The hearing of the charges commenced in the Downing Centre Local Court on 9 August 2010, and proceeded over that and the following day. Mr Morse, representing the OSR, was identified as the prosecutor. I will, however, refer to the proceedings as though initiated by the OSR. Evidence was called from a variety of prosecution witnesses, including Mr Morse. The case sought to be made by the OSR was circumstantial. 

17At the outset, the OSR tendered a ""Brief of Evidence"" that was marked as Exhibit 1. That bundle of documents was not put before this Court in its entirety, although some documents were separately tendered. Some of what was contained in Exhibit 1 can be gleaned from the oral evidence, the transcript of some of which was in evidence. I note that the final day of transcript that was in evidence in this Court is 10 August 2010; that transcript shows that the matter was adjourned to 29 October 2010. No transcript for that day is in evidence in this Court. At that time, the cross-examination of Mr Al-Jubouri was under way but was incomplete. 

18The evidence adduced by the OSR in the Local Court included the statutory declaration made by Mr Al-Jubouri on 4 November 2007, to which were attached the two tax invoices from Integral Energy, for 5 June 2005 and 6 December 2005, showing a consumption of electricity resulting in charges of, respectively, $136.80 and $153.60. An officer of Integral Energy gave evidence that the invoices actually issued to Mr Al-Jubouri for those dates showed amounts owing of, respectively, $36.28 and $36.76. From this evidence, the OSR sought to establish that Mr Al-Jubouri had falsified the invoices attached to the statutory declaration, and, more importantly perhaps, that the consumption of electricity at his premises was not consistent with his occupation of the house. 

19The OSR also called evidence intended to establish that Mr Al-Jubouri had given, as his postal address (to Integral Energy and others) a post office box number that was held by a friend of his, Ms Ronak Wali, who gave evidence in the prosecution case. Ms Wali said that she had visited Mr Al-Jubouri at the property, that the property was in a derelict and dirty condition and that Mr Al-Jubouri told her that he intended to clean out a garage or shed, attached to the house, to use as his living quarters. She continued to visit him after he had done so, and observed that he had only very basic cooking facilities. 

20The record of the interview conducted by Mr Morse with Mr Al-Jubouri was referred to and initially tendered in the prosecution case, but, after criticism by the magistrate, the tender was withdrawn. 

21Mr Morse said in his evidence that Mr Al-Jubouri had told him that he had been living in his car. 

22During the course of cross-examination of Ms Wali, the solicitor representing Mr Al-Jubouri produced and tendered a ""COPS"" (NSW Police Force) report of a break-in alleged to have taken place at the Harris Street premises between 3.00 pm on 28 October 2006, and 11.00 am on 30 October. The report of the break-in was recorded as having been made by ""Anna Aljubovic"". The victim was identified as Mr Al-Jubouri; his address was given as ""31 Gibbons Street, Auburn"". That, according to Ms Wali, was an address previously occupied by Mr Al-Jubouri. 

23The COPS report contained a checklist to be completed by the reporting officers. In answer to a question ""Are Premises Usually Vacant"", the officers recorded ""Yes"". In a short statement of relevant facts and circumstances they recorded: ""No persons on premises during the incident as premise is vacant."" It is not clear from this document who or what was the source of the information behind these answers. 

24On 10 August Mr Al-Jubouri gave evidence. He said that the house was in extremely poor and dilapidated condition, so poor as to be uninhabitable. He said that initially he lived in the house, but that it was vermin infested, and that, eventually, he cleaned out the garage and lived in it, for approximately a year and a half. He was working long hours in the construction industry. He had a single bed, a small gas cooking device, a toaster, and four chairs. He said that he visited friends, at whose homes he showered. He had no heating in the garage. He gave an explanation of having given the address that he did. He said that he could not write English and had not himself prepared the statutory declaration. Mr Al-Jubouri said that he had been working extremely long hours, as many as 16 or 17 in a day, up to 6 days a week. His English is extremely limited. 

25Mr Al-Jubouri was cross-examined about the interview in which he had participated. However, after the magistrate expressed concerns about the circumstances in which it was conducted, its tender was withdrawn. 

26It seems that Mr Al-Jubouri also produced evidence from the file of the local Council. This apparently disclosed that he had made an application, with the support of a neighbour, to remove certain trees on the property; and that he had submitted a development application, seeking approval to demolish the existing house and rebuild. (I say ""apparently"" because there is no reference in the incomplete transcript provided to this Court to the Council records. Reference was made to the records in the judgment under appeal.) 

27It emerged in cross-examination of Mr Al-Jubouri that, over a four year period, he had claimed CentreLink benefits, whilst in employment. He admitted this to be the case. 

28On 29 November 2010, the magistrate dismissed all four charges, giving reasons. In this appeal the OSR does not seek to challenge that decision. It is, however, necessary to refer briefly to the reasons. 

Reasons for Acquittal 

29The reasons given for the dismissal of all charges were brief. The magistrate referred to the evidence that Mr Al-Jubouri used Ms Wali's address for various purposes, but held that that was insufficient to raise an inference that he was residing in her premises. He made a similar finding in relation to the use of very small amounts of electricity, noting Mr Al-Jubouri's long work hours, and the poor condition of the property. He seems to have accepted evidence that it was a friend of Mr Al-Jubouri, not Mr Al-Jubouri himself, who falsified the Integral Energy records, for the purpose of addressing the requirements of OSR investigation. 

30He noted Mr Al-Jubouri's admission of having received CentreLink benefits to which he was not entitled. 

31He concluded that the circumstantial case presented by the OSR was insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Al-Jubouri had not occupied the premises, as required. That being the case, most of the charges failed. However, the magistrate separately considered whether Mr Al-Jubouri knew that the statutory declaration he had sent to the OSR was a false instrument. He accepted the evidence that Mr Al-Jubouri is illiterate in the English language and he was therefore not satisfied to the requisite degree that Mr Al-Jubouri knew that the statutory declaration was false. He accordingly dismissed all charges. He made no reference in this judgment to the evidence of Mr Al-Jubouri's tree removal and development applications to the local Council. 

The application for costs 

32On the acquittal of Mr Al-Jubouri, an application on his behalf was made for costs. Such an application is governed by s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act , which is in the following terms: 

214 Limit on award of professional costs to accused person against prosecutor acting in public capacity 

(1) Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following: 
(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner, 
(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner, 
(c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought, 
(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs. 
(2) ... 
(3) ..."" 

33No additional evidence was adduced on the costs application. Both parties made submissions. 

34On 8 March 2011 the magistrate gave judgment, ordering the plaintiff to pay Mr Al-Jubouri's costs. It is that judgment against which the OSR appeals. 

The magistrate's reasons for making a costs order against the OSR 

35The magistrate briefly noted the evidence adduced by the OSR in the prosecution. In this judgment he made particular reference to the evidence derived from the Council file. (He had made no reference to that evidence in the judgment dismissing the charges.) This was, as he noted it, a letter to the Council countersigned by a neighbour, stating Mr Al-Jubouri's intention to apply to remove trees from the home, and a development application, dated 30 May 2006, by Mr Al-Jubouri, seeking consent to the construction of a new dwelling. 

36Under the heading: 

""Did the prosecutor unreasonably fail to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought?"", 

(a clear reference to s 214(1)(c)), the magistrate identified the issue for determination as: 

""13. ... whether the documents [the Council documents concerning the removal of trees and the development application obtained from the Council] give rise to a relevant matter; and if so, whether the prosecutor ought reasonably to have been aware of the matter, and if so whether the matter suggested that Mr Al-Jubouri was not guilty or that proceedings should not be brought."" 

He held that those documents did give rise to a relevant matter with respect to the residence requirement. He then said: 

""14 Mr Morse had access to the council records, and ought to have been aware of the application [for development]. The application for development consent indicated that Mr Al-Jubouri intended to build on the home, and as such suggested that the home was his principal place of residence. 

15 The fact that Mr Al-Jubouri applied to Council to remove trees and develop the property suggested that he was not guilty. It provided an explanation for the low consumption of electricity. It also provided an explanation as to why he used the address of Ms Wali to conduct his business."" 

37Under a second heading: 

""Was the investigation into the alleged offence was [sic] conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner"", 

(a clear reference to s 214(1)(a)), the magistrate observed that there was no evidence that Mr Morse ever went to the property and said that he (Mr Morse) had confined his investigations to compiling information obtained from other agencies as to the address used by Mr Al-Jubouri to conduct his business, and the history of electricity usage. 

He then said: 

""17 If Mr Morse had gone to the property he would have obtained information about the state of the property. He might have interviewed neighbours. The information Mr Morse would glean from such a visit would have provided him with information to suggest that the proceedings should not have been brought."" 

Finally, he said: 

""18. The investigation was also conducted in an improper manner with respect to the interview of Mr Al-Jubouri."" 

He did not elaborate upon or identify the impropriety; the finding harked back to his earlier criticism, (see [25] above) which had caused the withdrawal of the record of the interview from evidence. 

He therefore concluded: 

""19. The prosecutor: 

(1) Failed to investigate a relevant matter of which it ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested that Mr Al-Jubouri might not be guilty. 

(2) Conducted the investigation in an improper manner. 

(3) Conducted the investigation in an unreasonable manner. 

These were findings, respectively, under s 214(1)(c) and (a), and provided the foundation for a costs order. 

38He therefore ordered the OSR to pay Mr Al-Jubouri's costs of the proceedings. It is to be noted that he made no finding, one way or the other, as to whether Mr Al-Jubouri did live in the premises. 

The grounds of appeal. 

39The grounds of appeal are pleaded in the summons as follows: 

""[The magistrate] 

(a) erred at law in finding that it was unreasonable for the Plaintiff (prosecutor) not to access council documents and [to] conclude from such documents that Mr Al-Jubouri resided in the premises when there was no evidence that such documents suggested he did live there under circumstances where there was significant evidence to support a finding that Mr Al-Jubouri did not live in the premises; 

(b) erred at law in finding that it was unreasonable for the Plaintiff (prosecutor) not to speak to Mr Al-Jubouri's neighbours to investigate whether he did live in the premises when there was no evidence that such inquiries would have been productive and in circumstances where there was significant evidence to support a finding that Mr Al-Jubouri did not live in the premises; 

(c) erred at law in giving no reasons for finding that the conduct of the Plaintiff's participation in an interview with Mr Al-Jubouri was improper; 

(d) erred at law in giving no reasons for finding that the conduct of the Plaintiff in commencing and maintaining the prosecution against Mr Al-Jubouri was unreasonable."" 

The evidence on appeal 

40The evidence on the appeal suffered from considerable deficiencies. It did not include a large amount of material, including some transcript of evidence that was before the Magistrate. It consisted of an affidavit affirmed by the solicitor for Mr Al-Jubouri (who appeared for him in the Local Court), annexing copies of the transcript of the hearing of 9 and 10 August, and submissions made to the magistrate, as well as the judgment on costs, and two affidavits affirmed by a solicitor in the employ of the Crown Solicitor's Office, representing the OSR. To the second affidavit was annexed the statutory declaration made by Mr Al-Jubouri on 4 November 2007, six tax invoices issued by Integral Energy to Mr Al-Jubouri, six tax invoices issued by Integral Energy to Ms Wali, and the COPS report referred to at [22-23] above. To the earlier affidavits were annexed the transcript of the argument in relation to costs, and the judgment awarding costs. Notably absent was any transcript of proceedings on 29 October, and any documentary evidence tendered that day. 

Questions of law on appeal 

41Bearing in mind that an appeal under s 56 of the Appeal and Review Act is limited to grounds involving a question of law alone, significant questions arise in relation to grounds (a) and (b). 

42Ground (a) is based upon an express premise that is false. The premise is that the magistrate made a finding of fact that Mr Al-Jubouri resided in the premises. As I have mentioned above, the magistrate made no finding, either that Mr Al-Jubouri did or did not live in the premises. In the primary judgment of 29 November 2010, dismissing the charges, he said: 

""The circumstantial evidence is insufficient when considered together to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Al-Jubouri did not occupy as his principal place of residence, 74 Harris Street, Merrylands for a continuous period of six months, commencing within 12 months of settlement."" 

43Nor is there any such finding in the judgment of 8 March 2011, the subject of the appeal. In any case, even if he had made such a finding, it would have been a clear finding of fact, unreviewable under s 56. 

44However, that premise can be excised from the ground, without disturbing its essential meaning. 

45The greatest difficulty, and this applies equally to ground (b), is whether it raises a question of law, as required by s 56. At issue are the findings of the magistrate that (a) it was unreasonable for the OSR to fail to obtain access to Council documents that would have revealed Mr Al-Jubouri's two applications (for tree removal and development); and (b) that it was unreasonable for the OSR to fail to make inquiries of neighbours of Mr Al-Jubouri as to his residence (or otherwise). Issues of reasonableness have the appearance of questions of fact, not law. 

46In written submissions, counsel for the OSR acknowledged the need to establish that the grounds do raise questions of law, and argued: 

""16. The [OSR] submits ... that [the magistrate] misconstrued the relevant provisions of s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act by not having regard to the relevant prosecution evidence in determining whether one or more other inquiries should have been made and would have suggested innocence on the part of [Mr Al-Jubouri]."" 

47In his written submissions, counsel for Mr Al-Jubouri conceded as much. He said: 

""4.3 There is no issue that a question of law is raised in the [OSR's] summons. The submission ... that [the magistrate] ' misconstrued the relevant provisions ' of s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 by ' not having regard to the relevant prosecution evidence in determining whether one or more other inquiries should have been made ' clearly raises a ' question of law ' ... "". 

48Both the submission and the concession suffer from a flaw in reasoning. Failure to have regard to relevant prosecution evidence does not establish misconstruction of statutory provisions. I any event, I am not persuaded that the concession is properly made. In Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139, Glass JA, with whom Samuels JA agreed, referred to a number of previous decisions. One of these was McPhee v S Bennett Ltd (1935) 52 WN(NSW) 8 at [9], in which it was said that the question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law; however: 

""But if there is evidence of the fact, the question whether that evidence ought to be accepted in whole or in part, or ought to be accepted as sufficient to establish the fact, is itself a question of fact and not a question of law, unless, of course, there is some law which provides that the particular evidence, when given, is to be taken to establish the fact. If a Tribunal which has exclusive jurisdiction to determine facts decides that it does not accept the evidence tendered as establishing a particular fact, its decision, apart from the exceptional case which I have just mentioned, is conclusive. In that case the party upon whom the burden of proving the fact lies must fail. There is no rule of law that such a Tribunal must believe the evidence because it is all one way. It can accept all, or some, or none of it."" 

Another decision to which Glass JA referred was Clark v Flanagan [1934] HCA 73; 52 CLR 416, in which Dixon J (as he then was) said: 

""The initial burden of proof is upon the applicant and the question whether he has so completely discharged it as to make a finding to the contrary unreasonable is not a question of law."" 

A third decision was De Gioia v Darling Island Stevedoring & Lighterage Co Ltd (1941) 42 SR(NSW) 1 at [5] in which it was said: 

""...If the jury find for the plaintiff, and the Full Court rules that the rebutting evidence is overwhelming, it is expressing the opinion that the defendant was, as a matter of fact, not of law, entitled to a verdict."" 

49Of these decisions, Glass JA said: 

"" It is clear from these extracts that numerous pejorative expressions in common usage possess a single meaning and are interchangeable. To say of a finding that it is perverse, that it is contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence, that it is against the evidence and the weight of the evidence, that it ignores the probative force of the evidence which is all one way or that no reasonable person could have made it, is to say the same thing in different ways. Upon proof that the finding of a jury is vitiated in this way, it will be set aside because it is wrong in fact. Since the Act does not allow this Court to correct errors of fact, any argument that the finding of a Workers' Compensation Commission judge is vitiated in the same way discloses no error of law and will not constitute a valid ground of appeal. It is also pointless to submit that the reasoning by which the court arrived at a finding of fact was demonstrably unsound as this would not amount to an error of law: R v District Court of the Metropolitan District Holden at Sydney; Exparte White [1966] HCA 69; 116 CLR 644 at 654 . 

A finding of fact in the Commission may nevertheless reveal an error of law where it appears that the trial judge has misdirected himself ie has defined otherwise than in accordance with law the question of fact which he has to answer. A possibility of this kind exists with ultimate findings of fact but not with respect to primary findings of fact such as whether the applicant suffered injury on a particular date. Further an ultimate finding of fact, even in the absence of a misdirection, may reveal error of law if the primary facts found are necessarily within or outside a statutory description and a contrary decision has been made, Hope v Bathurst City Council [[1980] HCA 16]; 144 CLR 1 at 10; Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR(NSW) 126 at 138..."" 

50Both counsel referred to the decision of the High Court in Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Limited [1996] HCA 36; 186 CLR 389 and, in particular, the High Court's acceptance (at p 395) of five propositions, drawn from Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Limited (1993) 43 FCR 280. Those propositions were stated as follows: 

""1. The question whether a word or phrase of a statute is to be given its ordinary meaning or some technical or other meaning is a question of law. 

2. The ordinary meaning of a word or its non-legal technical meaning is a question of fact. 

3. The meaning of a technical legal term is a question of law. 

4. The effect or construction of a term whose meaning or interpretation is established is a question of law. 

5. The question whether facts fully found fall within the provision of a statutory enactment properly construed is generally a question of law"" (internal citations omitted). 

51Agfa-Gevaert , like the present case, involved an appeal limited to questions of law. As can be gleaned from the five propositions stated, the specific question in that case involved the construction of particular terminology in a statutory instrument. Propositions 1 - 4 are directed to that question, and have no real bearing upon the present question. Proposition 5 is material, but was qualified in Pozzolanic . The High Court appears to have approved the qualification. The qualification was stated in Agfa-Gevaert as: 

""...when a statute uses words according to their ordinary meaning and it is reasonably open to hold that the facts of the case fall within those words, the question as to whether they do or do not is one of fact."" 

52In adopting proposition 5, the High Court was echoing something that had been said by Fullagar J in Hayes v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1956] HCA 21; 96 CLR 47, quoting Farmer v Cotton's Trustees (1915) AC 922 as follows: 

""The views from time to time expressed in this House have been far from unanimous, but in my humble judgment where all the material facts are fully found, and the only question is whether the facts are such as to bring the case within the provisions properly construed of some statutory enactment, the question is one of law only."" 

Fullagar J considered that this was ""the only reasonable view"". 

53In the same case, in a passage also endorsed by the High Court in Agfa-Gevaert , Fullagar J said: 

""The distinction between the two classes of question is, I think, greatly simplified, if we bear in mind the distinction, so clearly drawn by Wigmore between the factum probandum (the ultimate fact in issue) and facta probantia (the facts adduced to prove or disprove that ultimate fact). ... Where the factum probandum involves a term used in a statute, the question whether the accepted facta probantia establish that factum probandum will generally - so far as I can see, always - be a question of law."" (p 51). 

The qualification to proposition 5 appears to me to be to the same effect as the last sentences extracted from Azzopardi . Put another way, if the facts found are capable of giving rise to the conclusion or finding of fact (capacity to do so being a question of law) whether to do so is a question of fact. 

54In a later passage in Agfa-Gevaert , relied upon by counsel for the OSR, the High Court said: 

"" All that is required for a reviewable question of law to be raised is for a phrase to be identified as being used in a sense different from that which it has in ordinary speech."" 

In my opinion, the reliance upon this passage was misplaced. There is no phrase used in s 214 which is identified as being used in a sense different from that which it has in ordinary speech. The relevant phrases are: 

""that the investigation...was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner""; ""that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate...any relevant matter ..."". 

55There is no reason to think that these collocations of words ought not be given their ordinary meaning. That is why propositions 1 - 4 of Agfa-Gevaert also are not presently material. 

56It is also to be observed that, while the statutory terminology in question is of reasonableness or impropriety of conduct, ""unreasonableness"" in particular, is a qualitative or evaluative concept, and, it seems to me, not the kind of concept the High Court had in mind when, in proposition 5, it referred to ""the provision of a statutory enactment properly construed."" 

57If the above analysis is applied to the present case, the following results. The factum probandum in relation to ground (a) is the (asserted) unreasonableness of the OSR in failing to investigate the Council's records; in relation to ground (b) it is the (asserted) unreasonableness of the OSR in failing to make inquiries of Mr Al-Jubouri's neighbours. 

58The facta probantia upon which the Magistrate relied are: 


Ground (a): 
the application by Mr Al-Jubouri for permission to remove trees; 
the application for development consent; 
the existence of Council records that would have disclosed those applications; 
the access OSR could have had to the Council records; 

Ground (b): 
that there were neighbours in Harris Street; 
the neighbours may have been able to supply information about Mr Al-Jubouri's occupation (or otherwise) of the property; 
that the OSR could have gone to the vicinity and made inquiries of those neighbours; 
that the OSR did not do so. 

59If the Hayes approach is to be taken, the question whether the facta probantia in each case established the factum probandum is a question of law reviewable under s 56 of the Appeal and Review Act . But if the qualified Pozzolanic proposition 5 is to be applied, the task for this Court is to identify whether the evidence adduced was capable of establishing unreasonableness in either of the relevant respects. If it is so capable, then the ultimate finding is one of fact, and therefore unreviewable. 

60I also bear in mind that passage in Azzopardi (the last sentence in the first paragraph extracted above) that exclude as a question of law, an attack upon the reasoning process. 

61Although I maintain some doubt, given the concession made on behalf of Mr Al-Jubouri, the consequent absence of argument on the question, and the difficulties of drawing a clear distinction between questions of fact and questions of law, I consider that the appropriate course to take in this case is to treat each of the grounds as raising a question of law by doing so should not be taken as endorsement of any proposition that an attack on a finding of reasonableness of itself raises a question of law. 

Ground (a) 

62The findings giving rise to ground (a) are directed to s 214(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Act . That section is concerned, not only with unreasonable failure to investigate a matter of which the prosecutor was or ought to have been aware; the ""matter"" must be such as to suggest either that the accused person might not be guilty, or that, for any other reason, the proceedings ought not to have been brought. The magistrate was fully aware of these questions, and addressed himself to them. 

63The Council records were not in evidence on the appeal. Nor were the two applications referred to in the primary judgment. They are mentioned only in the judgment on costs, and relied on as evidence that suggested that Mr Al-Jubouri was not guilty (of which offence or offences is not specified) and which the OSR unreasonably failed to investigate. 

64All that is known of the applications is what is to be found in the costs judgment of 8 March 2011, the subject of the appeal. That makes it difficult to evaluate whether the facts found fall within the terminology of sub-para (c). But, it seems to me, the complaint of the OSR, properly characterised, is that (using the language of Farmer , and of proposition 5 in Agfa-Gevaert ), the facts were not ""fully found"". Both the primary judgment and the costs judgment are brief, and make little, if any, reference to aspects of the prosecution case. These aspects include the asserted falsification of the Integral Energy accounts, the use of other addresses by Mr Al-Jubouri and the information provided to police recorded on the COPS document. 

65Counsel who appeared for Mr Al-Jubouri on the appeal recognised the difficulty, describing the Magistrate's finding that Mr Al-Jubouri's applications for tree removal and development suggested occupation as distinct from ownership as ""a long bow to draw"". This concession was well made. If it were not for the explicit ruling by Glass JA in Azzopardi that ""demonstrably unsound reasoning does not amount to error of law, I would have concluded that the error of logic, alone, is of such magnitude as to constitute error of law. However, Azzopardi precludes that conclusion. Nevertheless, it is plain that the facts have not been ""fully found"", and this is sufficient, in the circumstances, to permit review of the decision. The decision cannot withstand that scrutiny. 

66Counsel for Mr Al-Jubouri sought to defend the decision in other ways, but this does not overcome the fact that there was an error of law infecting the decision. Ground (a) succeeds. 

Ground (b) 

67The Magistrate found, pursuant to s 214(1)(a), that the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner because the OSR failed to go to the property and make enquiries of neighbours. He held that, had the OSR done so: 

""The information [it] would have gleaned from such a visit would have provided [it] with information to suggest that the proceedings should not be brought."" 

Underlying this finding is an assumption that is unwarranted, and not available on the evidence. There was no evidence as to what such enquiries might have yielded. It is equally feasible that the evidence so obtained would have supported the OSR's case. It was not open to the Magistrate to find that failure to make those enquiries was unreasonable. 

68Ground (b) is made out. 

Grounds (c) and (d) 

69Each of these grounds complains that the Magistrate gave no reasons for adverse findings he made concerning the conduct of the OSR. The first ground concerns the conduct of Mr Morse in interviewing Mr Al-Jubouri. There were some exchanges between the Magistrate and counsel when the record of the interview was tendered, and when Mr Morse was questioned about it, but these prompted counsel for the OSR to withdraw the tender. The record was therefore not in evidence. That does not mean, of course, that the Magistrate had no knowledge of the content of the interview, but it ought to have been put out of his mind. More importantly, the finding was made in circumstances where counsel of the OSR had no opportunity to argue about the propriety of the interview, or to make submissions about what conclusion ought to be drawn from it. That, in itself, was an error of law (although one not identified in the grounds). Ground (c) succeeds. 

70I can find no express finding in the terms set out in ground (d), that the conduct of the OSR in commencing and maintaining the prosecution was unreasonable, and, accordingly, it was not an error of law for the Magistrate to fail to give reasons for such a finding. Ground (d) fails. 

71As grounds (a) - (c) are made out, the appeal must succeed. 

72The question then arises: what order ought to be made? 

73The orders I make are: 

(1)the appeal is allowed; 

(2)the order that the OSR pay Mr Al-Jubouri's costs is quashed; 

(3)Mr Al-Jubouri is to pay the costs of the appeal of the OSR. 

74Counsel for Mr Al-Jubouri, against the possibility of such a result, sought a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act 1951. I order that, if otherwise entitled, a certificate be issued to Mr Al-Jubouri.

2708994,MH v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 230,"Judgment 

1CAMPBELL JA: I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of RS Hulme J. I find it unnecessary to express an opinion about the matters dealt with in [36]-[39] and [51]-[53] of his Honour's reasons. 

2I have some reservations about [43]-[44]. Those reservations arise from a sentencing judge sometimes having some advantages over an appellate court, that are not necessarily exhausted by the making of findings of primary facts. In Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531 in the plurality statement of principle at 551, Gibbs ACJ, Jacobs and Murphy JJ said it was ""in general"" - not always - that an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to decide on the proper inference to be drawn from facts which are undisputed or which, having been disputed, are established by the findings of the trial judge. That statement of principle also recognised the need for the appellate court to ""give respect and weight to the conclusion of the trial judge"" . Their Honours went on to say ""but, once having reached its own conclusion, will not shrink from giving effect to it""- but reaching their own conclusion happens only after giving respect and weight to the trial judge. Some of the various areas of a trial judge's advantage are mentioned in Seiwa Australia Pty Ltd v Beard [2009] NSWCA 240 at [150]-[154]. 

3Subject to those remarks, I agree with his Honour's reasons and with the orders he proposes. FILLIN \* MERGEFORMAT 

4RS HULME J: This Applicant for leave to appeal pleaded guilty to 9 charges and was sentenced by Hock DCJ on 14 May 2010. The charges, the section of the Crimes Act constituting the offences, the maximum terms of imprisonment prescribed and, where a standard non-parole period has also been prescribed, that period may be summarised as follows. 

1 Sexual intercourse with a child under 10 - s 66A - 25 years - SNPP 15 years; 
2 Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 - s 66C(2) - 20 years; 
3 Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 - s 66C(2) - 20 years; 
4 Aggravated indecent assault - s 61M(1) - 7 years - SNPP 5 years; 
5 Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 - s 66C(2) - 20 years; 
6 Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 - s 66C(2) - 20 years; 
7 Aggravated sexual assault - s 61J(1) - 20 years - SNPP 10 years; 
8 Aggravated indecent assault - s 61M(1) - 7 years - SNPP 5 years; 
9 Aggravated sexual assault - s 61J(1) - 20 years - SNPP 10 years. 


5The Applicant had been arrested on 9 November 2007. Before he appeared before Hock DCJ he had been sentenced by Woods ADCJ but that sentence was the subject of a successful appeal on grounds that have no present relevance. 

6The complainants were step-daughters of the Applicant who had married their mother in about 1997. The offences, the subject of counts 1 to 6, involved ""J"" and occurred between September 2005 and November 2007 when ""J"" was nearly 10 to just over 12. Those involving ""B"", counts 7 to 9, all occurred between February and May 2007 when she was aged between 15 and 15 and 3 months. The evidence identifying the circumstances of each offence consisted solely of one paragraph in a Statement of Fact. In some cases the paragraph was very brief. There was no criticism of her Honour's account of these circumstances and the following summary is largely taken from her remarks. 

Count 1 
7Shortly before the complainant's 10 th birthday her mother was away for 2 weeks and the children of the household including the complainant were left in the Applicant's care. At some stage he called the complainant to the bathroom, there he removed her pants, rubbed her vagina with his fingers and then inserted his fingers into her anus. 

8Her Honour found that this offence was aggravated by being committed in the complainant's home and in consequence of the Applicant abusing a position of trust vis--vis the complainant. Her Honour characterised the offence as falling in the mid-range of objective seriousness, observing that ""the insertion of fingers (plural) into the complainant's anus when she was nine years old as a matter of commonsense would cause pain to her and is obviously degrading"". The sentence imposed for this offence included a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 11 November 2012 and a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 11 November 2021. 

Count 2 
9When the complainant was aged 10 and at home, the Applicant moved the complainant to a part of the kitchen which was out of sight of other children. He said to her, ""you know that some girls touch themselves"" to which the complainant replied, ""Well, I don't"". He then put his hands down the complainant's pants and placed his fingers into her anus. He lifted her top and started to kiss her breasts. The complainant started to cry and the Applicant told her to ""go and get freshened up"". 

10Her Honour found that this offence was aggravated by being committed in the complainant's home and by the age of the complainant, observing that the younger the child, the more serious the offence. Her Honour imposed a sentence of 8 years imprisonment from 11 November 2008. 


Count 3 
11When the complainant was 11, late one evening the Applicant woke her up, took her to his bedroom and forced her to perform fellatio upon him. 

12Her Honour found the same aggravating circumstances as she had in the case of count 2. She imposed a sentence of 8 years imprisonment from 11 November 2009. 

Count 4 
13After the act described in count 3, the Applicant sucked the complainant's breasts. Her Honour found that this offence was aggravated by the Applicant going to the complainant's bedroom to wake her, that the offence was committed in the complainant's home and that the complainant was only 11 whereas the definition of the offence encompassed children up to 14. Her Honour characterised the offence as falling in the mid-range of objective gravity and imposed a non-parole period of 2 years from 11 November 2007 and a balance of term of 8 months from 11 November 2009. 

Count 5 
14When the complainant was 11 and she, her mother and the Applicant were away from their home but preparing for church, they realised they had left a computer cord at home. The Applicant and the complainant went to obtain the cord. The complainant ran into the house, the Applicant followed and told her to go into his bedroom where she lay on the bed. He told her to kneel on the ground and placed his penis in her mouth and would seem to have ejaculated while it was there. 

15Her Honour found the same aggravating circumstances as she had in the case of count 2. She imposed a sentence of 8 years imprisonment from 11 November 2010. 

Count 6 
16Some months after the offence in count 5, the complainant and the Applicant went to a church store to get some supplies. After they entered, the Applicant took the complainant to the rear where they could not be seen and made her perform fellatio. The complainant was told to put her hand under the Applicant's penis to catch his ejaculate. 

17Her Honour found that this offence was aggravated by the age of the child, 11 or 12. She imposed a sentence of 8 years imprisonment from 11 November 2011. 

Count 7 
18On an occasion when ""B"" had taken the day off school and her mother and siblings were away, the Applicant approached ""B"" while she was in the dining room, pushed her onto the table and placed his penis in her vagina. He ejaculated on her and told her to have a shower. 

19Her Honour found that this offence was aggravated by reason of the complainant being under 16 and also by reason of her being under the Applicant's authority. Her Honour added that she had taken into account that the offence was committed in the complainant's home and noted that the offence occurred whilst the complainant was absent from school due to illness. Her Honour characterised the offence as falling in the mid-range of objective gravity noting that both counsel had so submitted. She imposed a sentence including a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 11 November 2015 and a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 2021. 

Count 8 
20""B"" attended a church store with the Applicant. While there she entered a cubicle at the rear to go to the toilet. The Applicant unlocked the door and entered the cubicle. He lifted her shirt and touched her on the breast. ""B"" ran from the toilet with the Applicant squeezing her arms and breasts causing pain. 

21Her Honour found that this offence was aggravated by reason of the complainant being under 16 and also by reason of her being under the Applicant's authority. She characterised the offence as falling below the mid-range of objective seriousness but not significantly so and imposed a sentence including a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 11 November 2016 and a balance of term of 4 months commencing on 11 November 2017. 

Count 9 
22On an evening when her mother was away the Applicant entered ""B's"" bedroom, woke her up, put his penis into her vagina and had intercourse. He then ejaculated on her and told her to go and have a shower. 

23Her Honour found the same aggravating circumstances as she had in the case of count 7 though also observing that the Applicant had entered the complainant's bedroom while she was asleep and woken her to satisfy his own sexual urges. Again noting that both counsel had so submitted, her Honour characterised the offence as falling in the mid-range of objective gravity. She imposed a sentence including a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 11 November 2019 and a balance of term of 5 years commencing on 2022. This sentence reflected a finding of special circumstances based on the accumulation of sentences. 

24Disregarding for the moment their concurrency, the total of the non-parole periods imposed by her Honour was 53 years. The effective sentence imposed was of 20 years including a non-parole period of 15 years. 

25In arriving at the sentences imposed her Honour noted that the Applicant had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and that she had allowed a discount of 25% on that account. She recorded that she had not set a non-parole period for the offences where a standard non-parole period had not been prescribed as there was no point in doing so. 

26At the time of sentence the Applicant was aged 43. He had a criminal record but his last conviction was in 1986 and her Honour recorded that the gap of 20 years entitled him to some leniency, albeit recognising that good character has less weight in matters of child sexual assault. She also recorded that the Applicant had suffered from depression since age 15, had been on and off medication since then and that he suffered from medical conditions including degeneration of vertebrae causing reduction in the use of the left arm and hand that were likely to make his time in custody more onerous. She recorded that the Applicant was then on limited association and observed that the Applicant might well remain on protection for much of his sentence. She said that she took into account evidence he had given as to his then conditions of incarceration and the likelihood that those conditions might well continue for at least some part of his sentence. 

27The evidence that the Applicant had given as to the conditions of his incarceration was that he was in conditions of limited association, confined to his cell for 22 hours a day, allowed into a courtyard of the same size for the remaining 2 hours and that there was no work, no education and no counselling in these circumstances. 

28Her Honour also observed that the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation appeared to be reasonable. She said that she had decided not to impose the standard non-parole period for any of the offences because of the Applicant's early plea, his past and likely future conditions of incarceration, his expressions of remorse and prospects of rehabilitation. 

29As ultimately pursued, the grounds of appeal were:- 

(i) Her Honour failed to consider the principle of totality in the sentences she imposed upon the Applicant; 
(ii) The aggregate sentence and non-parole period imposed were manifestly excessive; 
(iii) Her Honour erred in her approach to and characterization of the offences subject to the standard non-parole period(s); 
(iv) Her Honour erred in finding that the offences were aggravated by being committed in the complainants' home. 

30The third of these was the subject of a grant of leave during the hearing of the appeal. In subsequent written submissions application was made to add the fourth ground, an application that the Crown did not oppose and which, for reasons that will appear, the Court should grant. 

31Given the terms of the grounds, it will be convenient to consider them out of the order in which they were raised. 

Ground 1 
Her Honour failed to consider the principle of totality in the sentences she imposed upon the Applicant; 

32Although her Honour did not in terms refer to the principle of totality in her remarks, she is so experienced a judge that one would not readily conclude that she overlooked the principle. In fact the degree of concurrency in the sentences imposed and the reduction from the aggregate of 53 years to which I have referred to 15 years is only explicable upon the basis that her Honour did apply the principle. 

33There is no substance in this ground. It fails. 

Ground 4 
Her Honour erred in finding that the offences were aggravated by being committed in the complainants' home. 

34The Crown conceded this ground of appeal but submitted that her Honour's error had no significant influence on the sentence imposed. The concession was rightly made. Although Section 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides as one of the aggravating factors to be taken into account of sentence that ""the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person"", it is established that the provision does not operate to aggravate and offence committed by someone who is lawfully in the home at the time - Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [111] and the cases there cited. 

35However, the frequency with which her Honour mentioned as an aggravating feature the fact that an offence was committed in the complainant's home makes it impossible to accept that the error had no effect on the sentences for offences where her Honour found the feature to exist. Thus, even if for no other reason, this Court is required to consider de novo the sentences her Honour imposed in respect of all counts other than counts 6 and 8. 

Ground 3 
Her Honour erred in her approach to and characterization of the offences subject to the standard non-parole period(s); 

36In the course of its supplementary submissions, the Crown drew attention to some statements in prior decisions of this Court that I have difficulty in accepting. One was of Tobias JA in R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA20; (2009) 194 A Crim R 1 at [21] that:- 

In my respectful view the time has come for this court to depart from any prima facie assumption, let alone general proposition, that digital sexual intercourse is to be regarded as generally less serious than penile sexual intercourse. 

37The matter was not argued. Nor was the Court provided with anything like a comprehensive review of prior authorities, and there are a number. Accordingly, this is not the occasion to attempt a detailed review of the topic. However, as a judgment on a matter of fact, my view is that digital sexual intercourse is generally less serious than penile, particularly penile vaginal, intercourse. Inherently penile vaginal intercourse carries risks or greater risks of venereal disease and pregnancy compared with digital vaginal intercourse. To my mind, and I venture to say in the view of most of the community, penile vaginal intercourse is also a greater affront both physically and mentally to an unwilling victim in consequence of the greater subjugation of her body and intrusion of privacy that such intercourse generally involves. 

38Other forms of forced penile intercourse have their own attributes and incidents, often closely associated with other circumstances of the assault and the relativity might not be so clear. Nevertheless, in these cases also I would generally regard penile intercourse as more serious than digital. 

39In saying what I have in the two immediately preceding paragraphs, I do not, of course, purport to lay down any proposition of law. Nor do I mean to suggest that all cases of penile intercourse are worse than all cases of digital intercourse. Merely do I wish to ensure that Tobias JA's remarks do not pass without dissent and to indicate my views on a topic that does arise in this case, albeit a topic subsidiary to ""the evaluation of circumstances of the offence(s) in their entirety"" - see Baumer v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57; Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 452. 

40A second statement on which the Crown relied was that of Price J, with whom Hodgson JA and Fullerton J agreed, in R v Daley [2010] NSWCCA 223. At [48] his Honour remarked:- 

In R v Hibberd (2009) 194 A Crim R 1 I said at [56] that the duration of the offence was a relevant consideration in the assessment of the seriousness of an offence contrary to s 61I Crimes Act. I wish to make it clear that the short duration of a sexual assault would not ordinarily be considered as a factor which reduces the objective seriousness of the offence. Most sexual assaults will not be prolonged as the offender will seek to avoid apprehension. On the other hand, a sexual assault of an extended duration will necessarily add to the seriousness of the offending as the suffering and the humiliation of the victim will be increased. 

41I agree with his Honour that a continuation of an offence for a longer period will tend to add to the seriousness of the offending. I also agree that an offence involving intercourse is committed however short that intercourse may be. However if his Honour intended to suggest that the shortness of the intercourse is not a factor that argues for a lesser rather than a greater penalty, I disagree. One situation is but the converse of the other and if a longer period tends to add to the seriousness of offending, it follows as the night the day that a shorter period argues for regarding the offending as less serious than it would have been if continued for longer. 

42The recent decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [60] confirms that the circumstance that an offence is of short duration is a relevant factor. 

43A third was the statement of Spigelman CJ in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]:- 

Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. 

44These remarks have been accepted in many cases since. However, I confess to having difficulty in accepting them. Once the relevant primary facts are found, this Court is in just as good a position as a sentencing judge to make a judgment as to where, on a scale of objective seriousness, an offence falls. It does not seem to me that the circumstances are relevantly any different from those considered in Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531 in connection with findings of negligence. See also the discussion by Campbell JA in R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 at [73] et seq. 

45This also was a matter that was not argued. In any event, it is unnecessary to decide it. In the case of the sentences imposed for all counts other than counts 6 and 8, Hock DCJ's assessment as to objective gravity was affected by her Honour's error in regarding as aggravating the fact that the offences were committed in the complainants' home. Offences 6 and 8, of course, did not occur in the complainants' home. 

46I should perhaps add that I do not see in her Honour's approach to the topic of objective seriousness any other factor adverse to the interest of the Applicant and which the recent decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 held to be erroneous. 

Ground 2 
The aggregate sentence and non-parole period imposed were manifestly excessive 

47Because of the errors to which reference has already been made, it is strictly unnecessary for the Court to consider whether the sentences on counts 1-5, 7 and 9 were manifestly excessive. Technically the issue that arises on each of those 7 counts is whether, in the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ""some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed"" and, if so, what that sentence should be. Of course, in examining that issue, questions of manifest excess may incidentally arise. In the circumstances, it will be convenient to consider the 9 sentences seriatim. In the course of that exercise, it will be appropriate to reflect also on some of her Honour's comments. 

48Before turning to those individual sentences, it is however appropriate to note one passage in her Honour's remarks that is affected by error. Her Honour said:- 

In summary over a period of two years the offender subjected these two children to these acts of sexual abuse. The one Victim Impact Statement tendered sets out the severe effect that his conduct had on the older victim. I find the emotional harm caused to her was substantial. In respect of both children it is likely that they will suffer long term psychological and emotional harm. 

49In fact the Victim Impact Statement was by ""J"". Furthermore, while the period of offending encompassed by the charge was from September 2005 to November 2007, and whatever suspicions one may have, the period covered by the charges involving ""B"" was only 3 months. 

50Three further matters should be the subject of remark. Firstly, I have sought to approach the task of determining what sentences should be, or should have been imposed in accordance with the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen. 

51Secondly, while I must do as best I can, I find it virtually impossible to give proper weight to both the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole periods enacted by Parliament for the offences the subject of counts 1, 4, 7, 8 and 9. 

52As has been said, the maximum penalty for offences 4 and 8 is 7 years and the standard non-parole period is 5 years. In accordance with long standing sentencing practice the maximum penalty is reserved for cases falling within a ""worst"" case category - see Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451; Veen v The Queen (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478. It is also a longstanding sentencing practice to fix a non-parole period except in rare cases at no more than 75% of the total sentence imposed. 75% of 7 years is 5 years, only 3 months more than the period Parliament has said should be imposed for a sentence in the ""middle of the range of objective seriousness"". I have previously described the relativity between the two provisions as ""absurd"", a description from which I do not resile. 

53The inconsistency is not quite as bad in the case of offence 1 where the maximum penalty is 25 years and the standard non-parole period 15 years or offences 7 and 9 where the maximum penalty is 20 years and the standard non-parole periods 10 years, particularly when one bears in mind that the severity of sentences is not simply proportional to length but increases disproportionately as the length increases. Nevertheless, the inconsistency still exists. Thus for a ""worst"" case of an offence under s 66A one could expect a non-parole period of 18 years, not much more than the standard non-parole period of 15 years for an offence in the ""middle of the range of objective seriousness"". 

54Thirdly, in Smith v R [2011] NSWCCA 163 I had occasion to consider a number of offences similar to some of those here and in the course of doing so to research and refer to the Judicial Commission statistics and a number of prior decisions. Where relevant, I have relied on the information to be gleaned from the Smith judgment but it is not necessary that I repeat all of that information here. Of course, there are differences between the two cases and I have sought to ensure that I have made appropriate allowances in that regard. The major differences lie, firstly, in the fact that at the time of most of the offences committed by Mr Smith, he was not in a position of trust and even for the offences where he was, his position was somewhat different from the Applicant's and, secondly, that Mr Smith received no discount for pleading guilty. 

Count 1 
55The paragraph of the Statement of Facts dealing with this count contained no indication of how long the offence lasted, whether such of the Applicant's fingers as were inserted were inserted as a group or whether the complainant suffered injury or pain. Notwithstanding that the onus of showing matters adverse to the Applicant's interests was on the Crown, no issue was taken with her Honour's findings and the Court should accordingly proceed on the basis of them. Nevertheless, the situation remains that there is no evidence that the intercourse took more a period to be measured in seconds. 

56Applied to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, the 25% discount allowed by her Honour would result in periods of 18 and 11 years respectively. When compared with these figures, the sentence imposed by her Honour of 12 years including a non-parole period of 9 years is very high. Notwithstanding the abuse by the Applicant of his position of trust, the absence of any evidence that the offence was prolonged or caused any physical injury and the fact that the penetration was digital, leads to the view that the offence was far removed from both a worst case and one in the mid-point of objective seriousness. In these circumstances the sentence was not only affected by her Honour's error in regarding its occurrence in the complainant's home as an aggravating factor but it was also manifestly excessive. 

Count 2 
57This offence was not much different from the first offence although it would seem to have had a more serious impact on the complainant at the time than did the first offence and was committed in the face of an indication of distaste on her part. The complainant was older and the maximum sentence provided for is 20 years rather than 25. 

58Applied to the maximum penalty of 20 years, the 25% discount allowed by her Honour would result in a maximum sentence of 15 years. Applying the common ratio of 3 to 1, the non-parole portion of such a sentence would be 11 years. Hock DCJ's sentence of 8 years (fixed term) is again very heavy and in my view manifestly excessive. Far, far worse cases of offences under the section can be envisaged. 

Count 3 
59The remarks I have made when considering count 2 as to the relativity of the maximum sentence prescribed and the sentence imposed, apply to this count also. On the other hand, and putting aside such possible accompanying features as pain, duration, threats and additional violence, I regard forced fellatio imposed on a girl of 11 as in its inherent nature significantly worse than digital penetration of her anus. That said, I am of the view that this sentence also is manifestly excessive. 

Count 4 
60The sentence of 2 years and 8 months is more than one third of the maximum 7 years penalty for this offence. If one reduced that maximum to take account of the guilty plea, one would arrive at a figure of 5 years. Conversely, if one grossed up the 2 years 8 months by the discount, one would arrive at a figure of just over 3 years and 6 months, more than half the maximum penalty. A similar comparison between the 2 years non-parole period imposed and the standard non-parole period of 5 years leads to a similar conclusion. 

61The offence was the sucking of the complainant's breasts for an unknown period. When one has regard to the comparisons made in the immediately preceding paragraph, the far more serious conduct that can amount to an offence under the section and notwithstanding the abuse of trust involved, I am unable to regard the sentence imposed for count 4 as within the legitimate exercise of Hock DCJ's sentencing discretion. 

Count 5 
Like count 3, this count related to an offence of fellatio and some of the remarks made when considering count 3 have application here also. However, the offence was made significantly worse than it otherwise would have been by the Applicant ejaculating in the complainant's mouth. That said, the sentence of 8 years (fixed term) is still too close to the 20 years maximum, discounted for the Applicant's plea and further reduced to reflect an appropriate non-parole period to have been within the legitimate exercise of her Honour's discretion. I regard this offence as similar in gravity to those the subject of counts 7 and 9. 

Count 6 
62I would regard the seriousness of this offence as falling somewhere between offences 3 and 5. By parity of reasoning, again the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 

Counts 7 and 9 
63Constituted by penile-vaginal intercourse and ejaculation, albeit after withdrawal, these offences (and that the subject of count 5) were the most serious of those committed by the Applicant. The sentences imposed were influenced by her Honour's erroneous approach to there having been committed in the complainant's home but I am not persuaded that, within the terms of s 6(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , a ""sentence ... less severe is warranted in law and should have been imposed"". 

64That last remark is subject to two qualifications. It may be necessary to vary the commencement date of the sentences to reflect the success the challenges to other sentences and in the case of the sentence imposed for count 9 it may also be appropriate to vary the relativity of the non-parole and balance of term, depending on the view taken as to the appropriate total effective sentence. 

Count 8 
65Remarks made whilst considering count 3 have some application here. On the other hand, the additional disregard of the complainant's privacy and persistence in the face of her seeking to end the assault makes this offence worse than it otherwise would have been. I am unpersuaded that there was any error affecting this sentence adversely to the Applicant and in any event, I do not regard it as one where some lesser sentence should have been imposed. Again it may be appropriate to vary the commencement date. 

66In light of the above, including Hock DCJ's remarks concerning the Applicant's subjective circumstances, and subject to possible variation in the case of the last sentence to be served, the non-parole or fixed terms that the Applicant should serve are as follows:- 

(i) (digital/anal intercourse) 3 years 
(ii) (digital/anal intercourse) 3 years 
(iii) (fellatio) 5 years 
(iv) (sucking of breasts) 1 year 
(v) (fellatio including ejaculation) 6 years 
(vi) (fellatio including ejaculation) 5 years 
(vii) (penile/vaginal intercourse) 6 years 
(viii) (touching of breasts with persistence) 1 year 
(ix) (penile/vaginal intercourse) 6 years 

67(Simply as a matter of convenient reference, in the above table I have abbreviated the description of each offence.) 

68In the case of the offences the subject of standard non-parole periods, s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires that a non-parole be set. In the case of the other offences it is more convenient to set a fixed term. 

69The total of the above periods is 36 years. Obviously the principle of totality requires that the sentences not simply be aggregated and the question that then arises is what should be the total effective sentence. Given the extent of the reduction compared with the sentences imposed by Hock DCJ, there should be some reduction in the effective sentence. On the other hand, one must recognise that there were two victims who suffered at the Applicant's hands and each offence increased his criminality. A number of the offences individually merited non-parole periods or fixed terms of, or approximating, 6 years. 

70In my view, an appropriate total sentence is one of 12 years in custody and an additional term of 3 years. I appreciate that the effect of such a sentence is that the balance of term is 20% of the total sentence rather than the more usual 25% but, given her Honour's findings as to the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, I am not persuaded that he needs longer on conditional liberty. Furthermore, his criminality was such that the 12 years I propose should not be reduced. Because of the accumulation of sentences I would find special circumstances and adjust the sentence last to be served so that it contains a balance of term of 3 years. 

71One further matter should be mentioned. Hock DCJ and, according to the Department of Corrective Services' custodial record for the Applicant, Woods ADCJ before her, fixed the Applicant's sentences to start on 11 November 2007. However the Applicant gave evidence that he was arrested on 9 November 2007. The Particulars of Trial provided to this Court confirm that date and that the Applicant has been in custody ever since. The custodial record shows that the Applicant went into the custody of the Corrective Services Department on 10 November 2007, a fact that is not obviously inconsistent with him having been arrested the previous day. There is nothing in the material before this Court to explain the choices of 11 November 2007 and in the circumstances it is appropriate to fix 9 November 2007 as the date from which the first of the Applicant's sentences should commence. 

72To give effect to these conclusions at which I have arrived, I propose the following orders:- 

1. Grant leave to appeal; 

2. Grant leave to the Applicant to amend the Notice of Appeal by adding the ground I have numbered (iv); 

3. Allow the appeal; 

4. Quash the sentences imposed by Hock DCJ on the Applicant on 14 May 2010; 

5. In lieu thereof sentence the Applicant as follows:- 

(i) In the case of count 4, to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year commencing on 9 November 2007, together with a further term of 4 months commencing on 9 November 2008; 

(ii) In the case of count 8, to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year commencing on 9 May 2008, together with a further term of 4 months commencing on 9 May 2009; 

(iii) In the case of count 1, to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 9 November 2008, together with a further term of 1 year commencing on 9 November 2011; 

(iv) In the case of count 2, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years commencing on 9 November 2009; 

(v) In the case of count 3, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 5 years commencing on 9 November 2010, 

(vi) In the case of count 5, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 years commencing on 9 November 2011; 

(vii) In the case of count 6, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 5 years and 6 months commencing on 9 November 2012; 

(viii) In the case of count 7, to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 9 November 2013, together with a further term of 2 year commencing on 9 November 2019; 

(ix) In the case of count 9, to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 9 November 2014, together with a further term of 3 years commencing on 9 November 2019. 

73Record as the earliest date upon which it appears to the Court that the Applicant will be eligible for parole, 9 November 2019. 

74HOEBEN J : I agree with the judgment of RS Hulme J and the orders which he proposes. 

75In relation to paragraphs [43]-[44], that matter was not fully argued. Accordingly, I express no opinion in respect thereof.

		02 May 2012",2011-10-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709006,R v Luke John SPAROS [2011] NSWDC 187,"SENTENCE 

Introduction

1Operation Schoale, an investigation by a joint task force of the New South Wales Crime Commission and New South Wales Police, has led to the arrest of a number of people involved in the importation and supply of cocaine and associated crimes involving dealing in large sums of money the proceeds of crime and, in some cases, firearm offences. 

2Luke John Sparos, the offender now before the Court, has pleaded guilty to two offences arising from Operation Schoale. Count 1, an offence against the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), involves importing a commercial quantity of border controlled drugs, being cocaine, between 26 October 2006 and 25 December 2006. The quantity imported was more than the commercial quantity, contrary to s 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 

3The second count is an offence pursuant to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), that on about 20 December 2006 he, at Sydney, did supply a large commercial quantity of cocaine, being an amount that was not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. That offence also carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 

4The offender's role in the importation matter, in particular, is described in the Agreed Facts as ""subordinate only to Alen Moradian"" who was a middle level manager. Alen Moradian was sentenced by me to a lengthy term of imprisonment for offences of a similar nature to those now before the Court: Moradian [2011] NSWDC 130. 

5Each offence is so serious that only a lengthy gaol term could be imposed. The offender was initially charged with a proceeds of crime offence on 28 February 2007 and released to bail. I have determined the offender has been in custody since his arrest on the substantive charges since 25 July 2007.  Although there have been submissions to the contrary, it is my intention that his sentence shall commence from that date. The proceeds of crime matter for which he was originally arrested has now expanded and I have been asked to, and do, take into account when I sentence him for the State offence, an offence pursuant to 193B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime in the sum of $2,452,155. 

The guilty pleas 

6The guilty pleas were entered in this Court on 1 August 2011. The offender was committed for trial on 28 July 2010. He was arraigned on 26 November 2010 and entered a plea of not guilty. His trial was listed for hearing on 14 April 2011. That date was vacated and it was fixed to commence on 1 August of this year, the date he entered his plea. 

7The negotiations in relation to this matter between the Crown and the defence are, and were, extensive. They are set out in the Agreed Facts and the affidavit of Mr Hudson, which is part of Exhibit 1. It is clear that there had been some attempts to resolve issues relating to the plea in mid-2010. I note that Mr Moradian was sentenced on 13 July 2011 and on that date I determined a factual dispute about the amount of pure cocaine imported. 

8In all the circumstances, it is clear that there is some utilitarian value in the pleas for the State offence and the Commonwealth offence. It is also clear that for the Commonwealth offence there is considerable facilitation of the course of justice. I will have more to say about this matter as I proceed to sentence. So far as the State matter is concerned it would be, in my opinion, appropriate to allow a reduction of the otherwise appropriate sentence of 12.5 per cent. While one is not always encouraged to give percentages in Commonwealth matters, it is my intention, for the reasons I will set out in my remarks, to allow a reduction in the otherwise appropriate penalty of something in the vicinity of fifteen percent. 

Two serious offences 

9Both the Commonwealth and State offences carry maximum penalties of, as I have said, life imprisonment. It is important to note that the maximum penalty for the Commonwealth offence becomes operative when amounts of more than two kilograms of cocaine are imported. So far as the State offence is concerned, the large commercial quantity figure cuts in at one kilogram. The State offence also carries with it a standard non-parole period of fifteen years. Those maximum penalties and the standard non-parole period, where applicable, act as guides to the exercise of my sentencing discretion. They indicate the seriousness with which Parliaments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales regard offences of the type now before me. 

10When I formulate my sentence for the State offence I will also take into account the matter on the Form 1 by giving greater weight to considerations of personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to exact retribution for what was, in itself, serious offending. 

11As will be clear from my findings, the supply offence does not fall within the middle of the range for objective seriousness for offences of its type. It would, in my opinion, fall at the very bottom of the range. This provides one reason for departure from the standard non-parole period, as does the plea, the subjective case, a finding of special circumstances that I will make, the need to take note of the other sentence to be imposed for the Commonwealth offence and the principles of totality. 

12Every offender and every offence is, in a way, individual. Here, the sentence must be based on the Agreed Facts and the matter specific to the offender. Others apprehended following Operation Schoale have been sentenced by me. However, the facts in each case differ from the others. For example, the Agreed Facts here speak of two co-offenders being involved in the supply of firearms. Those co-offenders were not sentenced for offences of that particular type. Here, the offender faces the same two principal offences as the man, Moradian, but again the Agreed Facts differ from those agreed or proved against him. There is no rule of law that co-offenders be given the same sentence for the same offence. All things are rarely equal. Nevertheless, those other sentences act as a guide to the exercise of my sentencing discretion here. I take them into account. I have endeavoured to maintain due proportion between them. I note in particular the sentences imposed in Moradian [2011] NSWDC 130; Arja [2011] NSWDC 131; Johnson [2010] NSWDC 242, Peisley [2010] NSWDC 240 and Saliba [2010] NSWDC 277 (the offender's wife). 

13I also note what occurred during the sentencing of two other men, Mato and Rusu by Judge Frearson (unreported, NSWDC 3 September 2010). Although no question of direct parity arises, there is a need to consider proportionality with this sentence. Those matters, however, involved multiple importations totalling over 200 kilograms of cocaine and those two offenders went to trial. Judge Frearson, there, characterised their roles as principals in the conspiracy. Here, there was a relatively sophisticated single importation using the same methods as those used by Mato and Rusu but there was a plea of guilty, a measure of co-operation and the Crown have agreed that the offender's role was subordinate to a person described as ""a middle manager"". 

14So far as is relevant, I must also have regard to the pattern of sentencing for like offences. The Court of Criminal Appeal has recently set out the relevant principles for assessing objective seriousness of importation offences and referred to a number of cases to assist judges in the exercise of their sentencing discretion. I note Nguyen and Pham (2010) 205 A Crim R 106, De La Rosa (2010) 205 A Crim R 1 and Holland (2011) 205 A Crim R 429. The summaries in De La Rosa are very helpful but I must look to the facts as agreed here rather than simply make an attempt to compartmentalise this offender's crimes. 

15I must sentence the offender for two offences. The purposes of sentencing, although one is a Commonwealth offence and one is a State offence, apply equally to both offences. It would be wrong to punish the offender twice for any elements and matters that are common to both. I must, however, fix an appropriate sentence and non-parole period for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as, of course, the question of totality. Factors relevant to the fixing of the term of the sentence are the same as those for the fixing of the non-parole period but the weight given to them may differ. The individual and total non-parole periods must reflect the minimum time period in all the circumstances of the offences this offender must spend in custody before being eligible for release. The total non-parole period must also maintain the benefits given in each sentence for the guilty pleas. 

16In determining what sentence is to be imposed I must have regard to what is set out in s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and ss 3A and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 

17Significant weight must also be given in the importation matter to principles relating to general deterrence, although that term is not used in s 16A. The principles in both Acts and the general common law recognise that, given the difficulty of detecting offences such as these and the great social consequences that are attendant on the illicit drug trade, the Court is compelled to attempt to neutralise the potential rewards by the risk of certain and severe punishment. 

18As indicated, the supply shared a number of critical elements with the importation as the same cocaine was involved. The significant overlap in the criminality involved means most of the objects of sentencing apply equally to this offence and the importation. Given the way I will structure the sentence the supply offence's non-parole period has been subsumed by the non-parole period for the Commonwealth offence. I am, however, obliged to fix separate sentences for each offence and consider relevant New South Wales sentencing principles when fixing the sentence for the supply offence. 

19I now turn to an assessment of the offences' objective seriousness. This requires an examination of the Agreed Facts. Those facts reveal that Mr T, who worked for an international freight business and whose identity cannot be revealed, had assisted Mato and Rusu with their importations of cocaine. The offender, together with his co-offender Alen Moradian, employed a private investigator to find Mr T. In October 2006 they paid Mr T a visit at his home. The visit so concerned Mr T's wife that she called the police. The two men left before the police arrived leaving $500,000 with Mr T as ""a gesture of goodwill"". Further meetings took place during which an illicit business proposition was put whereby Mr T would facilitate the importation of cocaine by providing relevant forged documents and the services of the company he worked for. The offender met with Mr T on a number of occasions with the offender, Moradian, and another co-offender, Mr Johnson. A further $1 million was paid to Mr T. A foreign exchange dealer was used by the offender and Moradian to change another $1AUD million to US dollars. This sum was involved in part-payment of the cocaine to be imported. 

20Associates of Mr Moradian sourced the cocaine in the US. It was secreted in one kilogram blocks and packaged and sent via Mr T's company to Australia. In December 2006 the package arrived as a shipment labelled ""Concrete Blades"". It followed the same procedure adopted by Mr T, Mato and Rusu with their conspiracy. After the package had cleared customs Mr T took it to Homebush. Moradian met him there and directed him to a townhouse at Newington. There the package was unpacked. Although the townhouse was occupied by another co-offender, John Youkhana, this offender, as the Agreed Facts reveal, had an association with the premises. 

21In the Moradian matter I examined the evidence relating to the amount of cocaine imported. It is agreed in these proceedings that the importation yielded a pure weight of cocaine of between forty to sixty kilograms, based on a purity of sixty-one per cent. It is important to note again the commercial quantity of cocaine required to found a s 307.1 charge and the maximum penalty of life imprisonment is two kilograms. 

22As to the offender's role, the Agreed Facts note, so far as the s 307.1 charge is concerned, and I quote from those facts: 

""The offender was subordinate only to Moradian who was a middle level manager. The offender's role and participation was significant to give effect to the importation. His conduct encompassed the following: engagement of the services of the private investigator to identify and locate Mr T; participation in the initial meetings where Mr T was recruited to take part in the importation for them in preference to Mato and Rusu. Those meetings included the meeting on 27 October 2006, the meeting at the Chinese restaurant at Fox Studios and the continuation of that meeting at Johnson's premises. The offender did not take part in any subsequent discussions between Moradian and Mr T where the furtherance of the importation was discussed, including arrangements such as the weight of the importation and payment of money to Mr T for his services. The offender was associated with various rental properties used by the organisation in relation to the importation, receipt and unpacking of the cocaine partially in the presence of Mr T and the presence of Moradian; the organisation of the finances, including the facilitation of exchange of large amounts of Australian currency into United States currency to fund the importation; the collection of some of the proceeds derived from the importation"". 

23He is to be sentenced on that basis. 

24Here, a very high commercial quantity of the drug with a correspondingly high street value was imported. The offender played a senior role in an enterprise that was well planned and of some sophistication. His role was important to its success. He took a degree of risk with an expectation of large reward. His motivation was personal profit and greed. 

25I am anxious not to apportion a single label to this offender. The matters just discussed reveal he did very important things to facilitate the importation. Some of the things he did were critical to that importation. He expected, and received, a substantial reward. He wanted the lifestyle; the underworld prestige. His words from his letter to me are that he was caught up in the hype. He wanted the money and he wanted the goods that are associated with such large sums of money. It would appear that he wanted to play, and did play, the role of a major drug dealer. I find his motives were purely selfish and for greed. He took risks but, as he now says, he belatedly realises greater risks are taken by those who used the product he imported. 

26As to the supply offence, the Agreed Facts reveal that one kilogram of cocaine mixture was sold by the offender and Moradian to Mr T on 20 December 2006 for $AUD90,000, about half the usual price. This is the only supply charged against the offender. Following any large illicit drug importation there is an expectation the drug imported will be supplied. Here, the actual supply charged appears to relate to a spontaneous gesture to a fellow offender. While clearly sold by both men to Mr T for profit, it was at a reduced rate and appears to me more as a gesture of goodwill. There is no evidence that the offender, unlike Moradian, chose to increase his profit or extend his criminal activity by acting as a wholesaler of the drug he had imported. 

27I note that for offences pursuant to s 25(2) and the punishment provision in s 33 the large commercial quantity of cocaine which would attract the maximum penalty of life imprisonment is one kilogram. While a very serious offence in itself, that fact, and the other matters relating to the supply to Mr T, place this matter at the very bottom of the range for offences of its type. 

28As it occurred as an incident of the importation a considerable degree of concurrency of sentences is required. When I consider the question of concurrence I take into account the compounding effects of long sentences. When I consider the sentences as a whole, and individually, I take into account those compounding effects: severity is not simply a product of length of sentence, severity increases at a greater rate the longer the sentence. 

The Form 1 

29While I must focus on the sentence for the primary offence, a Form 1 can and, as I have indicated, does lead to an increase in the sentence that would otherwise be imposed for the principal offence. Sometimes that increase can be considerable. Here, the offender asks that I take into account that he knowingly dealt with the proceeds of crime in the sum of close to two and a half million dollars. 

30The immense sums able to be taken from users by drug traders are clearly illustrated in this case. The trade in drugs causes immense harm to the community and to individuals. Black money in the community also undermines the community's economic well-being. To willingly participate in the process, knowing what he was doing and knowing the source of the money was illicit, makes this particular matter on a Form 1, when one considers the sum involved, a very serious crime indeed. 

31Some of the money involved was clearly and intimately involved with the importation, for instance the $500,000 given to Mr T and the $1AUD million changed into US dollars. Other sums involved the movement of the apparent profits of the importation. 

32In February 2007 the offender travelled with Ahmed Arja to Queensland. On 28 February 2007 the offender and Arja were stopped and searched driving from Queensland to Newcastle with $814,000 in cash in the car. I sentenced Mr Arja to a suspended sentence of fifteen months for his role in this crime. I took into account the utilitarian value of his plea, the delay and his strong subjective case. 

33The remainder of the money concerned with the Form 1 relates to luxury motor vehicles consistent with the large sorts of profits that can be made by involving oneself with the importation of illicit drugs. The Form 1 matter requires an increase in the sentence for the principal offence and militates against complete concurrence of that offence with that to be imposed for the Commonwealth matters. 

Other matters 

34The offender has a criminal history. He is not to be punished for that and it does not disentitle him totally to leniency. He came before the Children's Court for a serious assault offence. At nineteen he was acting as a distributor for a fairly major cannabis dealer. A Crown appeal saw a suspended sentence converted, by the Court of Criminal Appeal, to one year's imprisonment. At the time he was sentenced in the District Court he was, and presented as, a person with good prospects for rehabilitation but the Court of Criminal Appeal held that his circumstances were not so sufficiently exceptional as to justify a non-custodial sentence. 

35That is, as I understand it, the law as it was at the time but my experience, confirmed by a recent study of the Victorian Sentencing Council, indicates for young offenders first custodial sentences carry real risks and not the expected deterrent effect. Gaol can provide a learning environment. It does not always encourage pro-social attitudes, rather you meet new peers and they can provide negative role models. Gaol can stigmatise a person and is rarely effective in addressing the underlying causes of criminal behaviour. 

36The offender was sentenced by Judge Norrish QC for an offence which was committed on 19 April 2007. He had been in custody for some time when those sentencing proceedings took place. He received a short custodial sentence but it is important to note that his two co-offenders were not sentenced to full-time custody. He was not characterised as the worst of those offenders, although he did have, it appears, a worse record. If I were sentencing this offender for the offence which was before Judge Norrish, I, myself, would have made this offence concurrent. I note that his Honour imposed a full-time sentence because, as a matter of law, a suspended sentence was not available to him. I note this offence for which Judge Norrish sentenced him appears to have been committed while on bail for the offence which makes up part of the Form 1. 

37In all the circumstances and given the length of the sentence I intend to impose, I believe it is appropriate that these sentences be concurrent with those imposed by Judge Norrish and I intend to start these sentences from 25 July 2007. The principle of totality, I believe, also compels that conclusion. 

38There is a gaol history before me and it confirms what the prisoner wrote to me: that he has no discipline matters since he came into custody in 2007. The guilty plea was entered late on the day of trial. Because the principal sentence is a Commonwealth matter I must focus on what was done by this offender to facilitate the course of justice. I have a discretion as to the amount that I can reduce the otherwise appropriate penalty by the exercise of that discretion to take into account that facilitation of the course of justice. Such reductions in penalty are there to encourage pleas of guilty and to encourage assistance with resolving all issues. The reduction is not simply based on the timing of the guilty plea but it is, in many cases, a significant factor which must be taken into account. It is clear to me that this offender had the opportunity of pleading guilty much earlier than he did. 

39So far as the State offence is concerned, while it did have continuing utilitarian value the plea was, as I understand it, totally conditional upon other matters being resolved in relation to the Commonwealth matter. I would, in the exercise of my discretion, reduce the State matter by a figure of 12.5 per cent. I note that there was an offer made by the defence in mid-2010 to plead to the Commonwealth offence, with the amount of drugs involved being identical to those to which he ultimately pleaded in August of this year, and that indicates some willingness to facilitate the course of justice. However, because such an offer was conditional and was held back until the matter came for trial, in the exercise of my discretion I have determined that a reduction in penalty of about fifteen per cent would be appropriate to recognise the facilitation of the course of justice here. 

The offender 

40The case for the offender is set out in the various Exhibits, numbered 1 to 10. There is no sworn evidence from the offender but most of the statements in Exhibit 1 relate to uncontroversial matters and they show some consistency. The offender was born on 12 November 1980. He is nearly thirty-one. These offences occurred when he was twenty-five and twenty-six. I found the report of the psychologist, Ms Player, very helpful. The factual foundation for her conclusions are supported in the other material before me. I detected no hint of exaggeration in her conclusions which were relevant and sound. 

41It appears that the offender was the product of a difficult family background, marred by parental conflict, physical and emotional abuse. This is confirmed by the offender's sister's letter to me. It is also apparent that early anti-social attitudes were ingrained in the home environment. The offender received no real benefit from school and was expelled in Year 9. 

42The background, which is set out in full in the letters to me and Ms Player's report, helps explain why he was tempted by the lifestyle of the drug dealer and by Mr Moradian who he had met at various times prior to his involvement with Moradian and the commission of these offences. They also show that he has some capacity for stable employment and that there are job offers available to him. He has worked in gaol. He is presently a head sweeper. As indicated earlier, there are no adverse prison discipline offences indicated against him. 

43In custody he has suffered from anxiety, depression, pessimism and paranoia. All these responses could be expected from someone in his position, particularly given the considerable delay in bringing this matter to conclusion, the uncertainty attendant on that delay and the violence which is unfortunately still present in our gaol system, despite what I understand are considerable efforts to strike it out. I accept that he was, himself, seriously assaulted while in gaol and, as a consequence, will suffer continuing anxiety. The material before me in his letter is confirmed by information I received in other matters, that on entering gaol he weighed about 120 kilograms. He weighs now about a bit under eighty kilograms. Matters such as anxiety and paranoia could not have but been affected by the serious assault upon him. 

44Because of the delay he has been unable to be classified. This is the unfortunate situation with remand prisoners. He has spent a very, very long time on remand in maximum security. Much of this delay has not been his direct fault. Even those who were arrested pursuant to Operation Schoale and pleaded guilty early were only sentenced by me late last year and this year, and some matters are still outstanding. As he has been in maximum security he has been unable to access all programs and that additional hardship has been taken into account by me in formulating my sentence. 

45Ms Player notes that he remains determined not to re-offend. Those sentiments are expressed in his letter to me and are mirrored in the reports and references before me. 

46The offender has clearly been disturbed by the break-up of his marriage and the fact that a daughter was born while he is in custody. His crimes mean that she has only known her father while he has been in gaol and he has missed the great pleasure a father can enjoy in caring for and seeing a young child grow. 

47Ms Player notes the real need for assistance in coming to grips with his marriage break-up and the need for psychological intervention while he is in custody. She also concludes that that intervention will be necessary when he is released to parole and that his background is such that over-arching supervision by NSW Community Offender Services is a necessity. 

48Mr Sparos, in his letter, speaks of his remorse and this is confirmed by other references. It is clear that he shows some insight into the problems the drug trade has brought, but reading all of those references and his letter brings to my mind more that he is sorry for what he has put himself and his family through and what he has lost rather than the harm he has caused others. 

49Other references do indicate that he is at last growing up and that he is determined to do better and that his plans are sound and, with assistance, his prospects are good. I agree with Ms Player's conclusion: 

""His employment history and future work plans indicate that his job prospects are sound. He does not reveal any substance abuse problems that could complicate his adjustment to community living. As such, a sentence that allows Mr Sparos to maximise his time in the community whilst under supervision and receiving specialist professional supports will provide him with the best opportunity to address his recidivism risk and pursue a pro-social lifestyle in the long term"". 

50Those matters again support my finding of special circumstances in relation to the State offence and what some might regard as a generous non-parole period for the Commonwealth offence. 

51Ultimately, however, it is the nature and circumstances and the objective seriousness of the importation offence that I have to put at the forefront, in particular this offender's role in that offence. When I come to formulate what I trust is an adequate sentence and punishment I have to take into account the seriousness of the offence. I also have to take into account his guilty pleas, his background and the impact of the sentence on him and his family. While I can properly recognise a subjective case put by an offender and the community interest in furthering his rehabilitation, a sentence for matters such as these must be harsh enough to deter him from following this path in the future. It must also, so far as is practical, attempt to deter others by showing simply that to engage in such conduct is not worth it. It must also recognise the harm crimes such as these cause individuals and the community in general and, in particular, it must operate to denounce such conduct. 

Sentence 

52Would you please stand Mr Sparos. In relation to Count 2, taking into account my finding of special circumstances and the matter on the Form 1, you are convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years and four months, consisting of a non-parole period of three years and three months, to commence on 25 July 2007 and expire on 24 October 2010. The balance of the sentence is one year and one month, to commence on 25 October 2010 and expire on 24 November 2011. I would indicate that, but for the plea of guilty, a sentence of five years would have been imposed upon you. 

53In relation to Count 1, the Commonwealth matter, you are convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fourteen years and six months. Your sentence is to commence on 25 January 2008. I fix a non-parole period of eight years and six months, to expire on 24 July 2016 on which date, subject to s 19AL Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), you are to be released to parole. There will be a parole period of six years, to commence on 25 July 2016 and expire on 24 July 2022. 

54I am required to explain that sentence to you. The total sentence for the Commonwealth matter is fourteen years and six months with a non-parole period of 8 years 6 months and a parole period of 6 years. 

55The total effective sentence I have imposed upon you is fifteen years with a non-parole period of nine years and a parole period of six years. If you accord with your practice to date of good behaviour in gaol you can expect to be released to parole on 24 July 2016. 

56The s 166 matters shall be withdrawn and dismissed.

		10 January 2012",2011-10-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709019,State of NSW v Roy De La Torre [2011] NSWSC 1263,"Judgment 

1Roy De La Torre, who is now 53 years old, has spent nearly 20 years in jail for sexual offences committed against young girls aged between five and 11 years old. 

2In accordance with the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (SSO Act), Mr De La Torre is a sex offender who has committed more than one serious sex offence. 

3On 21 December 2010, Mr De La Torre was released from prison on parole. Since that time he has lived at the Nunyara Facility, which is part of the Community Offender Support Program (COSP). 

4On 29 July 2011, the State of NSW filed an application in this Court by a summons, for interim and final orders, pursuant to the SSO Act, for an extended supervision order with respect to Mr De La Torre. The State also sought certain orders which would facilitate an ultimate hearing and determination. 

5On 25 August 2011, Adams J made orders, which were consented to by Mr De La Torre, that he be the subject of an interim supervision order pursuant to s 8(1) of the SSO Act for a period up to 4pm on 23 October 2011. His Honour also made orders, which were again consented to, pursuant to s 7(4) of the SSO Act, for Dr Andrew Ellis and Dr Anthony Samuels, expert psychiatrists, to undertake examinations of Mr De La Torre and provide those reports to the Court. 

6A final hearing of the proceedings was fixed for 19 October 2011. 

7On that day the State sought and, without opposition, was granted leave to rely upon an amended summons. 

8The matter was heard on 19 October 2011. For the reasons articulated below, I have decided that an extended supervision order ought be made for a period of five years upon the conditions sought by the State. 

Nature of the Proceeding 

9The amended summons sought an order pursuant to the SSO Act in the following terms: 

""3. An order pursuant to section 9(1)(a) of the Act that the defendant be subject to an extended supervision order for a period of 5 years from the date of the order and pursuant to section 11 of the Act, direct that the defendant comply with the conditions set out in the Schedule to this Summons."" 

10As well, a further order was sought by the State, and was not opposed by Mr De La Torre, in the following terms: 

""4. An order that access to the Court file in respect of any documents shall not be granted without the leave of a Judge of the Court. If any application for access is made by a non-party in respect of any document, the parties are to be notified by the Registrar so as to be given the opportunity to be heard."" 

11The schedule to the summons sought the imposition of 50 different conditions. Mr De La Torre agreed to all of those conditions and did not oppose their imposition, but he sought that one additional condition ought be imposed. The State opposed that condition. 

12Mr De La Torre only put in issue two matters, namely: 

(a) whether an additional condition, namely Condition 9(a), which related to the assessment of reasonable accommodation, ought be included; and 

(b) whether the 5 year period sought in the summons for the extended supervision order was appropriate. He instead submitted that a 3 year period was appropriate. 

13In order to determine whether the Court should make the orders in the summons, and for what period and upon what conditions, it is necessary to examine the SSO Act and the relevant authorities which provide guidance to the implementation of the SSO Act. 

14It is appropriate to note the particular context in which the Court's determination takes place. It is one in which Mr De La Torre, who is represented by counsel, consents to the making of an extended supervision order, except for a period more than three years. It is one in which he does not himself give evidence, nor does he tender evidence in his case. His counsel does not seek to cross-examine any of the deponents in the State's case. His counsel does not request any of the doctors who have provided a report to be made available for cross-examination. 

15In short, the matter proceeded, largely by consent, and without challenge to the evidence relied upon by the State. 

16Nevertheless, the Court is called upon to exercise a discretion in a way which fulfils the object of the SSO Act. 

Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 

17The Act has two objects. They are set out in s 3 in the following terms: 

""3. Objects of Act 

(1) The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community. 

(2) Another object of this Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation."" 

18Mr De La Torre is, by reason of the crimes for which he was sentenced by Rummery J in the District Court of NSW on 28 February 1997, a sex offender within the meaning of the Act. Some, at least, of those crimes constituted serious sex offences within the meaning of the Act. 

19The terms upon which this Court may make an order of the kind sought in the Summons are set forth in s 9 of the Act. That is in the following form: 

"" 9 Determination of application for extended supervision order 

(1) The Supreme Court may determine an application for an extended supervision order: 
(a) by making an extended supervision order, or 
(b) by dismissing the application. 
(2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 
(2A) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence. 
(3) In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant: 
(a) the safety of the community, 
(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender's participation in any such examination, 
(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender's participation in any such assessment, 
(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, 
(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community, 
(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender's participation in any such programs, 
(f) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order, 
(g) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004, 
(h) the offender's criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history, 
(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender, 
(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature."" 

20The maximum period for which an extended supervision order may be made is five years. However, the State may apply for a second or further extended supervision order against the same offender: s 10 of the SSO Act. 

21When making an extended supervision order, the court may direct an offender to comply with such conditions as it thinks appropriate, including those specified in s 11 of the SSO Act. 

22It is of importance, in considering the appropriate order to make, to recognise that a supervision order once made may be varied or revoked. Section 13 of the Act is in the following terms: 

"" 13 Supervision order may be varied or revoked 

(1) The Supreme Court may at any time vary or revoke an extended supervision order or interim supervision order on the application of the State of New South Wales or the offender. 
(1A) The period of an order must not be varied so that the period is greater than that otherwise permitted under this Part. 
(2) For the purpose of ascertaining whether to make such an application in relation to an extended supervision order, the Commissioner of Corrective Services must provide the Attorney General with a report on the offender at intervals of not more than 12 months."" 

23There have been a number of authorities which it is appropriate to consider in the hearing and determination of an application of this kind. Attorney-General for NSW v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 is authority for these propositions: 

(a) The SSO Act is protective rather than punitive in its intent as is revealed by the stated objects in s 3: at [5]; 

(b) The conditions which the Court considers appropriate which may be imposed upon an extended supervision order can impose constraint as well as positive obligations. Such conditions can extend to ordering mandatory participation in treatment and rehabilitation programs: at [10]; 

(c) The standard of proof is high for the making of final orders: at [18]; 

(d) The powers under the respective provisions, including s 9, entail a discretion, enabling the Court to refuse to make an order in a proper case even if the necessary pre-conditions are satisfied: at [32]. 

24In Cornwall v Attorney-General for NSW [2007] NSWCA 374 at [21], the Court held that the expression "" ... a high degree of probability "" indicated that the likelihood of an offender committing a further serious sex offence 

""...does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. "" 

25The Court was also careful to note that: 

""the risk or likelihood itself does not have to be a probability to the civil standard of proof, but rather a sufficiently substantial probability to satisfy the criterion 'likely'."" 

26I should also note that, although dissenting in the result, Kirby J in Fardo v Attorney-General for Qld (2004) 223 CLR 575, said that predictions of criminal dangerousness have long been recognised by experts in law, psychology and criminology to be unreliable: at [124]. He drew attention to the remarks of Professor Kate Warner in ""Sentencing review 2002-2003"" (2003) 27 Crim LJ 325 at 338 where she said: 

""... An obstacle to preventative detention is the difficulty of prediction. Psychiatrists notoriously overpredict. Predictions of dangerousness have been shown to have only a one third to 50% success rate ... While actuarial predictions have been shown to be better than clinical predictions - an interesting point as psychiatric or clinical predictions are central to continuing detention orders - neither are accurate."" 

27Kirby J went on to say at [125] this: 

""Judges of this Court have referred to such unreliability ... Even with the procedures and criteria adopted, the Act ultimately deprives people such as the appellant of personal liberty, a most fundamental human right, on a prediction of dangerousness, based largely on the opinions of psychiatrists which can only be, at best, an educated or informed 'guess'."" 

28I approach the discharge of the consideration of the matters in this case having regard to the caution expressed by Kirby J, but nevertheless recognising that the legislation has provided the relevant discretion to the Court and that the discretion is one in which it is proper for the Court to exercise. 

Mr De La Torre 

29It is appropriate to record some features of Mr De La Torre and his history which form some of the fundamental matters of fact upon which the orders are sought. 

(a) Criminal history (including views of the sentencing court): s 9(3)(h) and s 9(3)(h1) Crime (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 

30On 12 September 1990, Mr De La Torre was arrested and taken into custody as a consequence of his conduct on that day. On 27 March 1991 he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping contrary to s 90A Crimes Act 1900, and one count of indecent assault with act of indecency contrary to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act . 

31The maximum penalty for the first of those two offences was 20 years, and the maximum penalty for the second of those two offences was four years. 

32The learned sentencing judge, Abadee J, recorded his findings in his Remarks on Sentence. 

33In brief, the offences were committed in circumstances where Mr De La Torre, having hired a motor vehicle, drove around the streets of Orange. By a ruse, he enticed a nine year old girl into his motor vehicle and then drove the motor vehicle some distance from the city of Orange and kept the young girl confined as a passenger in the vehicle. At one point in time during the course of the victim being in the motor vehicle, Mr De La Torre placed his hand underneath the victim's school tunic and touched her on the top of her leg near her underpants. 

34The prisoner returned the victim to the city of Orange where he dropped her off near Orange High School. At the time he did so, he threatened the victim that if she told anyone, he would return and "" get her "". 

35Abadee J expressed these remarks about the offence: 

""In relation to the events, I am satisfied that they occurred in circumstances which created for this young girl feelings of terror, horror, fear and apprehension as to what was to happen to her. Such was further compounded by what in fact did happen to her. She was not merely taken into a car in the city area, but driven from the town to a lonely area of the countryside. The matter is also aggravated by the threat made to her following the indecent assault and before she was released ..."" 

36His Honour noted that he took a serious view of the offence which he found fell within the serious category. 

37He imposed concurrent sentences of a minimum five year non-parole period for the kidnapping offence and a fixed term of imprisonment of one year for the indecent assault offence. His Honour directed that the earliest date upon which Mr De La Torre would be eligible for release on parole was 11 September 1995. 

38Mr De La Torre was released from Kirkconnell Corrective Centre pursuant to an order for parole on 11 September 1995. 

39It was not long before Mr De La Torre was again offending. In the period from 1 December 1995 through to 30 April 1996, Mr De La Torre committed two offences of indecently assaulting a person under 10 years of age, contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act . The first of these offences occurred when Mr De La Torre was present in the house with a nine year female child. Whilst that child was visiting him with her parent, Mr De La Torre was with her in a bedroom without adult supervision. He kissed her on the lips for about a minute having pushed her onto the bed in a bedroom. He held the victim down and attempted to remove her underpants. The victim resisted and so Mr De La Torre discontinued this conduct, but persisted with an indecent assault by rubbing the victim with his hand on the outside of her clothes in the area of her vagina. 

40The second of the two indecent assault offences occurred whilst a five year old female was playing on a slippery dip in a park in the housing estate where Mr De La Torre lived. Whilst the five year old was happily playing, Mr De La Torre inserted his hand between her legs and rubbed her on the outside of her clothing in the area of her vagina. 

41On 10 July 1996, whilst living as Jesmond, Mr De La Torre took his small dog for a walk in bushland adjacent to a cycleway in the Jesmond Park area. In the park, he approached a number of young children of both sexes, but ultimately made contact with a nine year old girl. He enticed the young child to a concealed area of the bushland which was completely hidden from public view. He removed his victim's clothing and made her lie down naked on the ground on her back. He then produced a tube of lubricant and smeared some of this into the victim's vagina. He then undertook an act of forceful penile-vaginal intercourse, ultimately withdrawing his penis and ejaculating onto his victim. He required the victim to dress herself and returned her to the main park area and then left. 

42At the sentencing which occurred before Rummery DCJ in the District Court of NSW on 28 February 1997, Mr De La Torre asked that five further charges of conduct contrary to s 61M(2) of indecent assault upon a child under the age of ten years and a further two charges contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act of indecent assault upon a child under the age of 16 years, all of which occurred at Kelso near Bathurst between 1 December 1995 and 31 May 1996, be taken into account when the Court dealt with his plea. 

43His Honour, the learned sentencing Judge, said this: 

""The series of sexual assaults occurred when the prisoner was on release from custody to serve on parole subject to conditions, an additional term of twenty months penal servitude following his sentence of one year for assault, commit act of indecency upon a nine year old victim concurrently with a longer sentence of five years for kidnapping his victim on her way home from school with her six year old sister. The series commenced about three months after the prisoner's release to parole and in breach of it. The assaults were also in breach of the condition of parole that he not be in the company of children under the age of sixteen years unless accompanied by a responsible adult. The most serious offences occurred when he was on bail for the Kelso offences, which bail also required him to be of good behaviour and to report daily to Mayfield Police."" 

(b) Treatment whilst in custody: s 9(3)(e) Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 

44In the initial period of imprisonment between 1990 and 1995, Mr De La Torre was seen individually by prison psychologists on a large number of occasions. By late 1993 he had participated in both group and individual sessions, with the ""Sex Offender Assessment Program"" at the Cooma Correctional Centre. 

45In 1994, having been relocated to the Kirkconnell Correctional Centre, Mr De La Torre engaged in a ""structured Relapse Prevention Program"". Whilst at Kirkconnell Mr De La Torre engaged in at least 18 sessions with the prison psychologist, who ultimately strongly recommended that his community reintegration would be assisted by him going into community treatment with a qualified and experienced psychologist. 

46During the course of an interview on 18 June 2011, Mr De La Torre told Mr Patrick Sheehan, the senior specialist psychologist attached to the Serious Sex Offender Review Group, that his interaction with therapists whilst both in custody and during his period in the community, had not been genuine. I agree that this was so. It does not stand to his credit on this application. He does not appear to have been willing to participate in these treatment programs. 

47During his second period of custody, Mr De La Torre participated in the CUBIT Program between 28 February 2007 and 18 February 2008. The CUBIT Program is a custodial based intensive treatment program facilitated by a specially trained psychologist. It is designed for sex offenders who are assessed as being within the moderate to high risk category, and thus requiring modest to high treatment needs. 

48It is an intensive, residential, group-based treatment program during which participants learn and practice their behaviour in a therapeutic environment that is closely monitored. It generally requires eight to ten months to complete. Although the format is primarily group-based, that is augmented by individual sessions. 

49The psychologist overseeing the CUBIT Program, and Mr De La Torre's participation in it, wrote this in a discharge summary of 13 May 2008: 

""During his time in CUBIT, Mr [De La Torre] appeared motivated and engaged in treatment to address his offending behaviour. He participated satisfactorily in group processes and was an active member of the CUBIT community. Over the course of treatment Mr [De La Torre] took responsibility for his offending behaviour and the full extent of the harm that this caused. He developed a proficient understanding of the factors that contributed to his offending and he constructed meaningful self management plans to assist him to intervene in problematic behaviours and set up his life so that it is not conducive to sexual offending. At times Mr [De La Torre] appeared to have some difficulties implementing his management strategies when he was experiencing intense emotions."" 

50I am satisfied that Mr De La Torre willingly and fully participated in this treatment program, and has benefited by his participation. 

51It was recommended that Mr De La Torre participate in the Custodial Maintenance Program upon his discharge from the CUBIT Program. 

52On 9 April 2008, up to and including 4 August 2010, Mr De La Torre participated in the Custodial Maintenance Program. This is a group-based psycho-therapeutic program designed for men convicted of sexual offences who have completed a program such as CUBIT. 

53Over the two years of his participation, Mr De La Torre attended 42 treatment sessions. 

54The relevant notes and reports indicate that overall, Mr De La Torre, could be described as having made further treatment gains during this period. It is also clear, particularly from the report of Mr Sheehan of 23 June 2011, that although progress was initially slow, as he continued to progress through the Custodial Maintenance Program, Mr De La Torre experienced fewer episodes of negative coping and developed an increased ability to intervene earlier when such behaviours did surface. 

55It was noted during the course of the Custodial Maintenance Program, that despite encouragement by maintenance therapists, Mr De La Torre continued to decline the offer of assessment for anti-libidinal medication. 

56Notwithstanding this declining of an assessment for anti-libidinal medication, I am satisfied that Mr De La Torre fully and willingly participated in the Custodial Maintenance Program. 

57Mr De La Torre was released from custody in December 2010. He was then accommodated at Nunyara. 

58He commenced in the Community Maintenance Program, a similar program to that which occurred during his custody, and has continued in that Program, attending it on a weekly basis. His attendance and participation have been satisfactory. 

(c) Diagnosis and Risk: s 9(3)(b), s 9(3)(c) and s 9(3)(d) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 

59On 15 November 2010, Dr Satish Dayalan, a consultant forensic psychiatrist with Justice Health, concluded that in accordance with DSM-IV-TR, Mr De La Torre would be diagnosed with the condition known as Paedophilia Non-Exclusive type. 

60Dr Anthony Samuels, one of the two forensic psychiatrists appointed by Adams J in accordance with s 7(4) of the SSO Act, in a report of 7 September 2011, also concluded that Mr De La Torre fulfilled the criteria in DSM-IV-TR for Paedophilia Non-Exclusive type. He noted that there were suggestions from Mr Sheehan's Risk Assessment Report of other paraphilia, but no clear evidence for this. 

61Mr Sheehan, in his report of 23 June 2011, accepted as accurate the diagnosis of Dr Dayalan. 

62In a report of 8 October 2011, Dr Andrew Ellis, who was one of the two forensic psychiatrists appointed by Adams J in accordance with s 7(4) of the SSO Act, concluded that Mr De La Torre would meet the: 

""...diagnostic criteria for the paraphilias of paedophilia, voyeurism, masochism and fetishism. Paedophilia is subtyped as attracted to females, and non-exclusive."" 

63Dr Ellis noted that although Mr De La Torre had suffered depression in the past, and was possibly at risk of future episodes of depression, that he did not currently meet the criteria for a mood disorder. 

64A number of experts have assessed Mr De La Torre's risk of re-offending. Mr Sheehan, in his affidavit of 14 October 2011, expressed the opinion that having regard to both actuarial assessment using the STATIC-99R and Dynamic Risk Assessment, that Mr De La Torre presented a high risk of sexually re-offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders. 

65He expressed this opinion: 

""65. In my view when Mr De La Torre's parole order expires, the likelihood of him being able to successfully manage his risk of sexual recidivism would be enhanced if supportive resources, supervisory conditions and monitoring were made available. Conversely, continued supervisory conditions and monitoring would be likely to decrease the risk of Mr De La Torre re-offending. ... 

66. The mitigation of future risk will require community supervision and support until such a time that Mr De La Torre can reliably demonstrate the ability to respond effectively to life stressors without recourse to the pathological coping behaviours associated with his sexual offending."" 

66Dr Anthony Samuels, in his report of 7 September 2011 expressed the opinion that Mr De La Torre was at moderate to high risk of committing a further sexual offence if not supervised. Dr Samuels arrived at this opinion by utilising a structured professional judgment approach which incorporated elements of clinical risk assessment, actuarial risk assessment and structured professional guidelines. 

67Dr Ellis in his report of 8 October 2011, expressed this opinion: 

""In considering actuarial and clinical parameters in the absence of any treatment or supervision, Mr De La Torre would fall into a group of persons with a risk of offending that is high, and greater than a theoretical average offender. Treatment and supervision would likely reduce this risk."" 

68It is apparent from his report that Dr Ellis had regard to the STATIC-99R actuarial measure and as well, clinical considerations. 

69A number of the experts gave consideration to the type of possible or hypothetical sexual offences that should be considered when estimating risk. They each separately concluded, in similar terms, that the most likely type of victim would a female child in a situation in which the child and Mr De La Torre were alone, or else their interaction occurred in a position of vulnerability. 

70I conclude upon the basis of these opinions that there is a high risk of Mr De La Torre committing a serious sex offence if he does not accept treatment and supervision. 

Other Mandatory Relevant Considerations 

71Section 9(3) of the SSO Act requires that the Court must have regard to a number of listed matters in determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order. I have already addressed a number of them. It is appropriate that I address the matters which remain. 

(a) Safety of the Community: s 9(3)(a) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 

72In my opinion, the safety of the community generally, and that particular group within the community of young females, is at high risk if Mr De La Torre is released into the community without supervision. 

73Put in another way, there is a real risk of Mr De La Torre committing a further offence if he is released into the community without treatment. The safety of the community cannot be ensured if Mr De La Torre is released without any extended supervision order. 

74It follows that from the perspective of the community, an extended supervision order, with appropriate conditions is necessary for protection of the community. 

(b) Expert Reports: s 9(3)(b) Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 

75As noted above, I have received and had regard to the reports of Dr Samuels and Dr Ellis, who were the psychiatrists appointed by Adams J under s 7(4) of the Act, to conduct examinations of Mr De La Torre. I am satisfied from the contents of those reports that Mr De La Torre participated in a satisfactory way in the consultations and examinations, and I have had close regard to the opinions expressed by each of the experts and the material upon which those opinions were based. 

(c) Corrective Services Commission Report: s 9(3)(d1) Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 

76Mr Jonny George, whose opinion is contained in an affidavit affirmed on 17 October 2011, is responsible for formulating the risk management plan for Mr De La Torre and, as well, reviewing and adjusting that plan as required over a period of time. 

77A Risk Management Plan has been prepared which is contained in a report of Corrective Services NSW and which is annexed to Mr George's affidavit. 

78The report contains the following to which I have had careful regard: 

""As part of Mr De La Torre's case management, a case management plan has been formulated which incorporates the strategies recommended in the proposed Risk Management plan. The case management plan takes into consideration recommendations of assessing psychologists and psychiatrists and seeks to develop a management plan which encourages the successful reintegration of the offender into the community whilst maintaining public safety. 

... 

The Risk Management Plan (RMP) produced below demonstrates the strategies utilised by the [Community Compliance and Monitoring Group] to reasonably and practically manage the offender in the community. These strategies seek to address criminogenic factors, reduce the risk of re-offending and enhance the safety of the community."" 

79Mr George, in his affidavit, notes that he agrees with the Risk Management Plan and expresses his view that the plan will reasonable and practically manage Mr De La Torre in the community. 

80I am satisfied on the evidence of Mr George and the proposed Risk Management Plan Report compiled by Nicholas Vrzic on 2 August 2011, that Mr De La Torre can be reasonably and practically managed in the community if an extended supervision order were made. 

(d) Compliance with Obligations: s 9(3)(f) Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 

81Since being released on parole in December 2010, the evidence satisfies me that Mr De La Torre has complied with any obligations to which he has been subject, including such obligations as existed in accordance with the interim extended supervision order made by Adams J in April 2011. 

(e) Other Mandatory Matters: s (3)(g) Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 

82There is no material before me to indicate that Mr De La Torre has failed to comply with any obligations pursuant to the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004. I have recounted his criminal history, including any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history, and I have taken into account the views of the sentencing courts, namely Abadee J and Rummery DCJ, considering the making of an extended supervision order. 

83There is nothing in the views of the sentencing court which would suggest that such an order should not, at this time, be made. 

Period of Any Order 

84The State of NSW submits that the appropriate period for any order is five years. 

85Counsel for Mr De La Torre does not oppose the making of an order but submits that any order ought be made only for three years. 

86Dr Samuels in his report expresses his opinion in this way: 

""It seems likely that Mr De La Torre is going to represent an ongoing risk to the community and a 5 year order would seem appropriate from a psychiatric perspective."" 

87Dr Samuels goes on to note that it may be appropriate across this period to review the conditions imposed on Mr De La Torre in order that he might be "" rewarded for the progress he makes "" and as well, because "" over time allowing him slightly more freedom will be a test of his progress "". 

88Dr Ellis in his report, expressed a sound basis for the period of five years as opposed to any shorter period. He said: 

""A period of five years would be suggested in order to establish a baseline function in the community, and refine the appraisal of risk. It is most likely that a period of 12 months will be required to secure stable accommodation and regular meaningful activity in the community, given the restrictions on persons subject to extended supervision orders. During this period of time, it is unlikely that a person will have the focus to benefit from intense therapeutic activity. A further 36 months of regular treatment in a psychological programme, coupled with medication and review of this medication would be necessary to consolidate the modest gains made in custodial programs. This period is estimated based on his personality disorder and paraphilia that will be unlikely to change in the short term. Involvement in structured activity and appropriate social groups will also consolidate a routine promoting a positive lifestyle. A further period of 12 months would be required to monitor the consolidation. At this point a more informed appraisal of future risk in progress could be made."" 

89Mr De La Torre did not adduce any evidence from any expert psychiatrist or psychologist to challenge either this opinion or the opinion of Dr Samuels. He did not adduce any evidence which suggested that three years was the appropriate period for an extended supervision order. His counsel did not seek to challenge by cross-examination the opinions expressed by Dr Ellis or Dr Samuels. 

90Where a witness, including an expert, is not cross-examined, then, prima facie, the Court ought to accept the unchallenged evidence: Ali v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 183 at [112] per Tobias and McColl JJA. However, such evidence is not necessarily to be accepted where either there is a credible body of contradictory evidence, or the evidence is on its face illogical or inherently inconsistent. I do not regard the evidence as falling into either of those categories. I note that no submission was made that the evidence was on its face, illogical or inherently inconsistent, and as I have earlier pointed out, there was no evidence adduced which contradicted what Dr Ellis or Dr Samuels said. 

91In the case of an expert, if the evidence is based on a history that is incomplete or incorrect, or else where the factual assumptions that the expert makes are not made out, then the Court may disregard even, unchallenged, expert evidence: Hull v Thompson [2001] NSWCA 359 at [21] per Rolfe AJA (Sheller JA and Davies AJA agreeing). There is no suggestion here of any inaccuracy or unreliability of the history relied upon by either Dr Samuels or Dr Ellis. 

92In this case, I find the evidence of Dr Ellis persuasive. It is logical and it provides a proper basis for his opinion that the appropriate length of an extended supervision order is five years and not something shorter. 

93In particular, I note that he regards a period of three years of regular treatment in a psychological program and a period of review thereafter as being essential. This opinion is inconsistent with the defendant's submission that the order ought only extend for three years. 

94I am satisfied that it is both necessary and appropriate for the period of the extended supervision order to be five years. 

95I note that in the event, as hoped, Mr De La Torre makes significant progress, so that some of the conditions ought be modified, then he is at liberty in accordance with the SSO Act, to bring proceedings seeking a variation to any extended supervision order. In those proceedings, the onus would fall on him to persuade the Court that such a variation ought be made. 

96I do not regard this as unfair or unjust, as his counsel submitted, because ultimately the primary object to be achieved by an extended supervision order is the protection of the public. His rehabilitation, whilst not inimical to the primary purpose, is not the primary purpose. 

Accommodation Condition 

97Mr De La Torre's counsel submits that the Court ought impose a condition in the following terms, in addition to all other of the suggested conditions: 

9(a) The Departmental Supervising Officer is not to refuse approval for any accommodation proposed by the Defendant, by reason only that any such accommodation has shared kitchen, bathroom, or common room areas. 

98Mr De La Torre's counsel submitted that given that his client has a limited income, and was keen to live in independent accommodation, an aim approved of by Corrective Services NSW, that many places of accommodation within the affordable price range would have a shared kitchen, bathroom or a common recreation area. 

99Mr De La Torre drew attention to a number of entries in the Case Notes which he submitted indicated that Corrective Services NSW had an intractable policy not to approve of accommodation where there was a shared kitchen, bathroom or a common recreation area. 

100According to the Case Note reports, on 6 August 2011, as a consequence of a phone call with a staff member, Mr Simon Gray, the following is recorded: 

""Offender states the property he is proposing has a communal bathroom - advised offender he would not be able to live in a property with a communal bathroom as CCMG need to be able to manage a risk. Explained CCMG would not be able to manage this risk appropriately as it was impossible to determine who would have access to a communal bathroom and there is a duty of care to both the offender, other residents and visitors to the property."" 

101On 14 August 2011, in a further Case Note of a review discussion, the following note is to be found: 

""Discussed his restrictions on accommodation. Roy is finding it difficult to find suitable accommodation with the restrictions of the 500 metre rule in communal living. He stated he had looked through almost 80 properties in the last fortnight. At this point ASW interrupted and reminded Roy that he had been informed numerous times by staff that exemptions can be applied for and that this had been confirmed by CCMG. 

102On 31 August 2011, a further entry is contained to this effect: 

""Also discussed accommodation and the difficulty in finding suitable properties. Advised CCMG realised the difficulties in obtaining suitable accommodation but it would not be approved for him to live in a property with shared bathrooms etc with members of the public. Advised he would need to continue searching and CCMG would only be able to consider properties on a case by case basis."" 

103As well, the Case Notes contained numerous references to difficulties that Mr De La Torre had in finding suitable accommodation. Of interest, most of the difficulties seemed to be associated with the geographical location of the accommodation in relation to the presence of schools, childcare centres or other like places, where it might be expected that children would gather. 

104I am satisfied from reading all of the Case Note reports that considerable care and attention is being paid by the relevant CCMG staff to obtaining suitable accommodation for Mr De La Torre, or else approving suitable accommodation found by Mr De La Torre for himself. 

105I am reluctant, by the making of a specific condition of the kind that Mr De La Torre seeks, to interfere with what may be a general policy, which is soundly based. Accordingly, I will not impose the condition sought. 

106However, it is appropriate that I record these remarks. What seems to me to be relevant is that the accommodation in which Mr De La Torre is to live, is a place which enables him to comfortably comply with all of the conditions imposed with his extended supervision order. It is obviously in his interests that he be accommodated independently of Nunyara and to live in the community. There seems to be no disagreement about this. 

107However, I do note that when Mr De La Torre travels to work or, with approval, to other places of social recreation, that it is essential at those places that he shares toilets, recreational areas, and at his work place, a kitchen or kitchenette with others. The CCMG has no control over who might be in those places at any given time. 

108Indeed, as counsel for Mr De La Torre submitted, he is entitled to use public toilets as he travels to and from work and his place of residence. 

109In other words, it is not possible for Mr De La Torre to live, work and socialise in the community without, from time to time, accessing communal facilities such as bathrooms, kitchens and recreation rooms. 

110What seems to me to be important is not the fact of those rooms being communal, but rather who it is likely Mr De La Torre will encounter when he uses those rooms. 

111Having regard to that likelihood, I have no doubt that some communal accommodation, to use a shorthand term, would be entirely acceptable, whereas others might not be. 

112In short, I will not impose the condition requested, but I do express my view that if such a rule exists, then it ought not be inflexibly applied. 

Summary 

113I am satisfied on all of the material that, to a high degree of probability, Mr De La Torre poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. 

114I am satisfied that the period of supervision ought be five years. 

115I am not satisfied that I ought impose the condition with respect to accommodation which Mr De La Torre seeks. 

Undertaking 

116It is appropriate that, before proceeding to make orders, I record the terms of an undertaking to the Court made by the plaintiff. It is this: 

The State of New South Wales will pay for any cost relating to the electronic monitoring of the defendant, including the costs of installing, maintaining and operating the electronic monitoring equipment. 

117Were it not for that undertaking, I would not have been prepared to make an extended supervision order upon the conditions sought by the State. 

Orders 

(1)I order, pursuant to s 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 that Mr De La Torre be subject to an Extended Supervision Order for a period of five years from 28 October 2011; 

(2)I order pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 that Mr De La Torre comply with the conditions set out in Schedule A which is attached to this judgment; 

(3)I order that access to the court file in respect of any document shall not be granted without the leave of a Judge of the Court; 

(4)I direct that in the event that any application for access is made by a non-party to the matter in respect of any document contained on the court file, that the Registrar of the Court is to notify the parties to the summons and provide them with an opportunity to make submissions with respect to whether that access should or should not be granted.

		28 October 2011",2011-10-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709020,R v Hawi & ors (No 32) [2011] NSWSC 1678,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Last Friday I received a note from the jury (MFI.122): 

""We believe at this point in time we will be unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the primary charges."" 

2Earlier last Friday the jury sent a note (MFI.121) which said, in part: 

""Update on where we are at. We are still finding it difficult to come to unanimous dec isions on the primary charges. Is there any direction we can be provided to resolve our stalemate. There has been movement on individual decisions, however not to the point of a unanimous decision. "" 

3In relation to that note, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that it was time to consider giving the jury a majority verdict direction. I raised with counsel the question whether one of the preconditions in s 55F of the Jury Act 1977 was satisfied, that is whether: 

(2)(a) ... the jurors have deliberated for a period of time (being not less than 8 hours) that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings... 

4Some counsel submitted that reasonable time had elapsed whilst others did not oppose such a finding being made. 

5The nature and complexity of the proceedings are clearly such that a period greatly in excess of the minimum of eight hours for the jury's deliberations would be appropriately regarded as reasonable. 

6To state the matter shortly, there are 7 accused and 25 potential verdicts to consider. The transcript of the evidence exceeds 4000 pages. The jury have a copy of that transcript. There are, in addition, a very large number of exhibits which include a multitude of sequences of security camera footage. Counsel invited the jury's close attention to the evidence in the course of their closing addresses, which spanned some 11 sitting days. My summing-up spanned 6 days, although not all of them were full days. 

7The jury retired to commence their deliberations on 29 September 2011. Their deliberations continued for what is now 18 days or approximately 94 hours. 

8I am satisfied that the jury have deliberated for a period of time that is reasonable in the circumstances. 

9The other precondition in s 55F is: 

2(b) the court is satisfied, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation. 

10I propose to have the foreperson sworn or affirmed and ask her a question to that effect. If her response is in the affirmative, then I propose to direct the jury that majority verdicts may be returned. 

11A question was raised last Friday as to whether there needs to be some discrimination as to the charges upon which majority verdicts may be returned. That is, whether it is only on what might be termed ""primary charges"", or whether it could include alternative charges. I am satisfied that majority verdicts would be acceptable on any of the charges, whether they be primary or alternative. I can see no practical way, or legal necessity, for there to be any discrimination.

		14 February 2012",2011-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709021,R v Hawi & ors (No 30) [2011] NSWSC 1676,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: On 1 September 2011, I gave judgment on an application by Mr Gordon, counsel for the accused Kisacanin, that certain video evidence be either excluded in his case, or that a direction be given limiting its use. The application was refused in both respects: R v Hawi & ors (No 27) . 

2Mr Gordon then applied for the discharge of the jury in respect of Mr Kisacanin (T4136). He had foreshadowed that he would make such an application in the event that the first application failed (T4134). 

3After hearing submissions on the application I indicated that it was refused. These are my reasons. 

4The application was put on the basis that there was irreparable prejudice for two reasons which I will deal with in turn. 

Late notification of evidence relied upon by the Crown in the case against the accused Kisacanin 

5One of the items of video evidence that was the subject of my judgment of 1 September 2011 was what has been referred to as ""the Deng footage"". The Crown had only indicated in the course of responding to an application for directed verdicts of acquittal on 15 August 2011 that it proposed to submit to the jury that certain aspects of the appearance of a person carrying a bollard in that footage were consistent with Mr Kisacanin. 

Mr Gordon referred to the manner in which the case for Mr Kisacanin had been conducted prior to 15 August 2011. He referred to himself having opened to the jury in these terms: 

In relation to Mr Kisacanin, he was one of those who walked through the security check and there was no weapon of any sort on him when he went through. There was no question about that. There was no evidence about a weapon. There was no evidence that he was involved in any way with a knife or a knuckleduster or anything else. (T125.28) 

6Mr Gordon then submitted: 

That was the way in which I opened the case to the jury, and thereafter I have taken a low profile throughout the trial and have not sought to cross-examine any witness in relation to the activities that are seen involving bollards in and around the area of the Deng footage in particular, there being no described individual who fitted the description of Kisacanin, either by cap or otherwise, and there being no reason at that stage for me to believe that the Crown was relying on any CCTV footage beyond that set out in camera 404. (T4137.36) 

7I accept that Mr Gordon did not cross-examine witnesses on ""the activities that are seen involving bollards in and around the area of the Deng footage"", or about whether any individual in that area could have been Mr Kisacanin. However, Mr Gordon did not explain why he would have done so if he had been aware at an earlier time of the Crown's contention in relation to the Deng footage. 

8Doing the best I can in the absence of any such explanation, it seems to me that such cross-examination would not have achieved anything, but would have run the risk of having a witness say something that would have raised the possibility that Mr Kisacanin was in fact in that area. 

9Aside from the evidence of one witness (Ms Redford), which I will mention shortly, the only direct evidence relied upon by the Crown in relation to Mr Kisacanin's ""activities"" in the departure hall is the Deng footage and the footage from security camera 404. Cross-examination of witnesses to establish a negative, when, aside from Ms Redford, there was already a negative, does not appear to have been a course that could have been undertaken for any useful purpose. 

Failure by the Crown to comply with the rule in Browne v Dunn by not seeking leave to cross-examine a prosecution witness concerning an aspect of a description 

10Ms Redford was a Qantas employee who was working at one of the check-in counters. She witnessed certain aspects of the riot in the departure hall. Her description of what she saw included that she saw a man pick up a bollard over his left shoulder and swing it. At that point, she looked away in order to press a duress button. She described this man as having a big build, with tattoos on his arms and wearing a dark grey singlet (T947-948). 

11Mr Kisacanin was wearing a grey singlet. He could be regarded as having a big build. However, he had no visible tattoos. 

12The Crown Prosecutor made the following submission concerning this evidence on the application for directed verdicts: 

The person she describes with the grey singlet, she also describes as having tattoos and there is no suggestion on the Crown case that Mr Kisacanin has tattoos and Mr Gordon cross-examined her on that issue at page 956. However, in our respectful submission the extent to which it may be suggested by Mr Gordon that it can't be Mr Kisacanin because he doesn't have tattoos cuts both ways, in that she may well be wrong about the tattoos, and it certainly is evidence of someone in a grey singlet wielding a bollard as described by Ms Redford. (T3679.43) 

13Mr Gordon submitted that there had been a failure to comply with the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. The Crown had not sought to challenge Ms Redford's evidence that the man she saw had tattoos. As a result, so it was submitted, there was ""great prejudice arising to the defence"" (T4137.22). 

14Mr Gordon did not suggest how it was that the case concerning his client had suffered prejudice. It was not asserted that it had come as a surprise that the Crown was relying upon the evidence of Ms Redford and that the case for Mr Kisacanin would have been conducted differently if this had been known at an earlier time. 

15It is does not appear that the Crown would have had a basis to cross-examine Ms Redford so as to positively assert that the man she saw did not have tattoos. The most, it would seem, that could have been done by way of cross-examination would have been to inquire whether she was sure about the tattoos. What this would have achieved in terms of assisting the case for Mr Kisacanin is something I fail to see. Moreover, whether leave would have been granted to the Crown to cross-examine Ms Redford upon the basis that her evidence was ""unfavourable"" is not entirely self-evident: see ss 38 and 192 Evidence Act 1995. 

16Ms Redford is not the only witness in this trial in respect of whom the Crown relies upon some of the evidence but suggests, or accepts, that other parts of the witness' testimony are incorrect. That is perfectly understandable when a large number of people are asked to give an account of an event which was quick, chaotic, unexpected and traumatic. 

The Crown Prosecutor raised a question early in the trial about whether any counsel would take issue if the Crown did not seek leave to cross-examine witnesses whenever there was something that the Crown did not accept in the evidence. She said that she was mindful of the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases such as R v Teasdale [2004] NSWCCA 91; (2004) 145 A Crim R 345 and R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 487; (2000) 118 A Crim R 34. See also Puchalski v R [2007] NSWCCA 220 at [68] - [79] and Causevic v R [2008] NSWCCA 238 at [34] - [35]. The outcome of the Crown Prosecutor raising this issue was recorded in the transcript as follows: 

HIS HONOUR: Does anyone feel that it is necessary for the Crown to cross-examine witnesses when there are matters of discrepancy such as these? 

(Counsel replied in the negative.) (T801.43) 

17I note that almost immediately after that, I indicated that if counsel did have any concerns about this issue they should be raised (T802.1). Thereafter, none were until the present application was made. 

18If the Crown Prosecutor had taken the view that it was necessary to cross-examine every witness whenever such a discrepancy appeared, the result would have been a significant extension to the length of an already long trial for little or no practical purpose. 

Conclusion 

19In relation to each matter, individually and collectively, I was not persuaded that there was prejudice to the case concerning Mr Kisacanin that would warrant the jury being discharged. For these reasons the application was refused.

		14 February 2012",2011-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709023,R v Biddle [2011] NSWSC 1262,"Judgment 

1On 20 February 2009, Clenton Biddle viciously attacked Christine Biddle, his wife, at their family property near Kempsey in New South Wales. 

2He did so by taking an iron bar, surreptitiously entering the family home, coming up behind his wife and striking her with a forceful blow on the head. He then continued to strike her on a number of occasions, including whilst she was lying prone on the ground and completely helpless. 

3The blows caused multiple fractures of Mrs Biddle's skull, multiple lacerations and serious brain injury. She did not recover and on 21 February 2009, she died without regaining consciousness. 

4Mr Biddle was arrested in the early hours of 21 February 2009 and has been in custody ever since. He was charged with murder. 

5On 24 June 2010, Mr Biddle offered to plead guilty to manslaughter. That plea was not accepted by the Crown, and Mr Biddle was committed by the Local Court at Port Macquarie to stand trial for murder in the Supreme Court. 

6On Monday 12 September 2011 when arraigned in front of the jury, Mr Biddle pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, but guilty of the offence of manslaughter. The Crown declined to accept this plea in full discharge of the indictment. 

7The trial proceeded. On Friday 23 September 2011, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder. 

8It is now time for Mr Biddle to be sentenced for his crime. 

9The Crimes Act 1900 provides a maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of murder of imprisonment for life. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides for a standard non-parole period of 20 years. 

Judicial Task on Sentencing 

10In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself of the judicial task on sentencing. 

11In the present system of criminal justice, I must exercise a discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon Mr Biddle by applying well identified principles of law to the facts which I find: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at 1-2. 

12The principles of law are well established and are conveniently summarised in the following way: 

""1. Where, following a trial by jury, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the power and responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender rest with the judge, and not with the jury...; 

2. Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing. Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings ...; 

3. The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision-making ... is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury ...; 

4. A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt ...; 

5. There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender.... However, the practical effect of 4 above, in a given case, may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender ..."". 

R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378; see also Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1. 

13The appropriate approach to sentencing is to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentencing, identify their significance with the particular circumstances of the offence and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence having regard to the purpose for which a sentence is to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [26]. 

14I will apply these principles in the course of this sentence. 

The Relevant Legislation 

15The Parliament of NSW has determined the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender. Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that those purposes are: 

""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 

(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 

(c) to protect the community from the offender, 

(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 

(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 

(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 

(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community."" 

16Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets out the relevant provisions that deal with sentencing procedures generally. Of particular importance are the terms of s 21A, which relevantly are as follows: 

"" 21A Aggravating, mitigating and other factors in sentencing 

(1) General 
In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters: 
(a) the aggravating factors referred to in subsection (2) that are relevant and known to the court, 
(b) the mitigating factors referred to in subsection (3) that are relevant and known to the court, 
(c) any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence. 
The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law. 

(2) Aggravating factors 
The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows: 
(a) ... 
(b) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence, 
(c) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon, 
... 
(eb) the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person, 
(f) ... 
(g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial, 
... 
The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 

(3) Mitigating factors 
The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows: 
(a) ... 
(b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, 
(c) the offender was provoked by the victim, 
(d) ... 
(e) the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions, 
(f) the offender was a person of good character, 
(g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend, 
(h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise, 
(i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if: 
(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and 
(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both), 
... 
(l) the degree of pre-trial disclosure by the defence (as provided by section 22A), 
(4) The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so. 
(5) The fact that any such aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence. 
..."" 

17As well, the provisions of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , are also applicable when considering the sentence in this matter because the crime of murder is specified as Item 1 in the Standard Non-Parole Period Table incorporated into that Division. The standard non-parole period applicable to this offence is 20 years. 

18The relevant statutory provisions are: 

"" 54A What is the standard non-parole period? 

(1) For the purposes of this Division, the standard non-parole period for an offence is the non-parole period set out opposite the offence in the Table to this Division. 
(2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division. 

54B Sentencing procedure 

(1) .... 
(2) When determining the sentence for the offence (not being an aggregate sentence), the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. 
(3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in section 21A. 
(4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account. 
(4A) ... 
(4B) ... 
(5) ... 

54C Court to give reasons if non-custodial sentence imposed 

(1) If the court imposes a non-custodial sentence for an offence set out in the Table to this Division, the court must make a record of its reasons for doing so. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each mitigating factor that it took into account. 
(2) ... 
(3) ..."" 

Principles of Sentencing 

19The courts have developed clear guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge. These common law principles are to be found in decided cases. 

20In summary, the common law principles include: 

(a)proportionality - namely that the sentence should be proportionate to the gravity of the offences: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ; 

(b)parity - namely, that any difference between sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence, ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, and to give the appearance that justice has not been done: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 617 per Dawson J, Gibbs CJ and Wilson J agreeing; 

(c)totality - namely, that when a person stands for sentence for a number of offences, the Court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and determine what the appropriate sentence is for all of the offences: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; 

(d)avoidance of double punishment - namely that a person should not be punished twice for the same conduct: Pearce v The Queen (1988) 194 CLR 610. 

21The importance of these principles is that s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act preserves the entire body of judicially developed sentencing principles: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [56]-[57]; Muldrock at [18]. 

22As well, factors established by the common law as affecting sentence, such as whether prison may be particularly burdensome, are also to be taken into account in accordance with s 21A: Muldrock at [19]. 

23In considering the imposition of a sentence under s 54B, the following considerations are appropriate: 

(a)The effect of the s 54B(2), despite its apparently mandatory terms, is to preserve the full scope of judicial discretion to impose a non-parole period longer or shorter than a standard non-parole period: Muldrock at [25]; 

(b)When read with s 21A, s 54B requires an approach to sentencing which is consistent with the judgment of McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]: Muldrock at [26]; 

(c)In considering all factors relevant to sentencing the Court must keep in mind the two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period: Muldrock at [27]; 

(d)In giving content in a specific case to the statutory phrase ""... an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness ..."", the assessment is made without reference to matters personal to an offender or class of offenders, and is made by reference wholly to the nature of the offending: Muldrock at [27]; 

(e)The standard non-parole period is not the starting point in sentencing for a mid-range offence after conviction: Muldrock at [31], nor does it have determinative significance in sentencing an offender: Muldrock at [32]. 

24I will need to bear in mind the legislation by which I am bound and the principles which the Courts have determined, when proceeding on this exercise of sentencing Mr Biddle. 

The Facts 

25I find the facts of the matter to be as follows. 

26Mr Biddle was born in March 1948 and was, accordingly, 60 at the time he killed his wife. They had known each for a very long time and had been married for approximately 41 years. 

27Their marriage had produced four children: Jennifer, Jody, Natasha and Dean. They were all adults in February 2009. 

28Their marriage was described as a reasonable one. That is not to say it was without its difficulties, but on the whole, the children regarded the marriage as being a typical ordinary marriage. 

29They lived on a property of about 130 acres to the east of Kempsey. The property had a substantial homestead, and a number of outbuildings. In one of those outbuildings there was a second accommodation area, in which their daughter Jennifer and her family were living in February 2009. 

30In the last few months of 2008, Mr Biddle had an extra-marital affair. Mrs Biddle discovered this in late December 2008. 

31On 1 January 2009, in the presence of some of her children, Mrs Biddle accused Mr Biddle of being engaged in the extra-marital affair. Although he initially denied it, when pressed and confronted with evidence he admitted to the affair. He then gave a description of what was involved in an attempt to minimise the impact of the affair on his wife and children. 

32There were angry scenes about his behaviour, which led to his wife telling him to leave the property. Mr Biddle grabbed a knife and threatened to commit suicide. He then drove off in his motorcar. 

33Later that afternoon, he was discovered at his service station in West Kempsey in circumstances where it was clear that he was contemplating, and perhaps had made some early steps toward, committing suicide. He had left a note which said, amongst other things: 

""I fucked up big time but I can't turn it back ... It is very 
hard to be thrown out of your own home by the people I love. I fucked up."" 

34He was prevented from committing suicide by the intervention of the police and was taken to the Kempsey District Hospital. There he was assessed and then released into the custody of his daughter, Natasha, who together with her family, then lived at Kundabung. 

35He remained living with Natasha and her family initially in her house and then in a family owned caravan on her property for some weeks. 

36During this time, as he told Professor Greenberg, although he felt saddened and upset about what had happened he nevertheless, after the first few days, was able to return to work and he continued to operate the service station reasonably successfully. 

37After some weeks, it appears that there was contact between Mrs Biddle and her husband. She suggested that he return to live on the property. However, he would only be allowed to live in the caravan which was to be moved to the property and parked in a shed near the house. He would be allowed into the house to shower and use the facilities to wash his clothes and his wife would cook for him, but otherwise they would conduct separate lives. This apparently had a good effect upon Mr Biddle and he returned willingly to live in those circumstances. 

38Towards the end of that period, conversations between he and his wife seemed to hold out hope that in due course, he might be able to return to live in the house, although his wife did not hold out the prospect of any marital reconciliation. 

39On 20 February 2009, Mr Biddle spent the day at work. He returned home via one of his children's houses where he spoke to and had a drink with, his son-in-law Mark Brady. Mr Brady's evidence was, and I am satisfied, that at that stage Mr Biddle was physically well and in a good mental state. 

40On the evening of 20 February 2009, there was a gathering on the back veranda of the homestead at Verges Creek. Present were Mr Biddle and his wife Christine, their children Jennifer and Dean, Jennifer's son, Jessie, and Dean's fiancee, Sharon. 

41The gathering seemed, at least initially, congenial. An argument then developed between Dean and his father, which led to a heated exchange of words and resulted in Dean pushing his father to the ground. Dean and his fiancee then left the property. 

42Jessie returned to the granny flat in which he lived with his mother and father. Mr and Mrs Biddle and Jennifer entered the house. A verbal exchange took place. It is adequate to reproduce a part of Jennifer's evidence which, I am satisfied, contained the substance of what occurred. She said at T61: 

""Mum just said [to Dad] 'You've just wrecked our whole life, our whole family, what we've worked for' and that 'I can't believe you just had three head jobs that she wouldn't give - you wouldn't give anything back in return to - to her' and then Dad put his hands up and said 'Yeah, I know, I've done the wrong thing.' "" 

43Mr Biddle went and had a shower. After having his shower, Mr Biddle helped himself to a beer and then sat down at a table at which his wife and Jennifer were also seated. There was a conversation, the substance of which was: 

Mr Biddle: I've done wrong, I know that but what do I need to do to rectify this problem? 

Mrs Biddle: You cannot fix it, Clenton. You've destroyed our lives, as we are finished. A couple that will never get back together. My life is my life, your life is your life. You do not ask me where I'm going, who I see and I will do the same to you. You are treading on thin ice and you are so close to getting kicked off this property. 

He then returned to the caravan in which he was sleeping after being told so to do by his wife. 

44Jennifer stayed with her mother for about an hour and a half. She then retired to the granny flat in which she lived and made preparations for retiring for the evening. This took about half an hour. 

45At that stage she and her husband, Mr Peter Bowell, heard a commotion. They looked back up towards the house where Mr Biddle was seen to be walking up and down the back veranda of the homestead and holding a knife. During this time he called out to Jennifer that he had just killed her mother. 

46The various children were summoned, as were the police and the ambulance services. Mr Biddle left the vicinity of the house and went out towards a back paddock. There he engaged in a stand off with police. He was in possession of a knife with which he was threatening to kill himself. The police attempted to persuade him to surrender. The stand off continued for many hours until at about 6.15am Mr Biddle was subdued and arrested. 

47I am satisfied, and so find, both from what Mr Biddle said to the police during the stand off and what police found when they entered the house, that Mr Biddle left the caravan, and then proceeded to an open-sided work shed on the property where he retrieved an iron bar that was ordinarily used as a handle to raise and lower a hydraulic jack. 

48He then walked from the shed to the homestead where his wife was. He first attempted to enter the front door, but then decided to go to the rear of the homestead and enter there quietly so as not to warn his wife of his presence. He came up behind her while she was standing in the lounge room and struck her on the head with the iron bar. It then appears that she moved slowly from the lounge room along the hallway to an area between two bedrooms where she slumped to the floor bleeding heavily. There, Mr Biddle subjected her to another five or six blows of significant force. She was entirely helpless, and in vain made attempts to shield her head from the blows. 

49I can only conclude from these events that Mr Biddle struck his wife intending to kill her. 

50Mrs Biddle's injuries were horrific. The blows fractured her skull in a number of places, caused significant lacerations to the top and side of her scalp and a very serious brain injury. 

51Mr Biddle has no memory of the offence or a period of approximately six hours following it. Mental health professionals who testified at trial attribute this to psychogenic amnesia or repressed memory, a quite common, or at least not uncommon, phenomenon in homicide cases. I accept this as the cause of his lack of memory, rather than Mr Biddle pretending conveniently that he does not remember what occurred. 

52The only source of evidence pertaining directly to Mr Biddle's motivation for the killing is obtained from the police recording of a two-hour portion of the standoff. In recalling the event to the police during that stand-off, Mr Biddle attributed his wrongful behaviour, of going 'off his brain' and killing Mrs Biddle, to a loss of temper. 

53He described the loss of temper as triggered by events subsequent to his wife's discovery of his affair, which centred on his disenfranchisement from the family and family home. This includes being forced to leave the family home, initially to Kundabung and later to a caravan on the property. Of more immediate history on the night, he described the verbal altercations between he and his wife and her direction to return to his caravan mentioned above, coupled with allegations of loud music being played by his wife to annoy him. 

54Mrs Biddle was taken to the Kempsey District Hospital by ambulance. She had very serious head injuries as a consequence of the blows struck by her husband. 

55She was transferred by air ambulance to the Royal North Shore Hospital. She did not ever recover consciousness and on the following day, 21 February 2009, her life support system was turned off and she died. 

Police Investigation 

56Mr Biddle was taken first to the Kempsey District Hospital where some minor wounds were attended to and dressed. He was then returned to the police station. 

57He declined to undergo any form of interview with police. 

58Mr Biddle has been in custody since 21 February 2009. 

Partial Defences 

59At trial, Mr Biddle pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the basis of either or both of the partial defences I discuss below. 

60At trial Mr Biddle submitted, on the evidence, that the jury would find that he was provoked and therefore guilty of manslaughter. However, consistent with the jury's verdict, I am satisfied that, provocation having been negatived beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown, Mr Biddle was not provoked into killing his wife. 

61Mr Biddle also submitted that the jury ought to find, on the balance of probabilities, in his favour the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. At issue at trial was whether substantial impairment to Mr Biddle's capacity to control himself existed, and if so, whether it was sufficient to reduce liability from murder to manslaughter. In finding the prisoner guilty of murder, the jury must have answered no to either the former or the latter, of these elements of the partial defence. 

62In order to make a finding on this issue, evidence of Mr Biddle's mental health history should be briefly reviewed. 

63In seeking to understand the effect of this evidence, it is important to bear in mind that Mr Biddle, through his senior counsel, did not seek to elevate the fact of his mental health issues too highly. He conceded to the jury, that at the time of the murder, Mr Biddle fully knew what he was doing and knew that it was wrong: T394. This concession was properly made. 

64Dr Hatton, a general practitioner with over 30 years' clinical experience, including many patients with mental health issues, gave evidence. He was Mr Biddle's general practitioner for more than 16 years. 

65He reported that Mr Biddle presented with neurological symptoms in May 1993, and was subsequently hospitalised and diagnosed with lymphocytic choriomeningitis, which included some features of encephalitis. 

66In June 2005, Mr Biddle reported symptoms of memory loss and irritability to Dr Hatton. Mr Biddle expressed concern as both his parents had been diagnosed with dementia in later life. Dr Hatton performed a mini mental state examination test, a relatively crude test, in which Mr Biddle scored 30 out of a possible 30. Results of blood tests and a brain CT scan reported no detectable abnormalities, and no further investigation was pursued. 

67On 14 January 2009, following a visit and a request from Mr Biddle, Dr Hatton completed a report to the Firearms Registry at the New South Wales Police. The report was required to enable an assessment of Mr Biddle's suitability to hold a firearms licence. This reassessment was in response to the attempted self-harm episode two weeks earlier. Dr Hatton did not suggest he was making a detailed psychiatric assessment, but concluded that Mr Biddle "" does not suffer from any psychiatric disorder ... [and Mr Biddle] does in my judgment have the ability to form a rational judgment or to exercise will power to control physical acts in accordance with rational judgment "". I accept this assessment of Dr Hatton. It is consistent with Mr Biddle's working capacity and ability at the time. 

68I also find it to be particularly persuasive because it is, in time, the closest opinion of a medical practitioner to the killing of Mrs Biddle. As well, it is entirely uninfluenced by any suggestion or hint of hindsight bias arising unconsciously in later opinions, because the killing had occurred. 

69It is also free of any of the effects on the character and mental state of Mr Biddle consequent upon the murder of Mrs Biddle, and the later, and increasing, effect of Mr Biddle being in custody. 

70I recognise that Dr Hatton is not a specialist psychiatrist, but he is not without a good deal of clinical and practical experience in patients suffering from mental health issues. 

71Further information about Mr Biddle comes from the various expert mental health professionals who examined him after the offence. The majority of these examinations occurred over one to two years later. The experts had different fields of speciality, and I will briefly summarise those parts of their evidence, which I accept. 

72Evidence of Mr Biddle's brain function was provided by Dr Pulman, a neuropsychologist. Mr Biddle was examined and tested two years after the offence. That testing placed him in the lowest first to fifth percentiles in five out of six separate areas of testing, which included verbal comprehension, working memory, processing speed and general ability index. He scored an extremely low full scale IQ of 69. Dr Pulman concluded that Mr Biddle was in the range of someone who was mildly intellectually impaired. 

73Dr Pulman said that the IQ score of 69, was less than she anticipated, having regard to her assessment of Mr Biddle's likely capacity to function before the murder. The other mental health experts broadly agreed with this assessment. The score stands in contrast to Mr Biddle's work history and his capacity to manage the farming activities that took place on the family property, albeit on a low scale. 

74I am satisfied that the most likely reason to explain the discrepancy between the anticipated, and the actual IQ score, is that the testing occurred at a time when, as a consequence of the offence, his continued incarceration, and the loss of regular contact with his family, Mr Biddle was suffering depression. Depression was, as I was told by Dr Pulman, one cause of low IQ scores on the tests undertaken by Dr Pulman. 

75Evidence of Mr Biddle's psychiatric state (his mind) was provided by Professor Greenberg, Dr Allnutt, Dr Nielssen and Dr Furst. All experts were in agreement that Mr Biddle suffered from an abnormality of mind, emanating from brain damage subsequent to meningoencephalitis in 1993, with concurrent depression. Two experts assessed the resulting impairment of capacity to control himself as substantial, one expert assessed it as mild and the remaining psychiatrist was not asked to make an assessment. 

76Expert evidence of any disease or injury of Mr Biddle's brain was provided by Dr Rosen, a neurologist. He concluded the prisoner suffered from a significant brain injury subsequent to meningoencephalitis. 

77Four letters written by Mr Biddle to his family after his arrest were admitted as evidence, and available to the above experts to assist in forming their conclusions, and also the jury. 

78It is appropriate to note that the word ""substantial"" in the partial defence carries its ordinary meaning of being of substance, and not trivial, slight or insignificant. It does not indicate that the impairment of mind must necessarily have of itself, overborne Mr Biddle's capacity to control himself. 

79On the basis of the entirety of the evidence regarding the prisoner's mental health status and nature of the offence, I find, consistently with the jury's verdict, that the prisoner's capacity to control himself was substantially impaired by brain damage subsequent to earlier meningoencephalitis, and concurrent depression. However, that impairment was not sufficient to warrant reducing his liability from murder to manslaughter, because I find that it played no causal role in the events which occurred. 

80In summary I reach the following factual conclusions: 

(a)As his counsel told the jury, Mr Biddle fully knew what he was doing to his wife, and fully knew that what he was doing was wrong; 

(b)Mr Biddle acted rationally and deliberately. He left his accommodation, went to collect the murder weapon, an iron bar, surreptitiously entered the homestead by a rear door, surprised his wife and bludgeoned her to death, in a most vicious attack; 

(c)Mrs Biddle, was aware of what was happening, tried to defend herself, but was helpless to do so as the attack persisted; 

(d)At the time of the attack, Mr Biddle was not provoked. However, the breakdown of his marriage, for which his conduct had been the precipitatory cause, together with his inability to accept that his wife was entitled to an independent life and the fact that he could not reside in the homestead, all combined to bring him to decide to kill his wife; 

(e)The killing of Mrs Biddle was the product of his selfish, perhaps narcissistic, personality, his determination to have control over his wife's behaviour and the way in which his family lived their lives. 

Simply put, he was jealous of his wife, and her newly found independence. He could not accept that his previously comfortable life had irretrievably changed. He felt threatened by the loss of his dominant position in the family. 

(f)It is clear that he lost proper control of his behaviour, and attacked his wife, intending to kill her and succeeded in so doing. 

Specific Statutory Considerations 

81Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act identifies a number of matters as aggravating factors to which regard must be had in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. The first which is relevant to this matter is that the offence involved the actual use of violence: see s 21A(2)(b). However, given the nature of the crime, I am satisfied that this aggravating factor is accounted for as being an element of the offence and that I should not have additional regard to it. 

82The second aggravating factor applicable to this case is that Mr Biddle actually used a weapon, namely, the iron bar. The iron bar was, I am satisfied, a substantial weapon the use of which would obviously have been likely to cause death or serious injury to his wife. That is an aggravating factor to which I have regard: s 21A(2)(c). 

83A further aggravating factor was that the offence was committed in Mrs Biddle's home. This is an aggravating factor because all people are entitled to feel safe in their home and safe from being attacked in their home: see s 21A(2)(eb). I am satisfied that Mrs Biddle was feeling safe. Her home was not locked. It was an aggravating feature of Mr Biddle's conduct that he chose to commit it in Mrs Biddle's home where she was entitled to feel safe. 

84Other aggravating factors include that the injury caused by the offence was substantial: s 21A(2)(g). But given the nature of the offence, and the elements of it, this is not a matter to which I ought have additional regard. 

85There are a number of mitigating factors to which I am required to have regard, and to which I do. They are: 

(a)That the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(3)(b). Although the offence had a degree of planning about it, it was not, I am satisfied, part of any planned or organised criminal activity. This has some small mitigatory effect. 

(b)That the offender was provoked by the victim: s 21A(3)(c). Although the jury has rejected provocation as a partial defence in the proceedings, the conduct upon which Mr Biddle relied may nevertheless be taken into account in mitigation of any penalty which is to be imposed. But the conduct here relied upon, being the interaction between Mr Biddle and his wife about the state of their marriage, and domestic arrangements falls within the description ""... relationship tension and general enmity ... leading up to the offence "" as this phrase is used in Shaw v R [2008] NSWCCA 58 at [26]. Whilst I have regard to it, it carries little weight in terms of mitigation in this case. Mr Biddle's senior counsel accepted in the course of his sentencing submission, that provocation was not available to ameliorate Mr Biddle's conduct (T43.9, 10 October 2011). 

(c)That the offender had no prior criminal convictions and was a person of good character are matters of mitigation: ss 21A(3)(e) and 21A(3)(f). Here the Crown accepted that there were no prior convictions and the evidence in the trial was that Mr Biddle was not the subject of any complaint to, and report to, the police. I am prepared to accept that he was a man of prior good character. I take this mitigating factor into account. 

(d)Mr Biddle's prospect of rehabilitation and likelihood of re-offending: s 21A(3)(g) and s 21A(3)(h). Having regard to all of the circumstances, and in particular Mr Biddle's age and maturity, I am satisfied that it is unlikely that he will re-offend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. 

(e)Remorse: where an offender has shown remorse that can mitigate any sentence: s 21A(3)(i). I am not satisfied that Mr Biddle has shown any true remorse. I accept that he has acknowledged, during the court process, his actions in killing his wife. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter when first arraigned in this Court. I note that he first offered to plead guilty to manslaughter at the time he was committed by the Local Court. The Court has had the benefit of what he told the police during the stand-off on the morning of his arrest and the benefit of a number of letters which he has written whilst in custody. As well, the Court has the histories which have been provided by Mr Biddle to the various medical professionals who gave evidence. 


The totality of that evidence reveals to me a man who feels very sorry for himself and his current predicament, a man who admits he made a "" mistake "" in killing his wife, but who seems to continue to advance excuses, largely about his wife's conduct towards him, which do not persuade me that he shows any true remorse for what he has done, nor that he readily accepts any moral responsibility for what he has done. 

In his evidence on sentence, Mr Biddle said (T9.26, 10 October 2011): 

""... I have always said that I'm sorry. ... I cannot express my remorse enough to all sides of the family. I am sorry. I have put in my letters I have posted to my children but they should, I think be able to verify that. That I have always said [sorry] and I have wrote how I felt."" 

The letters, in evidence written by Mr Biddle to his children, did not support this evidence. A careful reading of them does not suggest to me the expression of any remorse at all, let alone any genuine remorse. 

I note the evidence of Mr Biddle's sister, Ms Steinmetz, that Mr Biddle had told her that he was sorry and I also note her lay opinion that "" ... he is sorry for what he has done ..."" (T18.13, 10 October 2011). 

However, having regard to all of her evidence, and the totality of the evidence on this issue, I remain unpersuaded that Mr Biddle has shown any genuine remorse. 

(f)The degree of pre-trial direction by the defence: s 21A(3)(a). There is no reason, in this case, to regard the conduct of Mr Biddle prior to trial, and during it, as meriting any lesser sentence because he has facilitated the administration of justice. 

Objective Seriousness of the Offence 

86It is appropriate to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence of Mr Biddle. This is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to Mr Biddle and is to be assessed wholly by reference to the nature of the offending: Muldrock at [27]. 

87I proceed to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence (although at least arguably since Muldrock this is not necessary) because: 

(a)The standard non-parole period is a legislative guidepost which is of importance as a factor in sentencing: Muldrock at [27]; 

(b)In order to give effect to that guidepost, or at least, to understand its significance in the process of determining a sentence for an individual, there needs to be a point of comparison with the legislative discretion, namely, whether the offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the offences generally: s 54A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ; and 

(c)It is difficult to comply with specific statutory requirements in s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act of providing reasons for varying from the standard non-parole period, unless there has been a determination of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence. 

88In making this assessment, and concordant with my understanding of Muldrock , I will not take into account the facts and circumstances relating to Mr Biddle's mental health, which I am persuaded amounted, within the meaning of the legislation, to "" a substantial impairment by reason of abnormality of mind "". 

89I should add for abundant clarity, that as I have said above at [79], I would not have been satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that this substantial impairment was in any way causally connected to his conduct on the evening of 20 February 2009. 

90In my assessment, the criminality was serious. The offence was the subject of some thought, albeit over a relatively short period of time. A weapon was identified, collected and taken to the homestead to be used. Entry was gained in a way to conceal his approach. Mr Biddle's actions were perpetrated on an innocent, unknowing and defenceless woman in her own home. She was a woman who had not done anything which warranted criticism, let alone the brutal attack to which she was subjected. 

91As well, she tried to escape, was pursued and then bludgeoned whilst she lay helpless on the ground. Mr Biddle attacked Mrs Biddle, intending to kill her. 

92I would assess the objective seriousness as being above the middle of the range. 

Victim Impact Statement 

93The Court has heard statements read by or on behalf of each of Mr Biddle's four children, Jennifer, Jody, Natasha and Dean. Mrs Judy Byrnes read a statement. She is Mrs Biddle's sister and was obviously very close to her. 

94As well, Mrs Lyn Steinmetz, the sister of Mr Biddle, who was a close friend of Mrs Biddle from their school days, gave evidence of her feelings of hurt, anger and bereavement. 

95Clearly this crime has touched the members of both Mr and Mrs Biddle's immediate and extended family, and affected them all deeply. 

96I will have such regard to this evidence as the law permits: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; s 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

Subjective Circumstances of Mr Biddle 

97Mr Biddle is now 63 years old. He was nearly 61 years old when he murdered his wife. 

98Mr Biddle had a stable home life. He left school at about 14 years old and then worked with his father for many years in a variety of trades, all of which centred upon motor vehicles and motor mechanics. 

99In about 1993 and 1994, he ceased working for his father and struck out on his own. 

100As I have earlier mentioned, he had an episode of viral meningitis in 1993, after which he worked, away from home, in a number of different manual jobs for about 2 years. He then returned to the Kempsey area and commenced work at the West Kempsey Service Station until his arrest. 

101In 2005, he consulted Dr Hatton because he was concerned that he may have been suffering from the early signs of dementia. Dr Hatton undertook a range of investigations and was unable to establish that he had any diagnosable condition. 

102Until he engaged in his extra-marital affair, he had been happily married to Christine for approximately 41 years. They had a family of four children and many grandchildren. He said that until February 2009, he had a wonderful life, although it was not without its ups and downs. He described his late wife as the ""... best in the world . "" 

103In all respects, he was a man of good character. 

104He was obviously proud of his family and work successes. He was the proprietor of the service station and as well, he undertook some farming activities, including cattle raising, on the family property. He described what he had developed as "" ... an empire ..."". 

105As I have said, with this background, and having regard to the facts and circumstances of what occurred, he is unlikely to offend again and has good prospects of rehabilitation. 

Sentence 

106In considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr Biddle, I commence with the reminder that murder involves the criminal taking of a human life. It is a violation of the sanctity of human life, which is a concept at the heart of a civilised community. 

107Ordinarily, a conviction for murder warrants a substantial sentence because the demands of punishment and the deterrence of the broader community against similar conduct are of gross importance. 

108Here, I am satisfied that I should make a finding of special circumstances as the law permits: s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . The special circumstances arise here because of Mr Biddle's age, the present state of his mental health, including possible early signs of dementia, the fact that this is his first episode of imprisonment and his good prospects of rehabilitation. The Crown agreed that special circumstances were established. As a result, the period which will be spent in custody will be such as to enable adequate rehabilitation and supervision upon release. 

109I have discussed all of the facts which are relevant to this decision and now it is necessary to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence. 

110I determine the appropriate sentence be one of 27 years imprisonment, of which Mr Biddle must spend 18 years in gaol before being eligible for parole. 

111It is necessary for me to make a record of my reasons for imposing a non-parole period which is shorter than the standard non-parole period: s 54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act . The foregoing reasons contain all of the factors that I have taken into account. I have relied upon all of those factors in making an evaluative judgment as to the appropriate sentence. 

Orders 

112Mr Biddle, I sentence you to the following term of imprisonment: 

(a)A non-parole period of 18 years commencing on 21 February 2009 and finishing on 20 February 2027. 

(b)A balance of term of nine years commencing on 21 February 2027 and finishing on 20 February 2036. 

(c)The first day upon which you will be eligible to be released is 20 February 2027.

2709026,"Abdel-Hady (""SA"") v R [2011] NSWCCA 196","Judgment 

Introduction 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Adams and Fullerton JJ. 

2ADAMS and FULLERTON JJ : The appellant was convicted on 19 February 2009 of two counts, each in respect of a different complainant (AW and MD) but committed on the same occasion, of causing another to take a stupefying drug with attempt to commit an indictable offence, contrary to s 38 of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of indecent assault on AW contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act . On the first count the appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 19 November 2009 with a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months, on the second count to imprisonment for a fixed term of 5 years commencing 19 May 2009 and on the third count to imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months commencing 19 February 2009. 

3Very briefly, the Crown case was that the appellant, having invited the complainants to his apartment after they had been out drinking together, gave them some zolpidem (sold as Stilnox) in a drink he mixed for them and, while AW was semiconscious and MD was asleep in another bedroom, placed his hand down AW's underpants and touched her vagina. 

4The appellant appeals from his convictions on the following grounds: 
1. The learned trial judge's summing up to the jury gave rise to a miscarriage of justice in that he failed to present a balanced account of the conflicting cases. 

2. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury to consider each of the three counts on the indictment separately. 

3. The trial judge erred in failing to give a direction in accordance with R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290 when requested to do so by defence counsel. 

5The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence but, having regard to the view we have formed as to the appeal against conviction, it is not necessary to consider this question. 

Particulars of the offences 

6Before dealing with the evidence, having regard to certain matters argued in support of grounds 2 and 3, it is convenient to set out the way in which the prosecution particularised the offences. 

7After briefly setting out the events up to the alleged administration of the stupefying drug the Crown opened as follows: 
It is alleged by the Crown that the intention of the accused, in mixing the stupefying drug into the drinks, was to enable himself to indecently assault [AW]. 

... so it is alleged that the accused committed the first two crimes in the indictment ... with the guilty intention that I have mentioned and once that happened those two crimes were complete, whatever happened later. 

8The Crown then briefly described what he called the ""third crime in the indictment"", namely the indecent assault, describing it as occurring when the appellant ""put his hand on [AW's] vagina and stroked it or made some such movement"". He briefly set out the alleged ensuing events and, when he had completed that account and referred to the evidence he expected to adduce from Dr Perl, completed his opening in the following way: 
... I think you've had the charges read out to you a number of times and I will just conclude my address by reminding you about the charges. The first charge is that the accused unlawfully caused [MD] to take a stupefying drug with the intent to enable himself to commit an indictable offence, namely to indecently assault [ AW]. 

The second charge is in similar terms in relation to causing [AW] to take a stupefying drug. Just looking at those two charges which relate in effect to spiking the drinks, you'll see immediately that there are at least two ingredients or elements in those charges. The first element is that the accused caused the person to take the stupefying drug. That would be the physical action of mixing the drug in with the drink when the accused was in the kitchen with the cocktail shaker. Another element of the offence concerns the mind of the accused. It's not just the action in mixing the drug in with the drink, there was a purpose or intention behind that, and the element or ingredients of the offence relates to the intention of the accused when he did what he did, if you find that to have been what he did, and that was an intention to enable himself to indecently assault [AW] . 

In order to achieve that objective the accused, of course, had to cause the resistance or consciousness of not only [AW] but also her boyfriend to be overcome. The third crime may be conveniently called indecent assault and that was the act of the accused touching the vagina of the complainant, [AW] in the way that he did. That was an assault. It was an indecent assault. 
(emphasis added) 

9Of course it was theoretically possible that, on the assumption that the appellant administered the drug, he would have been liable to conviction if he had the intention to commit any indictable offence, not necessarily one that had a sexual component or AW as the victim. Proof that the appellant had spiked the complainants' drinks certainly strongly supported the inference that he contemplated some serious wrongdoing (in all likelihood amounting to an indictable offence), however it was necessary that specific intent be specified in the indictment so that the accused knew the case alleged against him. 

10Here, the allegation was that the appellant intended to indecently assault AW. While the mode of that assault need not have been specified, the only evidence of intent relied on by the Crown was the indecent assault allegedly committed on AW when the appellant put his hand down her pants. If the jury were satisfied that the appellant committed that particular indecent assault, then it would have been open to infer that he spiked the drinks intending to commit an indecent assault on AW, even though it might be that he had not at that time intended to commit that particular indecent assault on her. However, in the absence of proof that the appellant committed the indecent assault on AW which was, the subject of the third count there being no other material relied on or pointed to by the Crown, the jury could not conclude that he intended to commit the indictable offence particularised by the prosecution in counts 1 and 2 on the indictment (namely the indecent assault of AW), even accepting that he had spiked the complainants' drinks. Accordingly, in order to prove the appellant's guilt of the first and second counts, the prosecution confined its case in respect of the element of intention to that which had been evidenced by the indecent assault alleged in the third count. Furthermore, since it was a vital step in reasoning to a conclusion as to the mental element alleged in the first and second counts, the indecent assault had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, in the circumstances of this case, all three counts on the indictment were inextricably linked necessitating careful directions from the trial judge. 

11This argument was not put quite in this form by Mr Brady, counsel for the appellant, at trial but it was implicit in his address to the jury and in his application for redirections. In this Court, however, it follows from the way in which grounds 2 and 3 were argued that the connection between the three counts is as we have identified. It is mentioned at this point as explaining why we have focussed on particular parts of the summing up in the discussion which follows. It will be considered in detail later (see [59] - [62] and [125] - [133]). 

The evidence 

12AW and her boyfriend MD, who was a trader in the financial market, came to Sydney in late 2006 on a working holiday and stayed with friends. On 29 November 2006 they met three friends at a bar and shared two bottles of wine over the course of about an hour. At about 7.30pm the group left the bar and went to a restaurant nearby where they were joined by other friends. Over the next three hours they ate a three-course meal and had more alcohol to drink. After dinner AW and MD, with three of their friends, returned to the bar where they had commenced to drink earlier in the evening. One of the friends left soon after and AW, MD and the remaining two friends, Shane McNally and Leila Marcos, remained until closing time, drinking. They then went to another bar where AW and MD struck up a conversation with the appellant. The appellant purchased a bottle of champagne and returned with three glasses as well as drinks for MD and himself. They continued their conversation. The appellant purchased a second bottle of champagne for the group and, when Ms Marcos and Mr McNally left at about 2.30am, a third bottle. In cross-examination AW agreed that the appellant had introduced himself, had told them where he worked and where he lived and had given MD his mobile number. 

13The appellant invited the complainants back to his apartment for a drink and to look at the view. This was at about 3.00am. (There was some disagreement in the evidence as to when and to whom the invitation was made but this does not matter for present purposes.) At about 4.00am AW and MD decided it was time to leave and the appellant pressed them to go back to his apartment for a drink. AW's level of intoxication was relatively high at about this time but she said that ""I had all my wits about me"" and claimed her speech, movements and memory were unimpaired. She denied that she had consumed any drugs to that point. 

14The complainants and the appellant caught a taxi to the latter's apartment in Mosman. In the taxi, AW agreed with MD that they would go for an hour, have a drink, and then go home. She said that when they got to the apartment it was just starting to get light. They walked through the kitchen and sat at a table on the balcony. The appellant was in the kitchen making them a drink and AW saw him using a cocktail shaker. This took some time and AW asked, ""what are you doing in there?"". She thought it was just short of ten minutes before he brought the drinks out. When the appellant returned to the balcony with their drinks and some candles they continued to speak about business. On sipping her drink, AW commented on how strong it was, as did MD. She said she did not feel any particular effect from the drink. She thought that there was approximately 250ml of liquid and that it was a vodka-based drink tasting of lemon. She said she did not drink all of hers. She said the appellant drank a brown spirit in a brandy balloon glass. AW only recalled MD having one drink at the apartment. In cross-examination AW denied that she had more than one drink at the apartment, that MD had started mixing drinks, that she had looked in the refrigerator or had poured herself a drink (as had been alleged by the appellant in his interview with police). She agreed that she had looked at the refrigerator because of its design. 

15The complainants said that, some ten minutes into their conversation, the appellant left the balcony and returned a few minutes later with a white dinner plate containing white powder, which he cut into lines. (The appellant denied providing any cocaine.) This was done without any prior conversation about drugs; AW and MD simply assumed that the powder was cocaine, which they had taken on prior occasions. Each snorted four or five lines over a period of ten minutes. In cross-examination she estimated the cocaine on the plate was between one and two grams. She denied ingesting cocaine earlier that night. 

16The sun started to rise whilst they were talking on the balcony at which time AW's recollection of events became hazy. She recalled that they were smoking cigarettes and, at the appellant's suggestion, they looked through the apartment. There was a discussion about the appellant having a Maserati and the appellant looking for keys as he and MD were going to go out and get cigarettes (but this did not, in the result, occur). At this time AW recalled feeling more intoxicated than she expected; she said she ""wasn't feeling myself, I wasn't feeling very good at all ... confused and uncertain of what was actually going on"". She said that she felt drugged, affected by something other than alcohol and cocaine, the effects of which she was familiar with. She said that cocaine made her more alert, assertive, sometimes bossy, clear of mind, in control of herself and talkative but on this occasion she felt that she did not have her wits about her, things had become hazy and she felt a sense of confusion as they moved around the apartment. 

17During the tour of the apartment, AW took photographs and agreed that in one of them MD could be seen holding a dark coloured drink. She stated that she did not see MD helping himself to drinks and that as far as she was aware he had only drunk the lemon coloured drink the appellant gave them. There was a 48 minute time lapse between the first and last photograph. 

18AW recalled calling her friend Catriona Gilchrist in Melbourne to tell her that they were having a great time and were in a great house overlooking the heads at Balmoral. Telephone records showed that this call took place at about 7.00am. Ms Gilchrist and Jacqueline Mahoney gave evidence that they took AW's call on the speaker of their mobile phone. AW told them she had been out to dinner with friends, that they had met a guy and had gone back to a ""fantastic pad"", and talked about the view and how beautiful it all was. Ms Gilchrist said that AW sounded elated, a bit repetitive, but seemed to be having fun. Her speech was slightly slurred. Ms Gilchrist asked AW where MD was and she replied that he had gone to get cigarettes. She then heard MD's voice in the background as well as that of another man and AW ask why they had been gone so long and MD say that they could not find the keys. AW said that she had taken some cocaine. Ms Mahoney said that she had never heard AW sounding so intoxicated before, that AW could ""drink her under the table"" and could certainly hold her alcohol. She had also heard her slur her words when intoxicated. 

19The telephone records also indicated that AW sent Ms Gilchrist a text message at 7.18am, ""I cannot concentrate xx"". AW said she did not recall sending that message until Ms Gilchrist brought it to her attention the following day. At about 7.45am Ms Gilchrist read the text message from AW and replied in text ""are you still awake sistaw [sic]"", to which she did not receive a response. 

20AW's next recollection was of being in the appellant's bedroom, getting into his bed with MD and thinking that it was quite strange but that she did not have the ability ""to stop it or question it or change the situation"". She was aware that MD was on one side of her and the appellant on the other moving his body against her. (In cross-examination AW said that she remembered feeling some contact with the appellant behind her but the recollection that he had been moving against her (""gyrating"") may have resulted from a conversation she had with MD and was something that she had ""pieced together afterwards"".) She was under the covers, clothed, apart from shoes. She recollected MD ""yelling at me almost"", shaking her and saying, ""... Is he fucking you, is he fucking you? and I just went 'no' and I didn't really know what was going on and that's the last of my memory for that period"". 

21AW said that the next thing that she remembered was stirring, her eyes closed, feeling a hand beneath her underwear touching her on her vagina with a ""gentle stroking action"" for just a few seconds. Her eyes were closed and it took some seconds before she realised she was not in her own bedroom. The appellant was lying on his side facing her with his right hand down her underwear. She jumped out of the bed, asked where MD was and ran out of the room. AW ran down a few steps, saw a door open and MD lying in a bed in his underwear partly covered by a doona. She tried to shake him awake. A few seconds later the appellant came into the room, stood her up and guided her around to the other side of the bed. He lifted up the doona and guided her into the bed. 

22Having covered the couple with the doona, the appellant lay down on the floor beside her and held her hand. Trying not to alert the appellant to what she was doing, AW squeezed MD hard until he opened his eyes. She then mouthed ""help"" and that they had been drugged. This occurred several times until MD apparently registered what she was telling him. 

23AW said that she felt ""delirious"" at this point and did not feel safe. She said they sat up and the appellant got up and walked out of the room without saying anything. AW told MD that she believed that they had been drugged and that she had woken up in the appellant's bed with his hand down her pants. She then walked out of the room and, seeing the appellant sitting on the couch with his laptop, went over to him and asked what he was doing. In the meantime, MD looked for his clothes, found his jeans in the bedroom and came out looking for his shirt. AW commented to MD that it was 10.20am and that the market was open, because normally he would be sitting in front of his computer at 9.50am ready for the market to open. MD then made a call to his trading desk. She then told the appellant to order them a taxi. She said that when MD entered the lounge area he said to the appellant, ""What the hell has gone on here in the last three hours ... you spoke about trust and friendship?"" (a matter which she had omitted in her statement to police). 

24At some stage, when MD was not in the room, AW said the appellant asked for her telephone number which she gave to him although she said she did not know why. Shortly after that she heard the taxi's horn and the couple left. The appellant did not go down with them. In cross-examination AW denied (the appellant's claim) that she or MD had thanked the appellant and told him that he could stay with them if he was ever in Melbourne. 

25AW stated that she had no recollection of events from some time after 7.00am when she spoke with Ms Gilchrist and shortly after 10.00am when she woke up in the appellant's bed. 

26AW said that in the taxi she still felt groggy and had never felt that way before. She became upset and spoke with MD trying to piece together what had happened after they had the drink given to them by the appellant. They directed the driver to take them to the hospital, where they were examined. They gave Dr Brennan an account of events, and provided urine and blood samples for testing. Both AW and MD told Dr Brennan that each had consumed 15 to 18 standard drinks. AW denied that she and MD had talked about what they would tell the doctor. Dr Brennan considered that AW's and MD's symptoms were consistent with the ingestion of a behaviour altering substance during the morning of the day of presentation. 

27The complainants went from the hospital to the Police Station and reported the incident. They were tired and emotionally drained. After speaking to police briefly, they were told to come back the following day to provide formal statements. AW also believed that she had told police that she had felt the appellant's hand stroking her vagina and was unable to explain why this did not appear in the police officer's notes. 

28As to previous drug use, AW said that she had previously used Stilnox in 2002 while travelling to enable her to sleep on long bus trips but she had never taken it in combination with any other substance. She agreed that she had used cocaine recreationally in the past as well as ecstasy and speed but had not injected speed. She denied ever having used a sedative to come off cocaine, although she had used sedatives to come off speed some years before. She denied ever using Stilnox to come off speed, ecstasy or cocaine. She agreed that later in the evening on 30 November 2006 and on the following day she and MD had spoken to their friends about what had happened. She denied that she and MD were ""trying to work through what had happened"" and had ""tried to fill in the gaps"". She denied that she and MD had discussed how much the appellant was worth and how they might be able to get money from him. AW denied having sent a text message to the appellant at any time and denied any knowledge of that having occurred. 

29Broadly speaking, MD's evidence was similar to that of AW and it is not necessary to repeat those matters. MD gave some additional details which are not presently important. 

30He agreed in cross-examination that he was drunk when they left the bar to go to the appellant's apartment. He denied in cross-examination mixing any drinks at the appellant's apartment and said he did not help himself to any drinks. The only drink he had was the one given to him by the appellant. He said that, after taking the cocaine, they continued chatting on the balcony for the next hour to hour and a half and at some stage moved into the apartment where there was a conversation about cars. They went back onto the balcony to smoke a cigarette and he noticed for the first time that he had double vision, which he had never experienced before. He went inside. There was a discussion about going to get cigarettes. The appellant could not find his house keys so they did not go out. 

31From that point MD's recollection was affected and he felt ""woozy"". He noticed that AW was taking photographs, he recalled making a telephone call and the appellant showing them the apartment. They ended up in the main bedroom where the appellant guided them to the bed. MD thought that what they were doing was strange. AW got under the covers and he was on the edge of the bed. The appellant also got into the bed under the covers behind AW. He saw a thrusting motion under the covers and asked AW whether the appellant was trying ""to fuck"" her. She told him that she was fine. He recalled lifting up the covers and seeing the appellant's hand on AW's bottom over her dress. MD then got up and went out onto the balcony, still feeling very ""woozy"". The appellant came out, put his arm around his shoulder and led him back inside. At this point MD said his ""recollection turns off like a switch""; he felt like an observer. He said he was not in a normal state of mind because under the circumstances he would have grabbed AW and left. 

32MD next recalled waking up in bed with AW beside him squeezing him hard and mouthing ""help"" and ""we've been drugged"". He noticed the appellant beside the bed. MD sat up and the appellant left the room. AW then told him that she had woken up and the appellant's hands were down her pants. MD was only in his underwear, his jeans beside the bed. He put them on and found his shirt crumpled on the kitchen bench. He had no recollection of removing his clothes. Around that time AW told him it was 10.20am. He made a call to his broker. He could not remember his trading positions, which had not happened before. The broking firm recorded calls received from MD at 10.44am, 11.32am and 11.50am. There was a call from the firm to MD at 11.52am and a final call at 1.49pm. The witnesses MD spoke to noted that he sounded slightly incoherent, vague and had forgotten simple things like his client number. In cross-examination, MD agreed that when he spoke to a colleague at 11.00am on 1 December 2006, he had talked about the appellant as having ""a $6 million pad"" and that he was a high net worth individual. When it was suggested to him that he should ""try to get some cash out of him"" and that ""he would probably want to hush it up"", MD replied ""exactly"". However, MD denied sending a text to the appellant wanting to get some cash out of him and stated that he had not had any contact with the appellant since the incident. In cross-examination MD denied that he offered the appellant to stay with them if he came to Melbourne. 

33MD said that he was aware that during the committal proceedings the appellant had alleged that they had sent him a text message but MD asserted that he did not do so and that he had not given the appellant's number to anyone but the police. MD disagreed in cross-examination that he needed to take something after ingesting the cocaine to help him come down so that he could sleep before trading on the financial market at 10.00am. He agreed that he had used cocaine in the past as well as speed in his twenties. He said that he had never taken a sedative to come off a high. 

34The taxi driver received a job at 10.45am to pick up two people from Balmoral and take them to Bondi. When he arrived he sounded the horn and waited until two passengers came out. During the trip he noticed that the female was crying. At one point the male asked him to stop somewhere so that they could buy some water. As they were approaching Edgecliff the passengers asked him to take them to St Vincent's Hospital. 

35In the taxi, MD noted down the appellant's address as well as the taxi driver's details on a receipt, which was exhibited. He and AW discussed what had happened and decided to go to the hospital to be examined as he was concerned that they had both been molested and drugged. MD had diarrhoea for almost a week, which was not a common occurrence for him. While they were waiting to be seen at the hospital, he felt nauseous and he had trouble standing and walking. MD said in cross-examination that he could not recall what he had told Dr Brennan about what had happened. He did not believe that he and AW had discussed what they would say to Dr Brennan although he agreed that he had told Dr Brennan that he had consumed 15 to 18 drinks and two lines of cocaine. He denied knowing that AW had provided the same information. He agreed that he had told police (on the following day, when his mind was clearer) that he had consumed three to four lines of cocaine. He stated that he did not know that AW had said the same. 

36Detectives O'Neil and Munroe spoke to the complainants at about 5.30pm on 30 November 2006. In brief, their presentation was consistent with their accounts of what happened, which were only brief as they were not fit to make formal statements. MD spoke slowly and some of his speech was slurred and at times incoherent, at times he stared and said nothing. He appeared affected by alcohol and/or another drug. Detective O'Neil observed that AW had red glassy eyes and was visibly upset and cried a number of times. AW told Detective Munroe that she believed that she had been drugged and sexually assaulted. Munroe noted that both AW and MD appeared extremely tired and pale, AW shaking and MD distracted and unwell. 

37There were some inconsistencies between the statements to police and the evidence but they are not significant for present purposes. MD agreed that he and AW had discussed what had occurred and in effect went through what each of them remembered. He denied that they were ""putting together what had happened"". 

38In cross-examination MD had stated that he had once taken a sedative to enable him to sleep on a plane but had not previously taken Stilnox. MD said that the only drink he consumed at the apartment was that mixed by the appellant and, although he was holding a brown drink in his hand as shown in the photograph taken by AW, that was not the drink that the appellant had made for him. 

39The friends with whom the complainants were socialising before going to the appellant's apartment also gave evidence. Mr McNally said he had not seen either AW or MD consume drugs on the evening they had gone out and did not believe they were drunk when he left them. Ms Marcos also stated that she had not seen either AW or MD consume drugs. 

40Pursuant to a search warrant obtained on 1 December 2006, Detective Munroe and other police officers attended the appellant's apartment. They arrested the appellant and took him to the police station. Once the appellant's solicitor arrived, he was taken back to the apartment where a search warrant was executed. The appellant was co-operative throughout. The apartment appeared neat and well kept. A number of prescription drugs were found in the apartment including two packets of Stilnox in the bedside drawer of his bedroom. One packet was seized. Four out of the ten tablets it contained were missing. The prescription for the drug was sighted. When asked what the Stilnox was for, the appellant replied that it was for his pinched nerve. Some acupuncture needles were found but not seized. No cocaine or evidence of its use was found, nor was a cocktail shaker located or seized. The appellant was later interviewed by police and in substance denied giving the complainants any drink spiked with drugs, or cocaine or having indecently assaulted them. 

41Blood samples taken from AW at 3.30pm and MD at 4.00pm on 30 November 2006 contained 0.04g of alcohol per100ml (AW) and 0.02g (MD) of alcohol per 100ml. These readings implied concentrations of alcohol at 7.30am of between 0.10 and 0.22 for MD with a most likely reading of 0.14 and between 0.114 and 0.234 for AW with a most likely reading of 0.154. These are very high readings. Zolpidem and cocaine metabolite were also detected. No DNA was detected on the swabs taken from AW's face and breasts and no semen was found in the swabs from different parts of the complainants' bodies or from their clothing. 

The evidence of Dr Perl 

42Evidence was given by Dr Perl, a clinical and behavioural pharmacologist, as to the effects of alcohol, cocaine and zolpidem. In substance, her analysis showed that a social drinker with the complainants' alcohol readings would experience impaired cognitive and motor function, unsteadiness, slow or slurred speech, increased clumsiness or poor co-ordination, mood changes, feelings of sedation or drowsiness and impairment of social inhibitions. The effects might well be more significant. Such a drinker might or might not experience impaired memory. She said that cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant which produces feelings of euphoria with higher doses frequently causing paranoia, hallucinations and a depressed mood. The consumption of three or four lines of cocaine was considered moderate, with that drug reaching peak effect about 30 minutes after ingestion. It would have slightly moderated the alcohol's depressant effects and resulted in slightly more wakefulness and alertness. Zolpidem is used to treat insomnia. It is a central nervous system depressant and could affect decision making ability, reaction skills and cause confusion. It also impacts on memory and could result in patchy memory storage. It is designed to have a very rapid onset, of between 15 to 30 minutes with its sleep inducing effects lasting about five hours. 

43In the context of further questions about degrees of impairment following the ingestion of zolpidem the following evidence was given by Dr Perl: 
Q. What appears when zolpidem is not taken by itself, but is taken with various other drugs or alcohol? 
A. Well, obviously the effects of impairment are enhanced as long as the effects of the zolpidem persist, but then other central nervous system depressants that could be taken with it may have longer lasting effects. So you can still have impairment at a later time which some patients attribute to the zolpidem, but it could be related to the other medication, or other recreational drugs such as alcohol. 

Q. With Stilnox, which is the trade name for zolpidem, are you aware as to whether or not it's medically recommended not to take alcohol with that? 
A. It is. It advises not to take alcohol with it, very strongly advises not take alcohol with it. 

Q. Are you able to say whether or not that advice would appear on a prescription? 
A. It - yes, it would because most pharmacists will put the warning label on zolpidem even though - and I'll just check, but I'm pretty sure that it's not actually a legal requirement. With most central nervous system depressant drugs, there is a legal requirement to put a warning label which advises about possible impairment of driving ability or operation of machinery and interaction with alcohol. Because zolpidem is intended for use at bedtime, they don't expect you to be driving or operating machinery and, therefore, the - initially I'm pretty sure that the warning wasn't required, but I think they may have changed that now."" 

Q. Can you just look that up now? 
A. Yes I shall. Yes, it does require a warning. 

44Dr Perl was then asked about the effects of taking Stilnox with alcohol: 
Q. Where Stilnox is taken with alcohol, what is the effect or what is the result, firstly, in terms of does it change the normal effects of alcohol taken alone and does it change the normal effects of Stilnox taken alone? 
A. Right. There are two issues here: one is the effect; and the other is the concentration of the drug or the alcohol. Stilnox and alcohol do not interact metabolically. So that means that Stilnox will not increase the blood alcohol concentration or reduce it in any way and vice versa. So there is no difference in the absorption elimination process of the drugs. 

The - in terms of the effects, they're both depressant drugs, so they both depress the brain functions. They both have sedating properties, so if they're taken together you would expect, at the least, an additive effect. I am not aware of any studies that have looked very closely as to whether or not there is more than an additive effect, so you'd expect a greater degree of drowsiness, sedation, sleepiness, when both are used. 

45Dr Perl was asked about the likely effects on the complainants on the Crown case theory, namely that they ingested Stilnox with alcohol at about 5.30am or so after having consumed significant quantities of alcohol before that time: 
Q. In those circumstances, assuming that level of intoxication at that time, and then the ingestion of the Stilnox in quantities that I've asked you to assume, what effect, in your view, could be expected on each of the complainants? What effect of drinking that drink would you expect, that drink containing Stilnox? 
A. I'd expect there to be very significant sedative or sedation of those people and, in all probability, the Stilnox would result in deep sleep, combined with that alcohol. 

Q. Can you just add into the equation the consumption of cocaine, so assume they had sniffed three or four lines of cocaine 10 or 15 minutes after they commenced drinking their drink. Put that into the equation and indicate what, in those circumstances, you would expect to happen? 
A. Well, cocaine's very short acting and, therefore, by 7.30 I wouldn't expect the cocaine to have had much of an effect at all given the blood alcohol level and the more or less peak effect of the Stilnox still occurring around that 7 - or it would have peaked around 7, 6.30/7. So the - it would still have been somewhere around its peak effect, so given the effect of alcohol and the Stilnox. I wouldn't expect the cocaine to have had very much effect at all. 

46Dr Perl was then taken to the solubility of Stilnox: 
Q. You then go on to describe zolpidem. What have you said about that? 
A. ""Zolpidem is a white to off-white colourless, crystalline substance which is soluble sparingly in water but more soluble in alcohol."" 

Q. What does that mean, that ""it is soluble sparingly in water but more soluble in alcohol""? 
A. That it's difficult to dissolve in just water, it is much easier to dissolve it in an alcohol based solution. 

Q. So do you see any difficulty physically for a person in mixing up a drink with a cocktail shaker to bring about a situation where one or two tablets of Stilnox is mixed up into the drink? 
A. No, I don't see any great difficulty. If there's alcohol contained in that it will dissolve most of the zolpidem and even if there is residue, then depending what else is in the cocktail shaker, if it's something that forms a cloudy solution or if there's ice in it, then any residues would be virtually undetectable by the naked eye. 

The defence case 

47Apart from the cross-examination of the complainants and otherwise by way of submission, the appellant's case comprised his interview with police, expert evidence from Dr Moses, a drug information pharmacist, and extensive character evidence. 

48The appellant told police that he met the two complainants at a bar and bought them and their friends champagne which they drank while they chatted. He invited the group to come back to his apartment to watch the sunrise. The two complainants accepted the offer and went with him to his apartment. When they got there MD started mixing drinks and helping himself to bottles of wine. At one point MD disappeared and the appellant found him lying fully clothed on his bed. He told MD that he should leave but that, if he wanted to sleep, he should do so in one of the other bedrooms. AW then entered the bedroom and the appellant told her they should probably leave but she could sleep in the other bedroom if she wanted. He left the room. When he returned both complainants were asleep on his bed. He woke them and called them a taxi and they left. AW gave him her number and told him to contact them if he were ever in Melbourne. 

49The appellant denied any wrongdoing. He said that he did not give the complainants any drinks containing a stupefying drug and did not give them any cocaine. 

Dr Moses' evidence 

50Dr Moses is a senior consultant pharmacist in the Drug Information Centre, at the Mater Public Hospital in Brisbane, which operates a call centre for drug information and help. Her doctorate in clinical pharmacy involved a substantial research thesis dealing with adverse drug reactions. A significant finding of her research, undertaken with a team of researchers and continued after she received her doctorate in 2005 up to the time that she gave her evidence, was that by involving consumers in adverse drug reaction reporting, reactions are discovered which are unexpected and not reported by doctors. This was true in respect of zolpidem. The adverse medicine event line (which Dr Moses managed) received thousands of calls about the drug. She had dealt with over a thousand. Dr Moses has presented a number of papers on the results including at the 2007 International Pharmaco-Vigilance Conference. She also presented papers at the Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Pharmaceutical Society Meeting. At the time she gave evidence she was in the process of writing a paper dealing with general drug safety in relation to zolpidem and zopiclone, a related drug. 

51Dr Moses' research showed that zolpidem is being used recreationally, that is for non-medical purposes. There were many papers describing addiction to zolpidem from recreational use. Reported immediate effects of the drug included hallucinations and double vision. She had also found that the drug had been taken with a stimulant so that the user could remain awake while friends watched them behave uncharacteristically being less inhibited. Some users also experienced sleep walking without any memory of having done so. There are reports of the drug having a calming or euphoric effect, which was a surprise to the medical profession. She referred to several papers reporting case studies of such an effect from zolpidem use. This was also disclosed in her conversations with zolpidem users. She said that zolpidem was commonly used with cocaine to prevent the feelings of depression, agitation and irritability (a ""crash"") associated with coming down from that drug. She had also received reports that zolpidem enhanced the effect of cocaine. 

52Dr Moses said that she had not received reports of zolpidem being used as a drink-spiking drug but she did not disagree with Dr Perl as to how it might work in those circumstances. She said that there are many papers describing people becoming addicted to zolpidem, some taking up to sixty tablets a day without sleep because they develop a tolerance to the drug. Dr Moses pointed out that zolpidem had many effects which would not be expected from a sleeping tablet, one of them being an anti-anxiety and euphoric effect. She said that cocaine always wears off quickly and thus people can experience a sudden feeling of depression and sedatives, typically benzodiazepines, are used that cushion that effect. She said that zolpidem is frequently used as a replacement for benzodiazepines. 

53Dr Moses was also asked about dissolving tablets of Stilnox. She said that the drug also contained magnesium stearate filler and hydroxybenzoate preservative which ""often present solubility problems"". Testing was necessary before she was able to determine the solubility of the drug. She said, ""We've encountered this often in the therapeutic setting, that the non-drug bit floats at the top as great big plastic lumps"". 

54Dr Moses testified that if a person affected by a large amount of alcohol took zolpidem and was a social drinker (meaning someone who drinks on the weekend and once or twice a week) and was not a regular user of sleeping tablets, the time for it to take effect would not change from the usual period of 15 to 20 minutes. 

55In cross-examination, she was asked about the effects of zolpidem on the complainants, assuming they consumed (as stated by them) 15 to 18 standard drinks, bearing in mind that AW said her level of intoxication was relatively high but she was not impaired in speech or physically, that she recalled the sequence of events without memory loss, and had her wits about her up to the time she left the bar to go to the appellant's apartment and that her friends said she had a relatively high tolerance for drinking alcohol. Dr Moses said that AW's alcohol ingestion ""suggests ... a very high tolerance to the sedative/hypnotic effect"" of zolpidem ""because they can take a lot of alcohol they can take a lot of zolpidem as well, or any zolpidem"". She went on to say that cocaine is a stimulant and would ""help keep them awake ... [S]o any sleep inducing effect [of the zolpidem] would also be delayed"". She pointed out that, considering the time of day (about 7am), the physiological effects of the body wanting to sleep in any event needed to be taken into account. As to whether alcohol magnified the effects of zolpidem she said that it depended on the quantity but, following 15 to18 standard drinks, ""I think one zolpidem tablet would be just like another drink"" and two tablets ""... [W]ould be just like taking two more drinks... [as]... they would be very tolerant to it."" She added: 
However, the thing that one needs to consider is that the extra special pharmacology of zolpidem is that the combination of alcohol and zolpidem is not that the combination makes you extra sleepy. The manufacturer's warnings have been placed there because of the risk of sleep walking. This odd drug stimulates behaviour, changed behaviours, so it can also make some people appear more awake or do things. 

56Dr Moses agreed that the blood analysis results were consistent with the complainants having ingested one to two tablets of Stilnox at some time during the previous 12 hours. She disagreed with Dr Perl's opinion that, had the complainants taken the Stilnox at, say, the previous midnight whilst at the bar, she expected they would have slept before they left to go to the appellant's apartment. Dr Moses added: 
... They have a very high tolerance to sedatives, especially alcohol, so they could have taken that and remained up standing and just been very fuzzy in the head. 

Q. So here there is a difference of opinion, is there, between yourself and Dr Perl? 
A. Yes. 

Q. So your opinion is that at midnight the previous night when all of the people, when the two complainants were still at Baron's Bar, that they could have somehow got up to two tablets each into their system and remained awake and functioning and so on until at least 7.00am the next morning? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And that's in the case of a woman who hadn't had Stilnox since 2002? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And in the case of a man who had never had any in his life? 
A. Yes. 

Q. In the expression of that opinion by you, with respect, is there room for legitimate differences of opinion between experts? 
A. Yes. 

The summing up 
Preliminary directions 

57The summing up commenced with the conventional preliminary directions. He pointed out, as is usual, that it was for the jury to assess the credibility and reliability of the witnesses and that they were able to accept, if they were so minded, all or any part of a witness' testimony. His Honour told the jury to consider counsels' submissions and give them such weight as they thought fit, bearing in mind that they were not evidence in the case. His Honour said that he did not intend to express a view about the evidence but that, if he did so, such a view was to be disregarded unless it happened to agree with the jury's own independent assessment. He added that, in summing up, he would endeavour to focus on the evidence in respect of which counsel appeared to him to have devoted much of their attention but that the jury should consider all the evidence and not only that to which he referred. Following an exhortation to the jury to use their experience, reason, judgment and common sense, the judge referred to the burden of proof. 

58The judge said, amongst other things, that, although the appellant did not give evidence, he gave a version of events in a recorded interview to police upon which he was entitled to rely and which they were required to take into consideration. He pointed out that the appellant had also adduced evidence of character and the expert evidence of Dr Moses. His Honour emphasised that the appellant bore no onus and, in particular, no onus to prove that the complainants had motives for lying, although part of the defence case was that the complainants, MD in particular, were motivated to make their allegations by the hope of getting some money from the appellant. 

Directions concerning the elements of the offences 

59His Honour moved to explaining the elements of the offences. In respect of the first two counts he explained the meaning of ""stupefying"" and pointed out that the intention alleged was that of indecently assaulting AW. In explaining how intention might be inferred, his Honour told the jury: 
It is frequently the case that a person's acts themselves may provide the most convincing evidence of intention. In this case the Crown relies on the evidence of [AW] as to the placing of a hand down her pants by the accused as something from which you could draw that his intention in administering the stupefying drug was to enable himself to, in fact, commit that indecent assault, and you might otherwise consider what purpose, if you were to find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did administer a stupefying drug to MD, you might think there could be in the circumstances of these people he had just met, being in his home in the early hours of the morning, perhaps no other intention than something of that nature. It wasn't to assist them perhaps to have some sleep - that is if you find that he did cause MD to take the drug on count 1. 

60The judge then defined what is meant by ""indictable offence"" and explained that indecent assault was such an offence. He instructed the jury that ""the indecent assault, the suggestion that that was the intention [in the first two counts] ... also comes up obviously in relation to the third count in the indictment ..."", the elements of which he then identified. 

61His Honour explained that the element of indecency was proved if the appellant had intentionally touched AW without her consent and that the touching was indecent if it was ""contrary to the ordinary standards of respectable people in this community"". His Honour added: 
For an assault to be indecent it must have a sexual connotation or overtone. If he accused touches the complainant's body... in a way which clearly gives rise to a sexual connotation, that is sufficient to establish that the assault was indecent, for example, touching the genitals or anus or breasts of a female. 

62His Honour instructed the jury that: 
... importantly, in respect of the third count in the indictment, the Crown is not so limited to ""stroking of the vagina""... 

The Crown in opening the matter said this in part in relation to setting out what it said the Crown anticipated the evidence would be, and... the relevant part is this: 
""He put his hand on her vagina and stroked it or made some such movement."" 

63His Honour then returned to the first two counts and said: 
...[W]hat is charged is that [the appellant] ...caused each of [the complainants] to take the stupefying drug with the intention to enable him to do something. If you found beyond reasonable doubt that he administered the stupefying drug and that he did so with the intention of indecently assaulting [AW], then you in fact do not need to find that he did in fact subsequently indecently assault her, because the thing in question is: What was his intention at the time of causing them to take the stupefying drug? 

Now of course the Crown relies on what it says happened thereafter in order to show you that that was his intention at the time. That is, in relation to that particular charge it is the intention, whether it is carried out or not, that is relevant. 

That takes me to one other matter that I think is convenient to deal with at this time, and that is this. When Mr Brady on behalf of the accused commenced his closing address he said this to you at the outset. 

'Well, after all that evidence, those submissions from the Crown, going through the evidence, you might think that this matter actually comes down to a single simple question that you can decide this matter even after all that evidence and all the Crown has gone through with a single, simple question. When I say single, simple question, I don't mean to imply that it's not important. It is a hugely important question, hugely important to the accused, the administration of justice but that single simple question is this. Can you be sure beyond any reasonable doubt that [AW] told you the truth? Can you be sure beyond any reasonable doubt that [AW] told you the truth, not the truth that she believes but the actual truth?' 

Mr Brady went on to say this however. 

'I'll put it another way. Can you be sure beyond any reasonable doubt that the accused actually stroked [AW's] vagina? Because that's really the Crown case. All that other stuff, everything that happened, all the things that they put to you, all come down to that. Because what they say happened was the accused did all these things with the intention of stroking her vagina and actually doing it and that's the single simple question you have to ask yourselves. Unbelievably important question. Can you be sure beyond any reasonable doubt that he actually did it?' 

That was no doubt a dramatic way to commence and get your attention in a closing address. But as I have just pointed out to you, the first count in the indictment is what was the intention, not whether he actually did it, what was the intention at the time if you find that he caused them to take a stupefying drug . 

It is not simply a matter that if the Crown or if you do not accept beyond reasonable doubt that the accused stroked her vagina, that that is the end of the matter, and the suggestion is implicit in what Mr Brady said. That if you cannot find that there was an actual stroking of the vagina, that that is the end of it. Well, as I have just said, that cannot possibly be correct in respect of either of the first two counts in the indictment and more importantly in respect of the third count in the indictment, the Crown is not so limited to ""stroking of the vagina"" that you were referred to by Mr Brady. 
(emphasis added) 

64The judge then mentioned that the Crown, in his opening, had referred ""to [the appellant's] hand being on [AW's] vagina and 'stroked it or made some such movement'"". He then gave the following direction: 
What the indictment alleges, or what is set out as being the charge, 'did commit an act of indecency' is not limited to proving her vagina was stroked. It is not limited to proving that it was touched. What the Crown has put is that there was an act of indecency. The act of indecency is according to what I have said to you before, indecent means contrary to the ordinary standards of respectable people in this community, and it is up to you to determine those standards..."" 

An act of indecency is inclusive of putting the hand down the underpants, inclusive of touching the vagina, inclusive of stroking it. But it does not all come down to whether you have to find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused actually stroked [AW's] vagina. I have not said that to be critical of Mr Brady's address, but to simply try [to] refocus you on the real issue in this matter and to make sure that you understand that the act of indecency as alleged is not limited to a stroking of the vagina. 

(In the discussion below, when considering the second ground of appeal, this passage is referred to as his Honour dealing with the ""single simple question"".) 

Complaint 

65The judge then moved on to deal with the evidence of complaint and explained that it could be used for the purpose of considering whether AW's complaints were consistent with the conduct that she alleged occurred and as evidence supporting the truth of her allegations. His Honour reminded the jury that AW was the only person able to say what happened to her in the bedroom and that a false or inaccurate statement does not become more reliable just because it is repeated. He told the jury that it was also relevant to the question of the complainant's reliability that she had been drinking and was affected by alcohol and had also taken cocaine and was affected by Stilnox, which may have affected the reliability of what she believed to be her recollection. 

Expert evidence and good character 

66His Honour then moved to the expert witnesses, giving conventional directions as to how their evidence should be considered. He pointed out that there was no issue about the relative expertise of Dr Perl or Dr Moses. His Honour then briefly mentioned the other scientific evidence, for example that of drug and alcohol analysis. He reminded the jury that MD had told Dr Brennan that he had 15 to 18 standard drinks, with his last drink before the cocktail in the appellant's apartment at 5.00am. He did not, however, identify the conflict in the evidence of Dr Perl and Dr Moses. In particular there was no mention of their evidence concerning the euphoric effects of zolpidem or the effects it has on experienced drinkers. 

67His Honour then took the jury to the evidence of time referring to sunrise at 5.38am and photographs which indicated the time. His Honour pointed out that there was no evidence of DNA which implicated the appellant in the offences. After some further mention of expert evidence, his Honour moved to the evidence of good character and then to the fact that the accused did not give evidence and that it could not be used by the jury to draw an adverse inference. He did not attempt to summarise the appellant's case as it appeared in the police interview. 

The Crown's submissions 

68His Honour then moved to the submissions made by the Crown on the one hand and the defence on the other. He told the jury that he did not intend to simply repeat everything that they had said but to try to give a brief outline of their arguments and merely because he did not address all of the arguments put by either the Crown or the defence did not indicate his view about any submission made but was simply the result of attempting to be brief. Even though he might omit some part of counsel's submission, it should be taken into account. 

69The judge commenced with the Crown's closing address. He referred to the Crown's submission that the complainants had been frank and honest and held professional and responsible positions in society and that they admitted to having used some drugs in the past and cocaine on the night in question. His Honour then referred to the sequence of events identified by the Crown and told the jury that he would not go through the times or the sequence of events except to the extent necessary to refer to some of the Crown's submissions as they had the transcript of the evidence. 

70His Honour then referred to the Crown's submissions in relation to good character and the possibility that a person of good character may have a ""double life"". He also referred to a controversy as to whether the invitation to the appellant's apartment was extended to all of the persons present at the club at the time or only to the complainants and pointed out that in a social situation people might well perceive things differently and queried whether it made any real difference. His Honour referred to the Crown's submission that the appellant's invitation was somewhat insistent and that he plied the complainants with liquor. He commented that the character witnesses said the appellant was generous and frequently bought French champagne for people. 

71His Honour then dealt with the Crown's submissions as to whether the complainants took cocaine earlier in the evening or at the appellant's apartment and to the submission that as they were out with friends for dinner, and were anticipating that MD would need to carry out his usual trading activities at 10.00am the following day, it was not likely that he would want to be in a condition where he could not function. His Honour briefly referred to the Crown's summary of the complainants' evidence in relation to the cocaine, and the Crown's submission that they readily said that they had voluntarily taken it at the appellant's apartment, they had no reason to deny they had used it earlier if that were the fact, the more so since they also admitted having taken speed or ecstasy in the past. 

72The judge then summarised the Crown's arguments as to the complainants' evidence of how they felt while they were at the bar, in particular that, although they were both relatively intoxicated, AW had not felt anything untoward until after she had commenced to drink the cocktail provided by the appellant and that she was aware that she felt something substantially different from the combined effects of alcohol and cocaine. His Honour then referred to the issue as to who had made the drinks, the appellant denying that he had done so and asserting that MD had helped himself to the alcohol. He referred to the Crown's reliance on the fact that the apartment was the appellant's and he would be more likely to offer a drink than for MD to make one himself. The judge referred to MD's hope that the appellant might be able to introduce him to potential clients and that it would be unlikely that he would wish to become so drunk in the manner suggested by the appellant in his interview with police and abuse the appellant's hospitality by making his own drinks. 

73He then referred to the issue of the timing including the 7.00am telephone call AW made to Ms Gilchrist and Ms Mahoney, which supported certain aspects (though not controversial) of the complainants' evidence. He invited the jury to infer that their evidence of how AW was speaking was coincident with the onset of the effects of the Stilnox, together with the alcohol. His Honour then referred to the Crown's submission, relying on Dr Perl's evidence, that in the normal course of events someone taking Stilnox, unaffected by any other drug, would fall asleep within 15 minutes to half an hour of taking the drugs. He then referred to the Crown's submission that at about 7.18am AW sent an SMS message that she could not concentrate, a message which she had no recollection of sending, and that this also indicated the Stilnox had started to take effect. His Honour then repeated Dr Perl's evidence that it would take between 15 minutes to half an hour for the Stilnox to have effect, though this might be delayed by the taking of cocaine. 

74His Honour then mentioned the Crown's position as to the significance of the search of the premises, including the fact that a cocktail shaker was not found, reminding the jury of the Crown's reference to the evidence of police that no one was particularly looking for it during the search. His Honour pointed out that, since it was alleged that a cocktail shaker was used to mix the drugs into the drink, police ought to have had the common sense to search for it but, in the end, there was no evidence as to whether there was a cocktail shaker in the apartment or not. His Honour then pointed out, after dealing briefly with the search, that no cocaine was found nor were any particular utensils that might have been used to ingest it. 

75He then noted that the Crown referred to AW's evidence that although she was suffering from some degree of intoxication from alcohol she felt she had been drugged, that she was not in control and she did not have her wits about her. His Honour referred to the argument of the Crown: 
... that the real issue in the case was when the Zolpidem got into [the complainants'] systems and pointed out that it makes you sleep and that although the onset may be delayed by cocaine... although Dr Perl had said... as to the finding in the blood samples of Zolpidem... it could have been taken at any time up to twelve hours before... the Crown said in that respect... that was really unlikely, because if they had taken it twelve hours before... the blood samples were taken at 3pm on, that day, 30 December, you would be back to sometime in the early hours of the morning at Baron's Bar, and that it would be unlikely that they would have taken it then, because the effect of it would have been to send them to sleep, particularly if it had a cumulative effect, together with alcohol. That is, if you have had enough alcohol and you are feeling tired and drowsy from that, if you take Stilnox on top of that, the net result should be that you fall asleep, and if they had taken that while they were at the Baron's Bar, they should have been well under its influence before 7.00am the following morning at the accused's premises. 

76His Honour referred to the Crown's criticism of Dr Moses' evidence that because the complainants had a high tolerance to alcohol they might have had a high tolerance to sedatives such as Stilnox, because there was no evidence of a tolerance of that kind. His Honour referred to the fact that AW had said she used a sedative some years in the past and the Crown's submission that the evidence of Dr Moses was inherently improbable, being based on an assumption of tolerance to sedatives which was not supported by any of the evidence and that the jury should prefer the expert evidence of Dr Perl. His Honour also referred to Dr Perl's evidence being at variance with that of Dr Moses as to the recreational use of Stilnox and the Crown's submission that the complainants could not have taken the Stilnox any earlier than when they claimed they were given the drug by the appellant because they would have been suffering from its effects much earlier and in effect, would not have been able to get to the appellant's apartment. 

77His Honour then referred to the Crown's submission as to an assertion the appellant made in his interview that no one had taken their clothes off. It was submitted that this statement was volunteered before there had been any suggestion put to the appellant that anyone had their clothes removed. His Honour referred to Mr Brady's submission to the effect that it could be expected one or more police officers had mentioned, before the interview was conducted, the allegation that at least MD had his clothes off or partly off but then reminded the jury that the Crown submitted there was no evidence of any police officer having told the appellant this at any time and that what the appellant said during the interview was volunteered by him before any such suggestion was made by interviewing police. 

78His Honour then referred to the Crown's submission concerning AW's evidence as to what happened after she realised the appellant's hands were touching her vagina. His Honour referred to the Crown's argument that AW was not attempting to piece things together but was actually relating a recollection although ""there may been fuzzy parts"", and the taxi driver witnessing AW's distress and that this was inconsistent with the appellant's assertion in the record of interview that, when the complainants left, they thanked him for his hospitality and his kindness, apologised for having had so much to drink and invited him to visit them in Melbourne. His Honour reminded the jury of the complainants' account of their departure, that MD said ""[s]o much for trust, what has been happening in the last three hours"", as reflecting that they did not part on good terms. 

79His Honour then referred to the Crown's submissions contrasting the statements of the appellant in his interview with the evidence of the complainants as to the meeting in Baron's Bar and the conversation that occurred there. He reminded the jury of what the Crown said about the first of the incidents, pointing out that both complainants gave similar accounts as to what had happened. He commented that the Crown was attempting to answer a potential argument by the defence that what had happened was some sort of hallucination but then quoted Mr Brady's unqualified statement to the jury that it had never been the defence case that the complainants had been hallucinating. 

80His Honour referred to the Crown's submission that the jury should accept the truthfulness and reliability of the complainants' evidence and repeated the sequence of events upon which the Crown relied. 

81His Honour also mentioned that the Crown ran through ""all the significant portions of the evidence in relation to Dr Perl and Dr Moses"" to which his Honour had already made some reference. (In fact, the Crown did not cover anything like the significant parts of Dr Moses' evidence and in one important respect misstated it.) His Honour said that the jury had the transcript of their evidence and he did not propose to go back through the material. He mentioned that one of the ""final points"" made by the Crown was that the appellant claimed that the complainants left around 6.00 or 7.00am which was inconsistent with the evidence of the taxi driver which showed that it is easy to make a mistake about time and that when someone is affected by a combination of drugs (alcohol, zolpidem and cocaine) memory might be patchy. His Honour then repeated the Crown's contention that, at the end of the day, Stilnox was found in the complainants' blood, that the accused had Stilnox with four tablets missing from one of the blister packs and the overwhelming inference was that they had been given Stilnox in the drink prepared by the appellant. 

Defence counsel's submissions 

82The judge then commenced his summary of Mr Brady's closing address. He repeated what he had said at the outset, that he was not attempting to put all counsels' arguments but was endeavouring to summarise them and that if he did not deal with some matters, this did not mean they were unimportant. His Honour added: 
Now to some extent it may seem from the length of time that it takes me to - hopefully - deal with Mr Brady's address in a shorter manner than it took to get through that of the Crown, that that may appear to you as though I have put more emphasis on the Crown case, but I think you will remember that the Crown, in going through the closing address, took the better part of a day and a half, and Mr Brady's address was about half a day or a bit less. 

Accordingly, it would naturally follow that you would not expect me to take so long in relation to dealing Mr Brady's address as with the Crown's address. But the important thing is that you have heard what counsel has said, and if their submissions are helpful to you - whether I refer to them or not - you should take them on board and consider them. 

83His Honour added shortly after: 
To some extent, some of the arguments that were raised by Mr Brady I have referred to or dealt with in going through the Crown case, and I don't intend to go over those again unless I deem it necessary to do so. Now, Mr Brady commenced talking to you about the highly important single question, and I will move on from that to what he then said to you, which was about the Crown's repetition [of matters in his address which did not make the Crown's argument any more correct.] 

84Thus the jury were reminded of the judge's emphatic dismissal of a major contention of the defence at the commencement of the summing up, namely that a doubt as to whether AW was indecently assaulted would lead inevitably to a doubt as to the appellant's guilt on counts 1 and 2. 

85As to the argument about repetition, his Honour said that this was of course so and reminded the jury of what he had said in relation to the complaints, namely, simply because something is said to a number of people does not necessarily give what is said more weight than when it was first said. His Honour then mentioned Mr Brady's arguments concerning the scientific evidence and his submission, in effect, that the Crown's scientific evidence would not be accepted ""beyond reasonable doubt"", adding the qualification ""now I might be slightly misstating that"". His Honour then pointed out that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the charge and the jury did not have to accept each part of the expert evidence but that it was ""something you take into account in weighing up what you make of all the evidence"", pointing out that the experts were not present in the appellant's apartment and the jury could simply talk about their experience or knowledge of the drugs in question. He added: 
...and you may have some doubts one way or the other - in relation to Dr Perl [and] in particular of Dr Moses - but its not a question of the Crown having to prove what Dr Perl has said is correct beyond reasonable doubt. 

86His Honour summarised Mr Brady's submission in respect of the scientific evidence as being that there was not much difference between what the experts said except that Dr Moses said that zolpidem could be used recreationally for Stilnox parties or coming down or by couples whereas Dr Perl was dismissive of the idea of Stilnox parties because everyone would simply go to sleep. His Honour said, in relation to the use of Stilnox as a recreational drug or to come off other drugs, ""whether you think those circumstances apply in this matter is a matter for you"". His Honour referred to Mr Brady's contrast of the experience of Dr Perl and Dr Moses, and then Dr Perl's agreement that the conduct outlined in the appellant's record of interview was perfectly consistent with Stilnox having been used. His Honour then commented: 
Well, of course, there are many things that could be consistent with the use of Stilnox. Neither of the experts can say to you that in terms of what is alleged by [the complainants] that actually happened. They were not there. They can only talk from their expertise about whether something might or might not be consistent with the effects they understand the drug has had. So an entirely different scenario to what is being put here could have been put to either of the experts, and you would have expected that in those circumstances, they would have said, ""Yes, well, that's consistent to,"" particularly if people are saying well, that they have a lack of memory as a result of what occurred. So you need to take that on board in deciding what you make of the submission that Dr Perl was saying, that the version put by the accused in the ERISP was perfectly consistent. 

87His Honour then referred to Mr Brady's argument that the accused's DNA was not found in the swabs taken from the complainants and commented: 
However you need to - as I said when I was taking through the Crown's address - you need to take into account what it was that the experts said... about what was possible to achieve by way of analysis of DNA and the actual tests that were carried out. 

88His Honour then quoted Mr Brady reminding the jury that AW's face and dress were swabbed for DNA because that was the sort of area where it might be expected to be found if someone had done what was alleged against the appellant. His Honour then commented as to this: 
Of course all that is alleged in this matter is touching the vaginal area by the accused. It is not alleged in the Crown case that there was anything more than that ... [b]ut it is wrong to say that you would have expected them to have found some DNA on [AW's] face or breasts if in effect the accused had done what had been alleged, because there is no allegation here of him doing anything to her face or breast. The allegation is a hand down the pants, touching the vagina, and you have heard the expert evidence about the possibilities of DNA being recovered in those circumstances. But importantly in relation to the accused's case, you should remember that there is no evidence of DNA which connects him to having carried out any action. 

89His Honour then referred to Mr Brady's argument that members of the public might think, from television programs, that DNA can be located any time and anywhere but that the appellant was happy to agree to provide a sample of his DNA immediately he was asked, suggesting that this was the action of an innocent man with nothing to hide. 

90The judge then reminded the jury of Mr Brady's denial that the defence had alleged any hallucinations, suggesting it was just an ""Aunt Sally"". His Honour repeated his explanation (given whilst summing up the Crown address) as to why the Crown had raised this matter and therefore ""... [w]hy you might expect that was not an unreasonable proposition for the Crown to take you to in the circumstances of this matter"". 

91His Honour reminded the jury of Mr Brady's summary of the defence case as a ""succinct expression of the central issue in terms of the defence's case"": 
It's always been our defence. They were completely off their head on alcohol, drugs. Had no idea what happened. Can't remember, woke up in a state not knowing what they had done. Tried to start piecing it together, so exaggerating in their own minds what had occurred and started to believe their own false memory. That's always been what we put. 

92His Honour then reminded the jury of Mr Brady's submission concerning the expert evidence, in particular that Stilnox could result in a flawed memory and people might consciously or unconsciously create false memories to replace what was missing, believing that what they had replaced was a genuine recollection of what had actually occurred. He then reminded the jury of Mr Brady's cross-examination of AW and the differences in her description as to how she found herself on the bed with MD and the accused and their relative positions. He quoted some of Mr Brady's cross-examination of MD and reminded the jury that they had a transcript of what counsel had said and that they could read it for themselves. Then he mentioned Mr Brady's submission that this evidence showed that some of what MD said may really have been the result of later conversation with AW and that it had become incorporated in his memory as a memory of his own because of that. 

93The judge then took the jury to Mr Brady's submissions concerning good character and mentioned also that several witnesses had referred to the appellant having two mobile phones, commenting: 
But of course none of them were with him on the night. So there is actually no evidence in the trial of [the appellant] having two mobile phones on 30 November 2006. There is evidence, as I said before, of him being asked about his mobile phone and providing a single number to the police during the course of the record of interview. 

94His Honour referred to Mr Brady's submission contrasting the appellant's good character with the fact that the complainant [AW] had past experience with drugs and had used a sedative some years in the past to come off speed and therefore it was possible she had used zolpidem to come off cocaine on the night in question. His Honour then added: 
Well, it is a matter for you, what you make of the evidence about past drug use. You have heard the Crown's submissions that their past drug use was illegal, but at least of a relatively minor sort, and that they were not hopeless junkies or poly-drug users or anything of that nature, and that you know that the fact that she might of used a downer some years in the past to come off ecstasy was hardly going to be information that would support the proposition that on this particular night, having taken cocaine together with [MD], they were then going to take Stilnox in order to somehow come down from it. 

95His Honour summarised Mr Brady's argument as being, in this respect, that giving Stilnox and cocaine to the complainants was inconsistent with the evidence of the appellant's character and commented: 
...but that their taking cocaine and Stilnox of their own accord would be somewhat consistent with their past experience. As I said, that is a matter for you to weigh up. 

96His Honour then referred to Mr Brady's appeal to the jury's common sense and the need to assess the reliability and accuracy of the evidence by seeing whether it made sense or not. Mr Brady had enumerated thirteen of the points in support of this submission to which his Honour then referred. 

97Firstly, if you were going to give a person a stupefying drug so that you could indecently assault them you would not do it by taking them to your own premises, giving your name, your company name and address and allow them to take a photo of you. Secondly, that it did not make sense that the appellant would go to the effort of drugging the complainants and then wait three hours before putting his hands down AW's pants. His Honour then referred to Mr Brady's third point, that it was unlikely the appellant would prepare the spiked drink whilst the complainants were watching him from the balcony because ""you would not want them to potentially see that you were crushing up something to put into a drink, etc"". As to this his Honour commented: 
Well, you would need to take into account, of course, the degree of sobriety of [AW] and [MD] when they are there sitting on the balcony and you also need to take into account whether or not you think they would be sitting there trying to look at the view or trying to look at him or whether they would simply look at him from time to time, if they thought that the delay was too long, and so were both looking at the view and at him, and whether he had any expectation that they were going to be interested enough in what he was doing there in order to notice if he was crushing something up. In fact, you do not know whether in terms of this event he had actually to crush something up. All you know is that, if the allegation is correct, that he placed Stilnox into the drink, then what the evidence is about is about him making the drink. Now whether that involved having to first crush the Stilnox is an entirely separate question. Perhaps it he did, perhaps he did not. 

98His Honour then reminded the jury of Mr Brady's fourth point that it was unlikely that, AW having woken and found the appellant with his hand down her pants, would go into the bedroom where MD was sleeping and, after eventually managing to wake him up and after telling him what had happened, then leave the room alone. This was inconsistent, Mr Brady argued, with her evidence that she was terrified. 

99The fifth point was AW's reminding MD, after the assault, that since it was about 10.00am, the market would be open and he should make a telephone call. Mr Brady submitted it did not make sense that MD would go to the kitchen to ring his stockbroker in circumstances where he had been told that AW had been indecently assaulted. The sixth point made by Mr Brady was that it would be most unlikely, in the circumstances, that AW would have given the appellant her mobile telephone number and to have waited inside the unit for the taxi rather than leaving as soon as possible and waiting for the taxi outside. 

100His Honour then commented as to these matters: 
But you will also need to take into account the evidence of [AW] and [MD] about the effect of what they say was the effect of the drug which you know was in their systems - Stilnox - the effect of the drug on them at that time, was that something that operated in order to make them do things or let them or allow them to do things in a fashion that you might not necessarily expect if someone was thinking with all their wits about them? 

101Mr Brady's seventh point was an argument that it was not necessary for the complainant to have keys to leave the apartment and thus that there was nothing in this issue of significance. His Honour commented: 
... [W]ell yes, you might think that. You know there was a conversation... about keys, and obviously the point about the keys is not about being able to use keys to get out. Maybe that you need them to get out, but certainly you would not expect anyone to go off to get cigarettes or perhaps go to examine a car or something of that nature unless they took with them the keys to get back into the unit. And as the Crown said to you, there is support for a conversation about keys, because it is heard by Mahoney and Gilcrest as part of the telephone conversation. 

102His Honour then mentioned Mr Brady's eighth point which was that there was some delay between the assault and AW breaking down and crying but, more significantly, it did not seem to make sense that someone in her condition would make a call to check their voice messages some five minutes later. Point nine was the argument, in connection with the last thing MD said to the appellant, namely ""[w]here's the trust? What happened here in the last three hours?"". Mr Brady added that if they were deliberately drugged by the appellant with the intention of indecently assaulting AW, what MD claimed to have said would make the appellant aware of the potential that they would report what had happened to them and yet he did not make any effort to dispose of the Stilnox. His Honour did not comment upon either of these two points. 

103Mr Brady's tenth point had already been referred to by the judge in the course of his summary of the Crown's submissions. It related to comments made by the appellant to police regarding [MD] not wearing clothes and Mr Brady's suggestion ""seriously, do you think ... the police are not going to have told [the appellant] one of the allegations is that [MD] woke up in his underpants?"". The judge mentioned that Mr Brady referred the jury to the fact that it had been put to the appellant in the record of interview. His Honour commented: 
... [B]ut of course, when they put it to them in the record of interview, it was after the point at which he had in fact raised the question of clothes himself, and as I said to you earlier, in trying to summarise the Crown case, there is no evidence of any police officer telling him before he raised it in the interview, anything specifically about the allegation that [MD] awoke with his clothes either off, or partly off. 

104The judge then mentioned Mr Brady's eleventh point which dealt with the fact that both MD and AW had said the same thing to Dr Brennan about how much alcohol they had consumed and also that they had two or three lines of cocaine but when they made their statement to the police later, they varied the quantity of cocaine to ""three or four lines"", quoting Mr Brady's remark, ""They say they didn't talk about it - well."" His Honour did not comment on this argument. 

105The twelfth point was that the jury could think that it was ""a bit bizarre"" that if the appellant intended to put Stilnox in the complainants' drinks, that he would also give them some cocaine which might, to some extent, counteract the effect of the Stilnox and that this did not make sense. His Honour commented: 
You have heard the evidence, which has been uncontradicted in effect from [MD], about the - and I think there was some support from Dr Perl about the extent to which cocaine, that is, how long it takes to take effect and how long it is going to provide an effect for, and that evidence was not that it was going to effect them for hours, but for a relatively short period of time. Certainly, comparatively with Stilnox, the cocaine would not have had a lengthy effect. 

106His Honour then referred to what he said was Mr Brady's ""last point"", that AW said she had never looked in the fridge, but in her statement to the police she talked about looking in the fridge and seeing the drawer slide out with all the alcohol, to which he asked rhetorically, if AW had not looked in the fridge how would she know the drawer slid out with alcohol? As to this argument his Honour commented: 
Well you may recall her evidence that she did not look in the fridge - you might think she was talking in the sense of opening the door to look in the fridge, but she said that she looked at the fridge and it had one of those glass panels in the door through which you could see the drinks compartment. So when she was talking about that, you might think that that is what she was talking about. But that is a matter for you, have a look at the evidence, see what you make of it. 

Mr Brady was suggesting that she said that she saw the drawer slide out because she did go in the fridge with [MD], because they were helping themselves to drink which is what the accused said in his interview. As I say, have a look at her evidence in respect of that. She did not agree that she ever went into the fridge, or that she looked in the fridge beyond looking in, and realising that it had a glass panel for the drinks compartment. 

107His Honour then took the jury to Mr Brady's submissions about the police search to the effect that it would be expected that the police would have been interested in finding the cocktail shaker and ""Officer Hunter said that he had [it] in fact in mind"" but no cocktail shaker or anything of that nature was taken by police although they seized a number of other items. As to this argument his Honour commented: 
Mr Brady referred to Mr Hunter as looking for a cocktail shaker, but his evidence was not in fact that he was looking for a cocktail shaker. His evidence was that he was aware from the briefing of the relevance of a cocktail shaker, and he said that if he had seen one he would have noticed it. So it is not quite the same, but you might think, in the circumstances, it was not any gross misrepresentation for Mr Brady to say that Mr Hunter was looking for one. 

108His Honour reminded the jury, without comment, of Mr Brady's argument that the police had not investigated the matter well because although a glass was found it was never seized. 

109The judge then took the jury to Mr Brady's submission concerning the SMS message from AW at 7.18am and the Crown's suggestion that it was a cry for help, commenting if it were so would it have been likely to have been signed ""xx or kiss kiss"". His Honour then mentioned Mr Brady's argument that a photograph showed a glass in MD's hand and AW's early response in cross-examination that it looked as though there was a brown liquid in the glass, AW not saying that it must be something else but responding that she did not know if MD had other drinks. His Honour commented: 
You might think that is a perfectly reasonable suggestion in the circumstances of this matter, where she has [a] failed memory in relation to some parts of the evening, where she says she has difficulty putting some things into chronological order, that it was reasonable for her to concede that he may have had other drinks that she was not aware of, or at least could not remember. 

But his Honour qualified this comment by adding: 
What Mr Brady was saying in respect of that was essentially that it was another one of those points of unreliability, in the sense that the evidence-in-chief was that there was just the one drink, yet when tested by looking at the photograph - whether it was a drink or not in the photograph, she was then prepared to concede that she could not actually say that he had not had other drinks. 

110His Honour then dealt with Mr Brady's argument about whether AW actually knew her vagina was being stroked or not. Mr Brady had taken the jury to the evidence of Ms Gilchrist and set out part of the transcript which contrasted AW's evidence about the appellant stroking her vagina as being something she remembered having happened rather than something she feared might have happened with what AW told Ms Gilchrist that she ""may have been assaulted"", she had feared ""something had occurred"". Mr Brady reminded the jury of Dr Perl's evidence about people trying to work out what had happened after the consumption of quantities of drugs or alcohol and the possibility of creating false memories in support of the submission that AW had no actual memory of what had happened in the apartment after a certain hour even though she might genuinely have believed that she was indecently touched. 

111In relation to this argument his Honour commented that the jury needed to put what was said by Mr Brady within the context of Ms Gilchrist's cross-examination. His Honour then proceeded to read her evidence ""... the manner in which it was in part paraphrased by Mr Brady just so that you have that part that he has put to you in context as to whether they were actual words used or not"". The passage brought to the jury's attention was: 
Q. What did she say to you in that phone call? 
A. She had started to elaborate on that she believed she may have been assaulted and may have been drugged, to which point I got quite upset. I guess I'd never received a phone call like that before and [AW] just refrained from telling me any more because I got a fair bit emotional, and then a work colleague took me home. 

Q. What words did [AW] use when telling you that she might have been drugged? 
A. To be honest I can only recall the emotion of the moment, I can't actually recall any of the conversation for example. 

Q. What words did she use when she said that she may have been assaulted? 
A. Yeah I actually don't know the specific but yeah but yeah she had feared something had occurred. 

His Honour concluded ""so that is the evidence that was given by Ms Gilchrist on that topic. As I said you have the transcript, you can take that into account when considering the submission made by Mr Brady"". 

112(We note that it appears that Mr Brady had fairly set out the purport of Ms Gilchrist's evidence and his Honour's comment which was to suggest to the jury that he had not done so was inappropriate.) 

113His Honour then reminded the jury of Mr Brady's submissions about MD's evidence in support of the submission that he and AW had no idea as to what had happened in the appellant's apartment because they were so intoxicated and were trying to work out what occurred retrospectively. Mr Brady had taken the jury, and his Honour repeated, to a number of apparent inconsistencies and problems with MD's memory, in particular to the time at which the cocaine was ingested which he had said was 4.00am, which was before the complainants arrived at the appellant's unit. Mr Brady's argument about the times and, in particular, when cocaine was ingested was referred to extensively by his Honour without comment. 

114The judge also reminded the jury of Mr Brady's submission that the character evidence called by the appellant was that he had nothing to do with cocaine, the witnesses did not believe that he would be involved with the drug and had never seen him involved with it or saying anything about using it. His Honour concluded this part of the summing up with the following: 
Now, as I said to you before, I have endeavoured to cover most of the submissions that have been put in a slightly shorter form. In doing so, it has now taken me almost as long to do the defence case as the Crown case, which I did not anticipate. Please, in respect of anything that I have said, if you feel that I have over-emphasised one case or the other, please ignore it. I have simply been trying to put the corresponding arguments to at least remind you of them, particularly since you heard them last week. If what I have said is helpful to you, if it agrees with what the Crown or the defence have said to you, agrees with what you think, then by all means you utilise it in coming to your verdicts. 

However, if anything that any of us has said about what you might make of the evidence, or in fact what the evidence is, you do not agree with that, then you have to rely on your own view. Anything that we say to you, except for the directions of law that I have given to you, anything else that we have said about - that is myself, the Crown or Mr Brady - have said about the particular circumstances or the evidence and what you might make of it, is purely designed to assist you in understanding how the parties put their cases and assist you in coming to your verdicts. 

115His Honour then suggested to the jury as to where they might commence their deliberations, by saying that ""a reasonable starting point in relation to any of these charges is to look at the first and common element to the two charges"", continuing (by way of restating the Crown case): 
Now, it is the same element that is in each of these first two counts. And you understand that the Crown's case is that they had no Stilnox knowingly; neither [MD] nor [AW] took any Stilnox, and as far as they are concerned, the only time in which it could have got into their systems was when they were given the strong lemon flavoured drink at [the appellant's] premises. 

116His Honour suggested the jury would well understand that if they did not accept beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had caused the complainants to take the Stilnox then it would be unnecessary to consider the second element, namely that the drug was administered with the intention of indecently assaulting AW. His Honour then added: 
But remember what I said, that it is the intent at the time of the administration, or causing to be taken the stupefying drug, that is relevant. 

There need in fact be no indecent assault thereafter occurring, but in the circumstances of this matter, what the Crown relies on is not just the administration of the stupefying drug, but the conduct thereafter. He relies on not simply the allegation that the accused put his hand down [AW's] pants and touched her on the vagina, it also relies on the other conduct of which you heard. That conduct includes what you have heard from both [MD] and [AW] about the three of them somehow ending up on the bed in their somewhat confused mental state, but the accused then being on the bed with them on the other side of [AW] and touching her body. I am not suggesting that that is an indecent assault. I am just suggesting that it is something that you can take into account in terms of whether you find the intention was to commit an indecent assault. 

117His Honour then dealt with the indecent assault alleged by the Crown, namely that the appellant ""put his hand down the pants of [AW], and that he touched her on the vagina."" 

118His Honour then said: 
You might think, if you could not accept [AW] beyond reasonable doubt in respect of [the appellant] having done that, that her reliability in respect of that particular piece of evidence might reflect on what you make of her evidence that is relevant to the other two charges. 

This direction was apparently given in response to the application by Mr Brady for a Markuleski direction. 

Submissions on the appeal 

119The Crown acknowledged the trial judge's obligation to sum up in a way that is fair, balanced and impartial and submitted that is what occurred here. She submitted that his Honour's comments were appropriate. She pointed to the opening remarks of the trial judge explaining the different functions of judge and jury and the direction given on the second day of the summing up, pointing out to the jury that if he had said anything which overemphasised one case or another they should ignore it unless it was consistent with their thoughts and that if anything had been said either by him or counsel which the jury did not agree with, the jury should rely on its own view. These passages have been set out above. 

120So far as the ""single simple question"" argument is concerned, the Crown submitted that his Honour was correct to point out that the act of indecency relied upon by the Crown encompassed each or any of the appellant's putting his hand down the complainant's underpants, his touching of her vagina or his stroking it. She submitted that the judge was correct to direct the jury that, in relation to counts 1 and 2, the appellant's intention to commit an indecent assault was critical, not whether that intention was ultimately fulfilled. She submitted that Mr Brady's submission to the jury that a doubt about whether the indecent assault occurred meant that the jury should acquit on the first and second counts was another way of stating the proposition, ultimately accepted by his Honour as an appropriate jury direction pursuant to Markuleski , that if the jury rejected AW's evidence on the indecent assault, they could use that finding to assess her reliability on other aspects of her evidence. 

121In respect of the trial judge's direction that Mr Brady's submission about this matter ""cannot possibly be correct"", the Crown submitted that the ""extensive and repeated directions as to the role of the jury"" and as to the functions of the jury as the ultimate arbiters of fact, rendered the direction ""justified and fair"". 

122It was submitted that a fair reading of the judge's directions as a whole demonstrated that the complaint that it was unbalanced in favour of the Crown was not made out. Counsel pointed to the general and conventional directions given at the commencement of the summing up, the mention of the potential unreliability of the Crown witnesses, the vagueness of the Crown witnesses' evidence as to the chronology of events at the appellant's apartment and the appellant's good character. She submitted that the trial judge did not unfairly counter the defence's arguments in his commentary on some of counsels' points of argument and that a number of the criticisms made by the trial judge were well founded and in respect of many of the arguments his Honour made no comment at all. 

123It was submitted by Mr Hamill SC for the appellant that the acceptance of AW's evidence beyond reasonable doubt in proof of the third count was crucial to proof of the other two counts and, generally, a doubt about the reliability or credibility of her evidence in respect of the third count should be considered by the jury when assessing her evidence generally. He focused argument on the trial judge's direction that the jury could convict on the first two counts even if it were not satisfied that AW had been indecently assaulted, that this was a significant departure from the way in which those counts had been particularised and the way in which the Crown opened its case to the jury. For that reason, he submitted it was not open for his Honour to leave those counts to the jury in the way he did in the circumstances of this case. Furthermore, he submitted even if Mr Brady's argument as to the single simple question was limited to whether AW's evidence that the appellant stroked her vagina should be believed and, if it were not, that they must then acquit, this was a submission as to a matter of fact that counsel was entitled to make and the trial judge erred in directing the jury to disregard it. He submitted that if correction were warranted to ensure that the jury understood that, as a matter of law, the submission was wrong in focusing on the issue of stroking as distinct from touching the vagina, his Honour should have corrected that aspect of the argument and then directed the jury that, if the effect of disbelieving AW's evidence of stroking was that the jury did not accept the reliability of her evidence as to any indecency having occurred, then the appellant must be acquitted on all counts. 

124Finally, Mr Hamill submitted that the summing up of the respective cases of the prosecution and defence was so imbalanced as to lead to a miscarriage of justice. He emphasised that the judge's summary of the Crown case was subject to only a passing comment as to the defence case in response, whilst his Honour's summation of the defence case was subjected to continuous adverse commentary as to significant points sought to be made by defence counsel. The effect was that, so far from being a summary of the defence case, it was a summary of the reasons for why it should be rejected by his Honour's restatement of the Crown case. 

The ""single simple question"" and Markuleski 

125As we have already observed, it is theoretically possible that, even if there had been no evidence of any indecent assault having occurred in respect of AW, the jury may have been able to infer, from all the circumstances, that the appellant drugged the complainants, conceivably for the purpose of committing some unspecified and unknown indictable offence, although it may be strongly doubted that a charge in such terms would be valid. However, the Crown case was never put in this way. It was essential (in the circumstances of this case) that before the jury could convict on the first two counts, it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that AW had been indecently assaulted in one way or another. The only indecent assault of which there was evidence was that of AW who said the appellant's hand was inside her pants and was touching her vagina when she woke in his bed. If that evidence were not accepted, there being no other evidence relied upon by the Crown as to the appellant's intention the intention of the appellant in administering the zolpidem could not be proved and, accordingly, the appellant could not be convicted of any of the charges. This follows not only from the circumstances but also from the specific way in which the prosecution particularised the charges and ran its case. It was this case which was put by the trial judge to the jury. This also shows, incidentally, that the trial judge's suggestion that the jury should commence its consideration of the charges by dealing first with counts 1 and 2 because it was not an element of those offences that an indecent assault actually occurred, was inappropriate in this case when the very opposite was necessary. 

126When the trial judge criticised Mr Brady's identification of the ""single simple question"" by pointing out that ""the first count in the indictment is what was the intention [in administering the drug], not whether he actually did it"", this was likely to confuse the jury as to what were the real, as distinct from the hypothetical, issues in respect of the first two counts. Mr Brady's argument amounted to the contention that, if the jury had a reasonable doubt whether the appellant actually indecently assaulted AW then (having regard to the way in which the counts were particularised) the appellant must be acquitted. 

127It will be evident from the passage in the summing up which is set out in [63] above that there appears to have been some confusion between whether it was necessary that the indecent assault comprised the ""actual stroking of the vagina"" or an act of indecency which did not involve this act. It is possible, perhaps, that the judge thought that Mr Brady was submitting that, even if there might have been a touching , unless the jury was satisfied that there was a stroking it must acquit. Such a submission required correction lest it be taken as a legal argument, but it was also necessary to make it clear to the jury as a matter of law that, absent satisfaction that some form of indecent assault occurred, the appellant must be acquitted of the first two counts. If, on the other hand, Mr Brady was merely urging the jury to find there was no indecent assault if it did not accept AW's evidence of stroking, since the basis for rejecting the reliability of AW's evidence of this would apply to any other indecent act, then this was a submission of fact which he was entitled to make and it ought not to have been subjected to the emphatic dismissal it received. 

128It is perhaps unfortunate that Mr Brady focused on the stroking allegation (though, to be fair to him, that was actually AW's evidence) but it seems to us this was simply an emphatic way of describing the alleged indecent assault. His Honour's direction that Mr Brady was wrong in respect of the first two counts was in general terms and had the very real potential to be understood by the jury as a direction that the argument was to be rejected root and branch, such that the jury would likely have understood his Honour as directing them, as a matter of law which it was bound to apply, that even if no indecent assault of any kind had occurred, the appellant could still be convicted of the first two counts. As we have said, although it is true that commission of an actual indecent assault is not an element of those charges, in the circumstances of this trial, proof of such an assault was essential since there would be otherwise no evidence of the requisite intention. 

129The direction that, in respect of the third count, the Crown was not limited to a stroking of the vagina was, of course, correct. 

130At the first opportunity to do so, Mr Brady raised the matter with the trial judge. He submitted that the jury were entitled to draw the conclusion that the trial came down to what he described as the ""single simple question"" for a number of reasons. The first reason was that it was fundamental to the Crown case that the indecent assault occurred, not only in relation to the third count, but also for the first two counts because the evidence of indecent assault was used by the Crown to support the element of intent in counts 1 and 2. The second reason was that, if the jury did not accept AW's evidence on the indecent assault, it also reflected on the reliability of the evidence she gave in respect of counts 1 and 2. These points did not quite cast the question as we have characterised it but, in all events, Mr Brady was entitled to put this submission to the jury even for the relatively limited purposes he identified. In the interests of fairness, the trial judge was, to our mind, duty bound to remind the jury of this submission and it was a significant miscarriage of justice not only not to do so but to direct the jury to disregard it. 

131As a separate but linked submission, Mr Brady asked that the trial judge direct the jury in accordance with R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82 to the effect that, if they had a doubt in relation to the reliability of AW's evidence in respect of count 3 that doubt could be used in respect of their consideration of her reliability on counts 1 and 2. His Honour indicated that he would consider giving such a submission and his Honour did so. However, it was (for the reasons already given) also necessary to point out to the jury that a doubt about the reliability of AW's evidence as to whether any indecent assault occurred (however characterised) must have the consequence that there was no evidence capable of proving an essential element of the first two counts. (It should be noted that the error in respect of the necessity to prove the indecent assault as a factual grounding for the first and second counts was rather more potential than real in light of the jury's conviction of the appellant on the third count.) 

132These matters can also be considered as aspects of the complaint that the learned trial judge did not adequately put the defence case to the jury. 

133Mr Hamill's submissions concerning the judge's direction as to the ""single, simple question"" and insofar as the inadequacy of the Markuleski direction is concerned should be accepted. 

The balance in the summing up 

Applicable principles 

134It is evident from what we have observed thus far that it is beyond question that a summing up must be fair, balanced and impartial. As the majority said in RPS v R [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 620 (per Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ): 
[41] ... The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial of the accused. That will require the judge to instruct the jury about so much of the law as they need to know in order to dispose of the issues in the case. No doubt that will require instructions about the elements of the offence, the burden and standard of proof and the respective functions of judge and jury. Subject to any applicable statutory provisions it will require the judge to identify the issues in the case and to relate the law to those issues. It will require the judge to put fairly before the jury the case which the accused makes. In some cases it will require the judge to warn the jury about how they should not reason or about particular care that must be shown before accepting certain kinds of evidence. 

[42] But none of this must be permitted to obscure the division of functions between judge and jury. It is for the jury, and the jury alone, to decide the facts. As we have said, in some cases a judge must give the jury warnings about how they go about that task. And, of course, it has long been held that a trial judge may comment (and comment strongly) on factual issues... 

135In R v Inamata [2003] NSWCCA 19; 137 A Crim R 510 Buddin J (with whom Handley JA and Sully J agreed), citing R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91, said: 
[28] ... as this Court said in R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91: 
""[a] judge is always entitled to express his view of the facts, provided that he does so with moderation and provided always that he makes it clear that it is the jury's function (and not his) to decide the facts and that it is their duty to disregard the view which he has expressed (or which he may appear to hold) if it does not agree with their own independent assessment of the facts ""(at 106-7). 

[29] In R v Courtney-Smith (1990) 48 A Crim R 49 this Court said: 
The assessment of the overall balance requires a consideration of the whole of the summing up. Isolated phrases taken from here and there are no substitute for a consideration of the entire charge, looked at as a whole and in its context in the trial. In many cases the summary of the Crown's case on the facts will necessarily take somewhat longer than the summary of the case for the accused. Often, the accused may give no evidence or may call only character evidence. The Crown's case being circumstantial may require some little elaboration. It is not the length of time devoted to the case of the Crown or the accused which is in issue. It is the fairness, balance and impartiality of the summing up which the appellate court must review and safeguard. (at p 56) 
[30] Also of relevance in the present context is the following passage from the decision of this Court in R v Ali (1981) 6 A Crim R 161 in which it was said that: 
It is frequently said that a summing up must present a balanced account of the conflicting cases. But when one case is strong and the other is weak it does not follow that a balanced summing up will be achieved by under-weighting the strong case and over-weighting the weak case. If one case is strong and the other is weak, then a balanced account inevitably will reflect the strength of the one and the weakness of the other. (at p 165) 

[31] The judge told the jury on a number of occasions that the facts were for them alone and that they were not bound to accept any opinion which he may have expressed. In those circumstances, and in the light of the authorities to which I have referred, it does not seem to me that upon a fair reading of the entire summing-up, that there is any substance in the appellant's submissions. 

136The requirement of balance in a summing up, namely the fair summation of both the prosecution and the defence case, also means that the trial judge should assist the jury by reminding them of the significant parts of the evidence that pertain to each side of the case. Ordinarily, he or she will be assisted in this task by the approach taken by counsel in their submissions. However, it is not appropriate to defer to counsel's view of how this should be done or as to which matters are important. The trial judge has an overriding and independent duty to bring to the jury's attention those parts of the evidence that reflect significantly on the factual issues in the case and to explain how the evidence impinges on them. This has a particular application to complex or unusual evidence outside the ordinary experience of lay persons. The expert evidence of Dr Perl and Dr Moses in this trial is in that category. 

137It is often difficult for jurors to assess the relative weight of expert evidence and, where it is an important part of the case, it will usually be necessary for a judge to take the jury through the evidence with some care to ensure that it is understood and its relationship to the issues in the case made clear. A general reference to differences between experts will usually not be sufficient to ensure the jury is adequately assisted in its task, especially in a case of this kind, where evidence from both experts was capable of shedding significant light on the respective cases. It seems to us that the jury should have been given assistance to understand, with some precision, how the opinions of Dr Perl and Dr Moses differed (and where there was agreement) and how those opinions might bear upon their consideration of the issues. In this case, that required a summary of the relevant opinions and the basis of experience or expertise that justified them. Having regard to the respective cases on the timing of possible reasons for and possible reaction to both the Stilnox and the cocaine, it was particularly unfair to the defence not to do so. 

138A further matter concerns the complainants' prior use of drugs, which (because of Dr Moses' evidence as to varying levels of tolerance) was capable of being a most significant matter. The Crown relied on the complainants' evidence of their very limited consumption of sedatives and submitted that there was no contrary evidence. Their evidence in this respect was summarised by the judge in apparent acceptance of the Crown's contention. The interests of fairness required his Honour to point out that, though the Crown's submission that there was no contrary evidence was correct as far as it went, that did not mean that the jury was bound to accept it and the jury needed to consider whether it accepted that part of the complainants' testimony. The jury should also have been reminded that Dr Moses' evidence as to tolerance of the sedative effects of zolpidem was not based solely on an assumption about prior sedative use but on the evidence of their tolerance to alcohol evidenced by the very significant quantity of alcohol consumed by both of the complainants that night. 

139Towards the end of his Honour's summing up, Mr Brady objected to the way in which his Honour had dealt with the defence case. Mr Brady conceded that the judge was entitled to express an opinion about the evidence but pointed out that: 
Your Honour is spending almost if not the same amount of time effectively re-putting what the Crown may say in answer to the defence's submissions throughout your summary of the defence's submissions, effectively, with respect, descending into the arena in answering what the defence say are things that the jury should take into account in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. 

140Mr Brady elaborated somewhat further on this point. The trial judge responded, ""Yes well there is not particularly much left to go Mr Brady, so I will try and refrain"", adding ""I don't propose to go back over what I've said"". In fact, as is clear from the summary of his Honour's summing up which is set out above, his Honour did put arguments to the jury in respect of the defence case. 

141In order to assess whether the summing up was fairly balanced, it is necessary to consider it as a whole and, for this reason, it has been extensively set out above. We are persuaded that the submission made on behalf of the appellant is correct that there was a marked lack of balance in the way the jury was directed as to the respective cases both in his Honour's summary of the evidence and the submissions of counsel. At virtually the outset of his directions on the elements of the offences, his Honour instructed the jury in language that reflected on the style as well as the substance of Mr Brady's argument put at the forefront of his closing submissions. His Honour went on to subject many of Mr Brady's points of argument to adverse comment, often in terms that suggested they were the judge's personal views rather than arguments that had been advanced by the Crown. In this way they had the potential to undermine the defence case in a most material way. Quite apart from the persuasiveness of his Honour's comments, the overall effect was to impermissibly undermine the defence case. 

Conclusion 

142In some respects, the Crown case was a strong one but there were significant matters appearing in the evidence, particularly arising from the expert evidence, that weakened it. Submissions were legitimately put by Mr Brady which the jury should have been invited to consider without the repetitious adverse comment from the judge to which reference has been made. The general directions about the differing functions of judge and jury and the importance of the jury considering for themselves what they made of the evidence and the arguments did not outweigh the powerful impression that the jury were likely to have formed concerning the weakness of the defence case and the personal opinion of the judge as to its insubstantial character. 

143In our view this is not a case for the proviso. Firstly, the jury's consideration of the appellant's guilt may well have been affected by the lack of balance in the trial judge's summing up; secondly, the nature of the evidence, in particular its crucial reliance on the credibility of the complainants cannot be adequately judged on the papers; and we are not satisfied that the verdicts were inevitable. 

144Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, quash the convictions and order a new trial in respect of each count.

		17 November 2011",2011-10-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709037,R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J and with his Honour's reasons. 

2In par [33] of his judgment, Johnson J emphasises that, as a matter of general principle, the Court should state that the utilitarian value flowing from a plea of guilty is not a fixed element and is capable of erosion as a result of the manner in which the sentencing hearing is conducted. I agree. Whilst, as Spigelman CJ pointed out in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [152], the primary consideration for the extent of a utilitarian discount was the timing of the plea this should not obscure the fact that there may be circumstances as Johnson J has pointed out where the utilitarian value may be eroded. Equally, there may be some exceptional circumstances in which it is appropriate to give a full utilitarian discount for a plea, notwithstanding the fact that it has not been entered at the earliest opportunity. 

3That is not to say that sentencing courts should not generally continue to follow the approach in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) A Crim R 1, but merely that the principles have to be applied by reference to the particular circumstances in any case. 

4HOEBEN J : I agree with Johnson J. 

5JOHNSON J : This is a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to sentences passed upon the Respondent, AB, at the Goulburn District Court on 9 March 2011 arising from a devastating motor vehicle collision. 

6As will be seen, the Respondent's children, MB (then aged 15 years) and JB (then aged 18 years) were injured in the collision as was DW (then aged 15 years), a friend of MB. As two of the three victims of the offences were under 18 years of age at the time of the offences, each of the victims will be referred to by initials in this judgment to further the purpose of s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 . In addition, the Respondent will be referred to by initials as disclosure of his identity would serve to identify MB. 

The Sentences 

7Following pleas of guilty entered in the Local Court, the Respondent was sentenced by her Honour Judge Murrell SC on 9 March 2011 as follows: 


 





Offence

Maximum Sentence

Sentence



Count 1 - On 17 January 2009 at Campbelltown, the Respondent did take and drive a 2001 Ford utility without the consent of the owner, JAXQuickfit Tyres Retails Pty Limited, contrary to s.154A(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900

Five yearsâ€™ imprisonment (s.117 Crimes Act 1900)

Imprisonment for a fixed term of three months from 28 May 2010 to 27 August 2010


Count 2 - On 18 January 2009 at Moss Vale, the Respondent did drive a vehicle, the 2001 Ford utility, when it was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to JB, and at the time of impact, the Respondent was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person/other persons contrary to s.52A(3)(c) Crimes Act 1900

Imprisonment for seven years

Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months from 28 June 2010 to 27 December 2011


Count 3 - On 18 January 2009 at Moss Vale, the Respondent did drive a vehicle, the 2001 Ford utility, when it was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to MB, and at the time of impact, the Respondent was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person/other persons contrary to s.52A(3)(c) Crimes Act 1900

Imprisonment for seven years

Imprisonment for a fixed term of two years commencing on 28 September 2010 and expiring on 27 September 2012


Count 4 - On 18 January 2009 at Moss Vale, the Respondent did drive a vehicle, the 2001 Ford utility, when it was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to DW, and at the time of impact, the Respondent was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person/other persons contrary to s.52A(3)(c) Crimes Act 1900

Imprisonment for seven years

Imprisonment for three years commencing on 28 December 2010 and expiring on 27 December 2013
 


8As against a total effective sentence of imprisonment for three years and seven months, the sentencing Judge set a non-parole period of two years and one month commencing on 28 May 2010 and expiring on 27 June 2012. 

9In addition, the sentencing Judge was asked to deal with the Respondent under s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 for a related offence of driving whilst disqualified contrary to s.25A(1)(a) Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 18 months. For that offence, the Respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for four months from 28 June 2010 to 27 October 2010. 

10With respect to each of Counts 2, 3 and 4, the Respondent was disqualified from driving for a period of four years from 9 March 2011. For the offence of driving whilst disqualified, he was disqualified for a period of two years from 9 March 2011. 

11There are problems with the sentencing orders in this case. It appears that her Honour purported to sentence the Respondent under the aggregate sentence provisions now contained in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , at least in the sense of fixing a single non-parole period. However, the aggregate sentencing provision (s.53A) and the provision to fix a single non-parole period for multiple offences (s.44(2A)) did not commence until 14 March 2011, five days after the Respondent was sentenced. I will return to these issues later in the judgment. 

The Grounds of Appeal 

12A Notice of Appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was filed by the Crown on 15 April 2011, asserting that the sentences passed were manifestly inadequate. In accordance with the usual practice: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 15-16 [33]-[38], the Crown filed a document on 25 April 2011, giving notice of grounds of appeal. The Crown relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

(a) Ground 1 - the sentencing Judge erred in failing to properly accumulate the sentences. 

(b) Ground 2 - the aggregate head sentence and the non-parole period are manifestly inadequate. 

13In response to questions from the Court at the hearing of the appeal on 16 August 2011 concerning the form and structure of the sentences, the Crown was granted leave to rely upon a further ground of appeal: Ground 1A - The trial Judge erred in failing to provide reasons for declining to set a non-parole period for Counts 2 and 3, contrary to s.45(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

History of Proceedings 

14Before turning to the facts of the offences, it is appropriate to place in context the sentencing hearings which took place concerning the Respondent's offences. 

15The offences occurred on 17 and 18 January 2009. A police investigation ensued thereafter with the Respondent being arrested and charged with the offences on 15 July 2009. 

16The Respondent first appeared before the Moss Vale Local Court on 21 September 2009. Thereafter, the proceedings were adjourned with the Respondent pleading guilty to the charges, and being committed for sentence by the Moss Vale Local Court on 2 March 2010. 

17The proceedings came before the Goulburn District Court on 12 April 2010 and were listed in the May 2010 sittings of that Court. 

18On 28 May 2010, the Respondent appeared before his Honour Judge Toner SC and adhered to his pleas of guilty. The sentencing hearing commenced and documents were tendered for that purpose. The sentencing Judge was informed that there was a factual dispute on sentence which required evidence to be given by DW and the Respondent. The Respondent disputed DW's account concerning the speed at which the vehicle was travelling shortly before it left the road. He disputed, as well, DW's account that DW had warned the Respondent to slow down shortly before the vehicle left the road. 

19As will be seen, DW was rendered a C2 tetraplegic as a result of injuries sustained in this collision. It was not possible to accommodate the taking of evidence from DW. It was necessary for the sentencing hearing to be adjourned. His Honour Judge Toner SC was not in a position to be part heard in the matter. 

20Over the opposition of counsel for of the Respondent, his Honour refused bail given the inevitability of a full-time sentence of imprisonment. 

21Thereafter, the Respondent's matter came before his Honour Judge Bennett SC in the November 2010 sittings of the Goulburn District Court. The matter was before his Honour on 15, 29 and 30 November 2010, but could not proceed because of continuing practical difficulties in arranging for evidence to be given by DW. The matter was adjourned until the next sittings of the Goulburn District Court commencing on 28 February 2011. 

22In due course, the sentencing hearing commenced de novo before her Honour Judge Murrell SC on 8 March 2011. DW gave evidence by audio-visual link and was cross-examined. The Respondent gave evidence and was cross-examined. The Respondent's sister also gave evidence on general matters relevant to sentence. Submissions on sentence commenced on 8 March 2011 and continued on 9 March 2011. At the conclusion of submissions, her Honour proceeded to sentence the Respondent. 

23Although the Respondent pleaded guilty to the charges in the Local Court and was committed for sentence, the course of the proceedings in the District Court was protracted and involved a significant evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed questions of fact. 

24The Respondent was given a 25% discount on sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas. At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing in the District Court on 9 March 2011 (T30-31), in response to an enquiry from the sentencing Judge, the Crown maintained the position that there was no issue about the 25% discount in the circumstances of the case. This was a generous concession by the Crown. 

25The Crown accepted in this Court that the present appeal should go forward upon the basis that the Respondent retains the benefit of the Crown concession in the District Court which saw him receive a substantial discount for the suggested utilitarian value of his pleas. However, by that time, the sentencing hearing had proceeded before three different Judges of the District Court over a period exceeding nine months between 28 May 2010 and 9 March 2011. It had been necessary, because of the Respondent's dispute as to facts, for DW, a young man who had suffered profound injuries as a result of the Respondent's criminal conduct, to give evidence and be cross-examined by audio-visual link. No doubt this process required DW to recall and relive the horrific events which gave rise to his injuries. 

26The proceedings before the District Court occupied more than 115 transcript pages over six sitting days between May 2010 and March 2011. There was, in reality, a substantial erosion of the utilitarian value flowing from the Respondent's pleas of guilty. 

27Where a sentencing Court is required to undertake a lengthy hearing in circumstances where there is an unsuccessful application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty ( R v Wilkinson (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [75]), or where, as in this case, there are disputed questions of fact which are resolved adverse to an offender, then a sentencing Court is entitled, if not required, to have regard to these practical events in assessing the utilitarian value flowing from the pleas of guilty. 

28It might be said in the present case that the time ultimately taken to deal with the Respondent's matters in the District Court, was close to the time which would have been occupied if he had gone to trial. 

29Further, DW was required to give evidence. The utilitarian discount for pleas of guilty does not reflect any other consideration arising from the plea, such as saving witnesses from giving evidence, but this is relevant to remorse: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at 10 [32]. It might be thought that the Respondent's insistence that DW give evidence at the contested sentencing hearing would operate against the Respondent on the question of remorse. 

30A person who pleads guilty to a criminal offence is, of course, entitled to dispute facts (beyond the elements of the offence) for the purpose of sentence. Where such a dispute occurs, any contested questions of fact adverse to an offender, must be established to the criminal standard of proof: O'Neil-Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 42. An offender is not to be penalised because he or she disputes certain facts on sentence and requires the Crown to prove those facts. 

31The position is analogous to that of a person who goes to trial, who may not be penalised for the manner in which the defence at trial was conducted: Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656 at 666-667 [30]-[34]. However, as is made clear in Siganto v The Queen , a person who goes to trial is not entitled to mitigation for a plea of guilty. 

32Likewise, a person who pleads guilty but puts the Crown to proof on certain factual issues and who loses that dispute, is not entitled to the same discount for a plea of guilty, on utilitarian grounds, as a person who does not require such a contested hearing. 

33These observations will have no application to the determination of the present Crown appeal. However, as a matter of general principle, this Court should state that the utilitarian value flowing from a plea of guilty is not a fixed element, and is capable of erosion as a result of the manner in which the sentencing hearing is conducted. This involves no more than an acknowledgment of the fact that what may be gained in utilitarian terms as a result of the avoidance of a trial may be lost, also in utilitarian terms, by way of a protracted sentencing hearing involving the adducing of evidence and the consumption of public resources for a purpose ultimately determined adversely to an offender. 

Facts of Offences 

34The sentencing Judge made findings of fact arising from an agreed statement of facts and other documentary materials tendered at the sentencing hearing, together with her Honour's conclusions having heard oral evidence from DW and the Respondent on aspects in dispute. In this respect, her Honour accepted the evidence of DW where it was in conflict with that of the Respondent and made findings to the criminal standard based upon acceptance of DW's evidence. 

35The Respondent was born in July 1964 and was 44 years' old at the time of the offences. The Respondent has never held a licence to drive a motor vehicle. He had held a rider's licence between 1983 and 1987. 

36In January 2009, the Respondent was working as a tyre fitter at JAXQuickfit Tyres at Campbelltown. He was living at Ingleburn. He had separated from his partner in 2006. There were four children of the relationship, including MB and JB. 

37On 23 January 2008, the Respondent appeared at the Campbelltown Local Court upon a number of charges. For an offence of driving a vehicle in a manner dangerous, he was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service and was disqualified from driving for 18 months, commencing on 22 January 2008 and expiring on 21 July 2009. He was fined for offences of driving a vehicle on a road having never been licensed, and for not stopping a vehicle when directed to do so. 

38Between 1.30 pm on Saturday 17 January 2009 and 12.55 pm on 18 January 2009, the Respondent took possession of a 2001 Ford utility from his place of work at Campbelltown. The vehicle was a company vehicle and could not be used by any employee without the written permission of the employer. The Respondent had no such permission (Count 1). 

39About 12.55 pm on Sunday, 18 January 2009, the Respondent was driving the Ford utility on Argyle Street, Moss Vale. His youngest son, MB (then aged 15 years), saw him and requested a ride home. At that time, MB was in the company of his friend, DW (also 15 years' old), who also requested a ride home. The Respondent firstly collected his eldest son, JB (then aged 18 years), from another location in Moss Vale before returning to Argyle Street, where MB and DW were waiting. 

40The Ford utility was fitted with two bucket-style seats. The Respondent occupied the driver's seat and JB sat in the front passenger seat. MB sat in the area behind the front seats. DW sat next to the Respondent in the space in between the two seats. Accordingly, the Respondent set off on the journey towards New Berrima with only himself and JB occupying seats with seat belts. MB and DW were not seated and were unsecured in the cabin of the vehicle. 

41The Respondent told the District Court that, in the period prior to the collision, he had consumed three stubbies of beer. One was consumed at work, the second was consumed en route from Campbelltown to the Southern Highlands and the third was partially consumed after the Respondent had arrived in the vicinity of Moss Vale, shortly before he picked up his sons and DW. 

42The vehicle proceeded along Berrima Road, Moss Vale towards New Berrima in an area where a 70 km per hour speed zone applied. 

43It was the evidence of DW, accepted by her Honour, that as the vehicle proceeded along Berrima Road, it was travelling at what DW described as a ""normal speed"" . However, the vehicle then overtook three cars ""on the straight"" and, in the course of overtaking those vehicles, the Respondent's vehicle reached about 130 kms per hour to 140 kms per hour. As DW was seated in the console area, he had a clear view of the speedometer. He described the speed as being ""way over"" the speed limit. 

44It was DW's evidence, again accepted by her Honour, that he asked the Respondent to slow down. He made that request three or four times whilst the vehicle was overtaking the other three vehicles. He first asked the Respondent to ""slow down a bit"" . When the Respondent did not slow down, he repeated his request and then he said ""stop the car so I can get out"" . DW was particularly concerned because he knew that the vehicle was approaching a ""blind corner"" and, according to DW, the Respondent had ""left it a bit late on a blind corner"" . DW stated that the Respondent's vehicle ""had just returned to the correct side of the road when we got to the blind corner"" . DW's next recollection was waking up in hospital when he regained consciousness from a coma about three weeks later. 

45The Respondent's vehicle was seen by witnesses to be driving at high speed and, when rounding a slight right-hand bend about 100 metres west of Brookdale Road, near the Moss Vale Sale Yards, the vehicle commenced to rotate clockwise with the passenger side leading, crossing on to the incorrect side of the road, through a fence into a paddock, through another fence, along a dam embankment before colliding with a tree and rolling on to its roof. As a result of the impact, the tree was uprooted. 

46The place where the Respondent lost control of the vehicle, Berrima Road, Moss Vale, comprised one lane in each direction, separated by a double unbroken white line. On either side of the lanes of traffic was a white continuous edge line. The road surface was sealed and in good condition. The weather at the time was fine and sunny. 

47Detective Senior Constable Robert Burlin, of the Southern Region Crash Investigation Unit, expressed the opinion, which was accepted by her Honour, that the Respondent's vehicle was travelling at a minimum speed of 113.39 kms per hour when it entered the yaw, a term applied to a sideways movement of a vehicle, such as occurs when the rear of the vehicle rounding a corner, side slips and moves out from the curved path in which it has been moving, so that the vehicle revolves around the centre of mass. 

48As a result of the collision, the three passengers were trapped inside the vehicle. They were assisted by other drivers who stopped to help. 

49JB and DW were flown to Royal North Shore Hospital by Air Ambulance. MB was flown by Air Ambulance to Liverpool Hospital. 

50The Respondent had a number of superficial injuries and was taken to Bowral Hospital for treatment and mandatory blood and urine samples were taken. 

51Thereafter, the Respondent returned to the Bowral Police Station and participated in an ERISP. In the interview, he stated to police that he was travelling at 70 kms per hour and, as he entered the corner, the vehicle struck something, such as a rock, or dropped a wheel off the roadway, and then fishtailed and lost control. 

52Dr Judith Perl, pharmacologist with the Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit of the New South Wales Police Force, expressed the opinion that the Respondent's blood alcohol concentration at the time of the collision would have been not less than 0.092 grams per hundred millilitres of blood. The sentencing Judge accepted that a blood alcohol concentration of 0.092 evidenced impairment of skills in relation to emergency reaction and complex skills and impairment of some general driving skills, so that the Respondent's driving capacity was significantly impaired. 

53Her Honour inferred that the impairment was likely to manifest itself when he was driving at speed and was called upon to react quickly, as occurred in this case. 

Injuries Suffered by the Victims 

54There was a substantial volume of documentary medical evidence tendered at the sentencing hearing concerning the injuries sustained in the collision by MB, JB and DW. 

55Her Honour made the following findings concerning JB's injuries (ROS, paragraph 24): 

""As a result of the collision, [JB] suffered a traumatic amputation of the left arm at the level of his humoral diaphysis, ie above the elbow, and a right elbow fracture. He has undergone multiple surgeries for his injuries. There is no evidence as to [JB's] current circumstances, but I can only assume that he has been left very significantly disabled as a consequence of the effective loss of his left arm. The offender did volunteer that [JB] was left handed, but will overlook that statement in the absence of confirmation from him or a medical practitioner."" 

56The following findings were made concerning MB's injuries (ROS, paragraph 25): 

""As far as [MB] is concerned he was the least injured. He suffered a damaged ulna nerve in the left arm, a fractured sternum, a fractured scapula and four fractured vertebrae as well as a collapsed lung. Fortunately, the only ongoing disability is some nerve damage to the left arm which results in some sensory interference, sensations of numbness and the like, in more than one finger in the left hand. As at February 2009 he had decreased sensation over the left little and ring fingers and over the ulna aspect of the left hand. He was left with some weakness in the abduction/adduction of the fingers of the left hand. Otherwise, his muscular power and sensation was normal in all limbs. Fortunately for [MB] , in terms of his physical injuries in any event, he escaped relatively unscathed."" 

57Her Honour then turned to the devastating injuries sustained by DW (ROS, paragraph 26): 

""Unfortunately for [DW] his life has been completed devastated as a result of the injuries that he sustained. [DW] had serious spinal injuries and he has been classified as a C2 tetraplegic. He was in a coma for a long time. He then underwent rehabilitation. There have been multiple surgical interventions, but he is left with extremely serious disabilities. He is confined to a wheelchair. The report that is in highly technical terms, so it is somewhat difficult to follow. However, I gather that [DW] is permanently confined to a wheelchair and has been deprived of the effective use of all four limbs. The reports, or perhaps it was the Victim Impact Statement, referred to difficulty in communication, but that difficulty must have been addressed to a large extent because he was able to verbally communicate on the AVL link. I do not know whether that was painful to him but he was able to communicate quite clearly on that link. However, he was a very independent young man at the time of the accident. He had employment and he was looking forward to a bright future. He is now entirely dependent on others, not only in relation to outdoor activities, but in relation to his personal activities, showering, toileting and matters of that type He has carers in addition to his family. His daily routine is described in the Victim Impact Statement. It is quite unenviable. His house has required renovations. He will never be able to go upstairs because he is confined to the wheel chair. He is acutely aware of the impact of his disabilities on his family. His parents have become his full time carers and his siblings are also deeply affected. His friends are finding it difficult to cope with the extent of [DW's] injuries. For that reason, they have not been providing him with full support. That is all quite understandable. He also sees his friends moving on with their lives and he is aware that that is what he should be doing. He tries to stay positive, but the accident has had a devastating impact on [DW] . The Court acknowledges that and it also acknowledges his courage in facing the future."" 

58In addition to the matters mentioned by the sentencing Judge, the Victim Impact Statement of DW prepared on 12 May 2010 (when DW was 16 years' old) referred to other consequences of his injuries. DW had been a successful football player and had been ready to join a team in Moss Vale. He had just obtained permanent employment and was thinking about joining the armed forces. These possibilities no longer exist. The demands upon his parents because of his care needs had affected detrimentally the support and assistance which his parents could give to his older brother and sister and his younger sister. The direct and indirect physical, mental and social consequences experienced by DW and his family, as the result of the Respondent's criminal conduct, are very great. 

59Her Honour summarised the injuries sustained by each of the three victims, and their consequences, in the following way (ROS, paragraph 27): 

""The injuries to [DW] are vastly worse than those to [MB]. [JB] also sustained a very serious and permanent disability that will impact upon him, not only in relation to his personal life but, potentially, on his employment prospects."" 

60It was an element of each of the second, third and fourth counts that MB, JB and DW had suffered grievous bodily harm. Section 4(1) Crimes Act 1900 defines ""grievous bodily harm"" to include any permanent or serious disfiguring of the person, the destruction of a foetus and any grievous bodily disease. At common law, the words ""grievous bodily harm"" are given their ordinary natural meaning. ""Bodily harm"" needs no explanation and ""grievous"" simply means ""really serious"" : Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 209; 188 A Crim R 331 at 356 [137], 360 [160]-[162]. 

61In R v Dutton [2005] NSWCCA 248, Howie J (Studdert and Kirby JJ agreeing) observed at [30], in the context of a s.52A offence, that the loss of a hand was ""grievous bodily harm of a very high order"" and that there ""can be cases of course where the injury is worse but then the penalty would approach closer to the maximum than a sentence of imprisonment [in that case] for two years"". 

62That each of the three young men had suffered grievous bodily harm was admitted by the Respondent's pleas of guilty. However, the profound and permanent injury sustained by DW placed that offence close to, if not at, the top of the range of grievous bodily harm encompassed by the section. The substantial maiming of JB, involving loss of an arm, constituted a very serious and permanent disability. The fact that the injuries sustained by MB were not as grave and far reaching as those suffered by DW and JB does not detract from the seriousness of those injuries. 

63These offences involved grave injuries to three individuals who will suffer the consequences, in a multitude of ways, for the rest of their lives. 

64The gravity of the injuries suffered by the victims will be mentioned again in the context of accumulation of sentences and totality. 

The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances 

65As mentioned earlier, the Respondent was 44 years' old at the time of the offences and 46 years' old at the time of sentence. 

66The Respondent's criminal history included entries for break, enter and steal (fined in 1988) and assault (placed on a bond in 1992). 

67The Respondent was convicted, fined and disqualified at the Southport Magistrates Court in 2004 for traffic matters and was placed on a suspended sentence for a domestic violence offence at the same Court in 2006. 

68As mentioned earlier (at [37]), the Respondent was sentenced to undertake community service and was disqualified from driving at the Campbelltown Local Court on 23 January 2008. 

69As mentioned at [35] above, the Respondent has never held a licence to drive a motor vehicle and held a rider's licence only between 1983 and 1987. His traffic record reveals two infringements for negligent driving (in 1983 and 1985) and nine speeding offences (between 1984 and 1986). 

70In evidence before the sentencing Judge were a presentence report dated 8 April 2010, a report of Dr Michael Giuffrida, forensic psychiatrist, dated 14 May 2010 and references from the Respondent's employers in the tyre service industry in 2009 and 2010. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the Respondent gave evidence at the sentencing hearing, as did his sister, who was employed as a disability worker. This evidence traversed the Respondent's personal background and history. 

71The sentencing Judge adverted to this evidence, and the Respondent's personal history (ROS, paragraphs 30-32): 

""30. The offender is a rather a [sic] difficult person to fathom. He gave evidence. His sister gave evidence. Her evidence was extremely helpful. A report was tendered from a psychiatrist, who had not managed to sort things out. He simply described the offender as 'obviously depressed' and, generally speaking, described the fact that the offender would not open up to the psychiatrist. That was of minimal use. It appears through the evidence of the offender's sister that they both came from a very violent household. The offender's father was a very violent man. There was constant domestic violence in the household, which was primarily directed at the offender's mother and the offender himself, rather than the sisters. One incident described by the sister (which was not witnessed by the offender, but is indicative of the level of violence in the household) was that, when the mother was pregnant, the offender's father threw boiling water over her, resulting in premature labour and the birth of one of the offender's sisters with a disability, inferentially related to the fact that her mother had gone into premature labour because of the father's conduct. The offender's sister said that the offender was always very nervous around his father and that the offender's father would beat the offender for no apparent reason. He was kicked. He was thrown across rooms. He received bleeding noses and bruises. This sort of behaviour was perpetrated against the offender from when the offender was seven or eight years of age until he reached his teens and the parents separated. The whole family, in effect, walked on egg shells through the offender's childhood. The offender performed poorly at school. He engaged in dangerous behaviour such as climbing on roofs. He started drinking in his pre-teen years. 

31. According to his sister, the offender has turned to drink and become very withdrawn. He drinks and withdraws into himself rather than discussing his problems. That was demonstrated in the offenders failure to disclose important matters to the author of the pre-sentence report and psychiatrist who was trying to prepare a report to help him. The offender's sister described her observation that the offender, appeared to be suicidal after the accident. The family insisted that he move to live with them. They did not want him living alone because they feared that he might take his own life. 

32. The offender's evidence accorded with that of his sister, although he did not describe the violence within the household. He informed the Court the psychiatrist, that he does not remember anything about his life before he was ten years of age. The inference is that the offender has suppressed his memory of that part of his life because his primary memory was of being assaulted by his father."" 

72Her Honour turned to the issue of remorse, before returning to other features relevant to the case (ROS, paragraphs 33-34): 

""33. As far as the accident is concerned, there is no doubt that the offender is extremely remorseful. Not only in relation to the impact on his own children, but also in relation to the impact on- [DW]. His words were, 'I wish I had died in the accident' because of the injuries that he caused to [DW] and to his two sons. That was not just an expression. Based on the evidence of the sister, it seems to be the literal truth. The offender is certainly remorseful within the meaning of s 21 (A)(3). 

34. Currently, the offender is not seeing any of his children, except [JB] , whom the sister takes to visit him in gaol. He has a responsible position as a sweeper in gaol. He is quite content to serve a sentence of imprisonment because he believes that he deserves it. When he is released, the offender intends to live with his mother and sister. He has good employment prospects. References have been tendered to the effect that he is a very good worker, very reliable and honest. There is no doubt that he will be able to return to a good situation of employment upon his release. The offender presents as someone with two very serious issues that need to be addressed. The first is his very deep seated psychological problems as a result of childhood abuse, and the second is his related alcoholism."" 

Some Further Findings of the Sentencing Judge 

73Her Honour had regard to sentencing factors identified in the decision of this Court in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252. Her Honour accepted the Crown submission and found that a ""high level of moral culpability"" was involved and that sentences to be imposed should reflect that finding (ROS, paragraph 36). 

74Her Honour made the following findings (ROS, paragraph 43): 

""I must consider the sentencing purposes in s 3A. For offences of this type, considerations of general deterrence, accountability, denunciation and recognition of harm to the victims and the community are always very important and that is certainly true in this case. I do not believe that personal deterrence is an important consideration in this case. I do not think the length of sentence will have any impact on the offender. The fact that the incident occurred is what will weigh with him more than anything else. The consideration of adequate punishment is relevant. I also need to consider the question of rehabilitation of the offender. He is somebody who is in need of rehabilitation in relation to his alcoholism and underlying problems related to childhood abuse."" 

75Her Honour then turned to aggravating and mitigating factors in s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (ROS, paragraph 44): 

""I need to consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating features in s 21A of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Although this is a matter of common sense, I am not taking these matters into account by way of double counting the aggravating features and other features referred to in the guideline judgment. As far as aggravating features are concerned, there is the criminal history, in particular the drive manner dangerous for which he was sentenced in January 2008. There is the consideration in relation to [DW] , s1A, (2)(g), the injury was substantial. Any grievous bodily harm is a substantial injury, but within grievous bodily harm there are a range of injuries and the injury to [DW] was very much at the upper end of that range, not only because of the nature of the injury but because it happened to a boy who was only about fifteen or sixteen years old at the time and upon whom the accident will impact for many, many decades. On the other hand, in relation to [MB] , the injury was towards the lower end of the range in terms of grievous bodily harm. I would not describe it as 'not substantial' within s 21A(3), but it is a factor to be taken into account in the sentencing of the offence concerning [MB]. Factors under s 21 A(3) are the (h), the prospects of rehabilitation. I do not know that I would describe them as good, but I would describe them as reasonable because the impact of the offence, of incarceration, the realisation of the harm that he has caused, will very likely cause the offender to look closely at his underlying problems and his alcohol problem. I have already noted that I accept that he is remorseful within the meaning of s 21A(3)(i) and I have noted the plea of guilty."" 

76The sentencing Judge adverted to the s.154A(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 offence (ROS, paragraph 45): 

""So far, I have said nothing about the take and drive matter. There was no explanation for why the offender took the vehicle. None was advanced. On the other hand, the offender does not have a record for dishonesty. There is a very minor matter a couple of decades ago, which resulted in a fine. In effect, this is his first matter of dishonesty. The taking was from an employer, someone in relation to whom the offender had a position of trust. That is a consideration in respect of the take and drive matter."" 

77Before passing sentence upon the Respondent, her Honour addressed the issues of ""special circumstances"" and accumulation of sentences in the following way (ROS, paragraph 46): 

""It has been submitted that there are special circumstances that I should take into account in varying the usual relationship between the head sentence and the non parole period. I agree with that submission. The special circumstances that I take into account are partial accumulation of sentences, first time in prison and the need for a lengthy period of support through rehabilitation in relation to alcohol and psychiatric/psychological issues."" 

78Her Honour then imposed the sentences referred to earlier in this judgment, explaining that the ""non-parole period of 27 June 2012 applies in relation to the offences involving [JB] and [DW] because they are the sentences which extend beyond that date"" (ROS, paragraph 47). 

The Crown Appeal 

79As the grounds of appeal makes clear, the Crown appeal challenges the degree of concurrency of the individual sentences, with the result that the non-parole period and total effective sentence did not adequately reflect the total criminality revealed by the Respondent's offences. 

80Apart from Ground 1A, added by leave at the hearing of the appeal, there was no challenge to the individual sentences for each offence. If the Court determines to intervene and resentence the Respondent upon the primary grounds of appeal, the technical issue raised by Ground 1A will not require further attention. 

Submissions of the Crown 

81The Crown pointed to the finding of the sentencing Judge that the Respondent's moral culpability was high, a finding that was not challenged on appeal. The Crown submitted that this conclusion was inevitable given the mature age of the Respondent, the speed at which the Respondent was driving, both before and at the time that he lost control of the vehicle and his intoxication. Further, the Crown submitted that the fact that the Respondent knew that two of the child passengers were not sitting in seats within the vehicle and were not wearing seatbelts (itself an offence) constituted a further highly aggravating feature that greatly increased his moral culpability: R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [26]. 

82Further, DW was a stranger to the Respondent and this did not assist the Respondent on sentence: Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48; 185 A Crim R 155 at 160 [23]. 

83The Crown submitted that not only was the Respondent's moral culpability high in respect of all three offences, but that the objective seriousness of the offences was greater than that considered in the guideline judgment in R v Whyte , by virtue of the number of victims and the very severe and permanent injuries sustained by two of the victims. In particular, in light of the total and permanent disabilities sustained by DW, the Crown submitted that the offence against him was arguably in the worst-case category of offences of this kind, bearing in mind that this was not the aggravated form of offence under s.52A Crimes Act 1900 . 

84Given the sentencing Judge's finding on moral culpability, and the other aggravating factors present, the Crown submitted that the head sentences imposed were lenient. It was submitted that her Honour appeared to have approached the guideline judgment in R v Whyte as establishing a norm above and below which the sentences should be ordered. 

85The Crown submitted that the offence involving MB had, as a starting point on sentence, a period of 24 months, the sentence identified by Spigelman CJ in R v Whyte as being appropriate in a case where there were no such aggravating features. 

86The Crown submitted that the starting point for the offence involving JB was a period of 32 months, despite the very serious and permanent injury suffered by JB and the presence of other aggravating factors. 

87With respect to the offence involving DW, the Crown submitted that the starting point was a period of 48 months, only twice that identified in R v Whyte and only minimally over 50% of the maximum penalty, despite it being arguably an example of the worst case of an offence of its kind. 

88The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge also adopted an unjustifiably lenient approach to considerations of personal deterrence. It was observed that her Honour was clearly impressed by the Respondent's deep remorse, as a result of which she concluded that personal deterrence was not an important consideration in the case (ROS, paragraph 43). However, the Crown submitted that such a conclusion failed to take proper account of the Respondent's history of driving offences. For many years, the Respondent had repeatedly driven without a licence and he had been convicted on three prior occasions of driving negligently or driving in a manner dangerous. In 2008, the Respondent had been sentenced to 200 hours community service for such an offence. He has been charged nine times with speeding offences. 

89On this occasion, the Crown submitted that he stole a vehicle, overloaded it with children and drove it, intoxicated, in a manner dangerous. The Respondent's driving history demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience for the law and a complete disregard for other users of the road. Notwithstanding the Respondent's feeling of guilt and contrition, the Crown submitted that considerations of personal deterrence remained relevant in the sentencing process. 

90Whilst the Crown did not submit that the individual head sentences themselves were manifestly inadequate in the sense that they are plainly unjust or unreasonable, it was submitted that the leniency shown to the Respondent in the fixing of the head sentences, when combined with the inadequacy of the accumulation, resulted in an overall head sentence that was manifestly inadequate. 

91Whilst acknowledging that questions of accumulation and concurrency are discretionary, as to which there is no single correct answer, the Crown submitted that the real issue is whether the effective total non-parole period and head sentence properly reflected the Respondent's criminality, taking into account all the circumstances. 

92It was submitted that, in sentencing for multiple offences of dangerous driving, appropriate regard must be paid to the consequences of the Respondent's acts and that, in terms of seriousness, the greater the number of persons injured, the graver the crime becomes: R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288; 44 MVR 328 at [23]. 

93The Crown submitted that the degree of accumulation imposed here, being three-month increments for each of the offences relating to JB and DW, did not reflect the criminality of the Respondent's conduct and, in particular, did not sufficiently acknowledge the devastating injuries suffered by DW. 

94Further, the Crown submitted that such minimal increments did not properly reflect the sentencing Judge's findings that each of the offences involved a high degree of moral culpability and had resulted in injuries that were at ""the upper end of the range"" of seriousness. 

95Even when regard is had to the principle of totality, the Crown submitted that increments of three months did not comprehend the criminality involved in the offending against each of these three young men. It was submitted that this is illustrated by the fact that the non-parole period fixed will result in the Respondent being eligible for release to parole after only serving 50% of the sentence imposed with respect to the offence against DW. 

96The Crown submitted that, in the circumstances, the sentences were inadequate having regard to the seriousness of the driving, its consequences and in light of the Respondent's record, so that error had been demonstrated and the Respondent should be resentenced. 
 
The Respondent's Submissions 

97Mr Corr, counsel for the Respondent, submitted that her Honour had imposed a measure of accumulation for each offence and that error had not been demonstrated in this discretionary sentencing process. 

98Mr Corr submitted that the findings of the sentencing Judge concerning the Respondent's remorse and contrition operated, as her Honour held, to reduce the significance of personal deterrence on sentence. He submitted that this approach was open to the sentencing Judge. 

99Mr Corr submitted that there ought be no effective increase in the non-parole period and full-term component of the sentences. 

Resolution of Competing Submissions 

100At the forefront of this appeal is the need to keep in mind the fact that the Respondent's grossly irresponsible driving involved three separate crimes, committed against three separate victims with grave consequences to each of them and, in particular, to DW. 

101In R v Scott [1999] NSWCCA 233, Levine J (Carruthers AJ agreeing) said at [17]: 

""Offences under s52A are public offences. Everyone has some idea of what they are about. Everyone is involved as a driver, passenger or pedestrian with what goes on on the highways and streets of this State. It is a very public crime. The public are entitled to have sentences imposed that make it perfectly clear that conduct of this kind in an environment in which so many of the public are involved in their daily affairs, will be appropriately punished."" 

102It is the unfortunate fact that offences under s.52A Crimes Act 1900 can cause death or serious injury to persons in the driver's vehicle, in other vehicles which happen to be in or near the street at the time, or to pedestrians unlucky enough to be in the area when the offence is committed. The lethal or potentially lethal consequences of s.52A offences mean that relatives or friends of an offender, or complete strangers, may be killed or injured through the course of driving which constitutes the offence. 

103It is important that the guideline judgment in R v Whyte does not become the undue focus of attention on the part of a sentencing Judge, with less attention being paid to the maximum penalty for each offence (in this case imprisonment for seven years). The guideline is a ""guide"" or ""check"" with the sentence to be imposed to be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all relevant factors, including the maximum penalty: R v Whyte at 288 [232]. As Spigelman CJ said in Legge v R [2007] NSWCCA 244 at [59], ""a guideline is not a tramline"" . 

104The Crown submission that the offence involving DW is close to a worst-category offence of this kind is correct. The driving of the Respondent, as the sentencing Judge found, involved a high level of moral culpability. Added to this were the devastating consequences for DW, a teenager whose life has been altered profoundly. It is difficult to envisage a more serious example of ""grievous bodily harm"" than that relating to DW. It was and remains important that the grave seriousness of the Respondent's crime against DW be marked by a significant period of imprisonment referrable to that offence alone. 

105The offence against the Respondent's son, JB, also caused serious and permanent injury and disability. It was necessary that there be a significant and identifiable period of imprisonment referrable to the offence against JB. 

106On the scale of injuries in this case, the offence against MB involved the least serious injuries. It was important, however, that the sentencing process did not dilute the objective seriousness of the offence against MB, who sustained significant and serious injuries. Once again, a separate and identifiable period of imprisonment was necessary with respect to this offence. 

107Relevant to sentence for the offence against DW is the fact that the Respondent had responsibility for a teenage friend of his own son, whom he carried as a passenger in the vehicle. Further, the fact that the Respondent drove the vehicle in this manner with four persons in the cabin, which contained only two seats, was a serious aggravating factor on sentence. Two of the young persons were not only unseated, but without seatbelts at a time when the Respondent drove in this dangerous fashion. The number of persons put at risk is a relevant aggravating factor, and the Respondent knew that two of the passengers were neither seated nor secured by seat belts: R v Berg at [26]. A driver is responsible for the safety of his passengers, including the need to ensure they are seated and secured by seat belts: R v Dutton at [36]. 

108The s.52A offences tend to overwhelm the offence concerning the vehicle under s.154A Crimes Act 1900 . It is important, however, that that offence not be effectively sidelined in the sentencing process. 

109The Respondent was not a young person who took a vehicle on a joy ride with friends, leading to an accident with tragic consequences. The Respondent was a mature man, aged 44 years, who (for reasons that remain unexplained) took a work vehicle without permission and then, whilst driving two of his sons and a teenage friend, drove the vehicle in an extraordinary fashion whilst they were vulnerable and exposed to great risk of harm. All of this occurred, of course, after the Respondent had been consuming alcohol which affected him to some extent. 

110In reality, the Respondent had few factors operating in his favour on sentence. Reference has already been made to the 25% discount for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty, a generous discount in the circumstances of this case, with which this Court cannot interfere. 

111The Respondent's history of persistent driving, and driving offences whilst unlicensed, was a significant factor which ought to have operated against him on sentence. The sentencing Judge observed (ROS, paragraph 29) that the fact that the Respondent was disqualified from driving at the time of the offences could not bear upon the objective gravity of the offences, although being relevant to issues of personal and general deterrence: Rosenthal v R [2008] NSWCCA 149 at [16]-[17]. 

112In the context of sentencing for this class of offence, this Court has said that a licence to drive a motor vehicle is a privilege which carries with it significant obligations to drive safely and not to endanger the lives of others: Gillett v R [2006] NSWCCA 370; 166 A Crim R 419 at 437-438 [47]. The Respondent had never been licensed to drive a motor vehicle and was a disqualified driver at the time of these offences. Far from being privileged to drive as a licensed driver, he was prohibited by law from driving. His driving history, and status as a disqualified driver, indicated an attitude of disobedience to the law and required that increased weight be given on sentence to issues of retribution and personal deterrence: R v Nguyen [2008] NSWCCA 113 at [51]. 

113However, as set out at [74] above, her Honour appears to have placed personal deterrence to one side because of the Respondent's feelings of remorse for what he had done. In my view, this approach was unduly favourable to the Respondent and was erroneous. 

114It might be expected that a person who commits this class of offence, where family members and acquaintances are seriously injured, will feel great sorrow for their actions. Indeed, if those feelings were absent, there would be significant psychological and behavioural issues arising for consideration. 

115The fact that the Respondent had responded to the offences in the way he did could not, in my view, operate so as to reduce significantly the role of personal deterrence in this case. In R v Koosmen [2004] NSWCCA 359, Smart AJA (Wood CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing), in the context of a sentence appeal with respect to an offence of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor occasioning death, observed at [32]: 

"" Dhanhoa [[2000] NSWCCA 257] is authority for the proposition that the effect of the death in the accident on the offender and self punishment (the self inflicted sense of shame and guilt) were often highly relevant factors, that the weight to be given to these depended on the circumstances and that different judges may give different weight to those factors. Where the facts reveal gross moral culpability judges should be wary of attaching too much weight to considerations of self punishment. Genuine remorse and self punishment do not compensate for or balance out gross moral culpability."" 


116The principles expressed in R v Koosmen have particular application in a case such as this, where personal deterrence is a critical consideration on sentence, given the Respondent's long-term (if not lifetime) disregard for driver licensing laws. The Respondent has committed offences repeatedly when unlicensed, culminating in a serious offence in 2008 for which a community service order was imposed, together with a period of disqualification. Yet the Respondent drove again on this occasion, in the criminal manner which gave rise to these offences. The Respondent's feelings of shame, guilt and self punishment, could not remove the need for a significant element on sentence for personal deterrence and retribution. In addition, general deterrence remained as an important consideration on sentence. 

117Hunt AJA (Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreeing), in R v Janceski at 333 [23], referred to principles concerning concurrency and accumulation in the context of offences where a number of people are injured in a motor vehicle collision, and where separate charges are laid in relation to each victim: 

""In a case falling within the second sub-category, separate sentences should usually be fixed which are made partly concurrent and partly cumulative, each such sentence being appropriate to the existence of only one victim and the aggregate of the sentences reflecting the fact that there are multiple victims resulting from the same action by the offender. The extent to which there should be an overlap in the partial accumulation will depend on what is required to represent the totality of the criminality involved in the one act of the offender."" 

118General sentencing principles with respect to accumulation, concurrency and totality were expressed by Howie J (Price J agreeing) in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27]: 

""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both."" 

119In Cahyadi v R , Howie J referred at 47 [28] to the decision in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 481 where the Court (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ) said at 486 [13]: 

""In some cases the fact that a sentence for a particular offence is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence will result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender was to be punished for the two acts of offending: see for example R v Brown [1999] NSWCCA 323. This may be so even if the two offences arise from the same precise criminal act, such as the dangerous driving of a motor vehicle on the one occasion: R v Janceski (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 288. The same principle has been applied to sexual assault offences arising from a single incident of sexual assault: R v Gorman (2002) 137 A Crim R 326. Although, it has been held that a determination of the extent, if any, that a sentence is to be served cumulatively with another sentence is an exercise of discretion on which minds might differ, R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66, that discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality."" 

120The principle of totality is not unrelated to the principle of proportionality: R v MMK at 486 [11]. A sentencing Court must take care when applying the totality principle, with public confidence in the administration of justice requiring the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of a discount for multiple offending: R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at 164-165 [18]. 

121It has been demonstrated that the sentencing Judge in this case, in determining issues of accumulation and totality, did not apply relevant principles so as to ensure that the objective gravity of the Respondent's offences were reflected appropriately in the non-parole period and the effective head sentence to be served for the offences. Significantly inadequate accumulation was ordered so that the sentences imposed for discrete offences were accompanied by minimal increments. In reality, the sentences imposed for the offences were close to being concurrent, with only minimal overlap by way of accumulation. 

122The explanation for this conclusion appears to flow from inadequate attention being paid to the maximum penalties for the offences, together with certain subjective features of the Respondent's case (his troubled upbringing in a destructive household) being taken into account in a manner which diverted the sentencing Court from imposing sentences which adequately reflected his objectively serious crimes: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. The Respondent's troubled family history could have only a limited role to play on sentence for crimes committed when he was 44 years' old, with a lengthy history of disobedience to the traffic laws, and with his offences involving high moral culpability and grave injury to the three young victims. 

123In my view, error has been established in the sentencing process with respect to accumulation, concurrency and totality. 

124The Crown has established that the measure of accumulation as between the offences in this case was manifestly inadequate, with the consequence that the total effective non-parole period and the total effective sentence are manifestly inadequate. It has been demonstrated that the non-parole period and head sentence are unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. 

125This Court retains a discretion whether to resentence a respondent on a Crown appeal: R v JW at 33 [150]. However, no discretionary basis has been demonstrated for the Court to decline to resentence in this case. 

Resentencing the Respondent 

126If the point was reached where the Court determined to resentence the Respondent, the Court was asked to take into account an affidavit of the Respondent sworn 11 August 2011 which outlined his current custodial status and his plans upon release. I have had regard to that affidavit for the purpose of resentencing the Respondent. 

127As this Court is to resentence the Respondent at this time, the aggregate sentencing provisions in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 are available for use by this Court on appeal. 

128Consistent with the manner in which the appeal was argued by the Crown, this Court should not increase the individual sentences to be served on each of the four counts. The appropriate sentencing outcome should be reached by varying the orders for accumulation and by increasing the non-parole period to be served by the Respondent. 

129The effective sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge comprised a non-parole period of two years and one month with an effective head sentence of three years and seven months. For reasons disclosed in this judgment, that outcome is manifestly inadequate. 

130In determining questions of accumulation, concurrency and totality, the Court has regard to all factors relevant to sentence, including the objective gravity of the offences, the Respondent's subjective circumstances, and the need for retribution, and personal and general deterrence to be reflected on sentence, whilst continuing to allow the Respondent the 25% discount for his pleas of guilty in the District Court. 

131The non-parole period to be set ought reflect the minimum period of actual incarceration that the Respondent must spend in full-time custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment including the objective gravity of the offences, the Respondent's subjective circumstances, rehabilitation, and personal and general deterrence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 716-717 [55]-[58]. The non-parole period must reflect adequately the objective seriousness of the offences and the necessary punitive considerations: R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92; 145 A Crim R 434 at 440 [34]. 

132With respect to the first count, a fixed term of imprisonment for three months was imposed. I note that her Honour was misinformed by the Crown that the maximum penalty for that offence was imprisonment for two years (AB32), when the maximum penalty was in fact imprisonment for five years: ss.117, 154A Crimes Act 1900 . On appeal, the Crown acknowledged that this error had been made, and accepted that the Court should not take it into account given that the District Court had been led into error in this respect by the Crown: R v JW at 33 [149]. 

133The real issues ventilated on appeal concerned the approach to sentencing for the s.52A offences. 

134The sentencing Judge's measure of accumulation of one month, as between the first and second counts, should remain. 

135The sentence for the second count (the offence involving MB) was one of imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months. The sentence on the third count (the offence involving JB) involved a fixed term of imprisonment for two years. Having regard to the conclusions reached on appeal, accumulation for a period of one year and three months is appropriate as between these offences. 

136The sentence on the fourth count (the offence involving DW) was one of imprisonment for three years. Accumulation for a period of two years and three months is appropriate as between the third and fourth count. 

137Aggregation of these sentences in this way under s.53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 will see a total head sentence of six years and seven months commencing on 28 May 2010 and expiring on 27 December 2016. 

138Where a single non-parole period is fixed for an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, the usual statutory formula applies as well, with the Court required to give reasons for varying the ratio after a finding of special circumstances: s.44(2B) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

139If the statutory formula in s.44(2B) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was applied to this head sentence, a non-parole period of four years, 11 months and one week would result. The sentencing Judge identified the special circumstances in this case as being the partial accumulation of sentences, the fact that it was the Respondent's first time in prison and the need for a lengthy period of support through rehabilitation in relation to alcohol and psychiatric/psychological issues (ROS, paragraph 46), set out at [77] above. 

140It is important that the sentencing process does not see double counting of subjective factors, so as to reduce the overall sentence, and then to operate again to reduce the term of the non-parole period: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18]. 

141The non-parole period should not fall below that which is appropriate, having regard to the objective gravity of the Respondent's crimes. In my view, a non-parole period of four years and nine months is the minimum period which the Respondent should be required to serve in the circumstances of the case. This reflects a modest variation for special circumstances, being the Respondent's need for extended support upon release. If the Respondent is released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period, these orders will allow for a substantial period of conditional liberty to aid his rehabilitation. 

142For the purposes of s.53A(2)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , I record the fact that an aggregate sentence should be imposed in this case. For the purposes of s.53A(2)(b) of that Act, I record that the fixed-term sentences referred to at [132], [135]-[136] above constitute the sentences that would have been imposed for each offence, had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. 

143I propose that an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of six years and seven months be imposed for the offences comprised in the first, second, third and fourth counts. A single non-parole period of four years and nine months is appropriate in the circumstances of the case. 

Orders 

144I propose the following orders: 

(a) Crown appeal allowed; 

(b) sentences imposed in the District Court on 9 March 2011 with respect to the first, second, third and fourth counts are quashed; 

(c) in their place, the Respondent is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of six years and seven months commencing on 28 May 2010 and expiring on 27 December 2016; 

(d) a single non-parole period of four years and nine months is fixed commencing on 28 May 2010 and expiring on 27 February 2015; 

(e) the sentence imposed in the District Court on 9 March 2011 for the offence of driving whilst disqualified, pursuant to a certificate under s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 , is confirmed; 

(f) the orders for disqualification made in the District Court on 9 March 2011 are confirmed; 

(e) the earliest date upon which the Respondent will be eligible for release on parole is 28 February 2015.

2709038,Daniel Michael Horne v R [2011] NSWCCA 225,"Judgment  1BATHURST CJ: I agree with the judgment of James J.  2JAMES J: Daniel Michael Horne applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Lakatos.  3The applicant was sentenced for a very large number of offences, to all of which he had pleaded guilty, consisting of:-  Three offences of obtaining money by deception ( Crimes Act s178BA, since repealed).  One offence of participating in a criminal group ( Crimes Act s 93T).  Two offences of using a false instrument ( Crimes Act s 300(2), since repealed).  In sentencing the applicant for one of these offences the sentencing judge took into account 84 offences of obtaining money by deception, using a false instrument or recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime.  Two offences of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime ( Crimes Act s 193B(3))  One offence of making a false instrument ( Crimes Act s 300(1), since repealed).  One offence of using a forged Commonwealth document ( Commonwealth Criminal Code s 145.1(5)).  In sentencing the applicant for this offence the sentencing judge took into account 17 offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth).  4The sentences imposed for these offences were:-  For each of the three offences of obtaining money by deception, a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 26 July 2009.  For the offence of participating in a criminal group, a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 26 September 2009.  For each of the two offences of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime, a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 26 November 2009.  For the offence of using a forged Commonwealth document and taking into account the offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act, a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 26 January 2010.  For one offence of using a false instrument and taking into account the further offences, a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of two years four months commencing on 26 March 2010 and a balance of the term of 1 year two months expiring 25 September 2013.  For each of one offence of using a false instrument and one offence of making a false instrument, a fixed term of imprisonment of 15 months commencing 26 March 2010.  5The effective total sentence consisted of a head sentence of four years two months and fixed terms and a non-parole period totalling three years.  The Facts of the Offences  6The agreed statement of the facts of the offences placed before the sentencing judge ran to 49 pages and his Honour's summary of the facts of the offences occupied several pages of his remarks on sentence.  Having regard to the nature of the only ground of appeal against sentence, it is sufficient to quote a few parts of his Honour's remarks, which indicate the general nature of the applicant's offending.  In these parts of his remarks his Honour said:-  ""The strike force was investigating the activities of an organised crime group that stole cheques and personal banking details in the mail.  Using those personal details on stolen bank documents, high quality counterfeit documents including driving licences and Medicare cards were manufactured and used to open bank accounts.  The stolen cheques were altered and negotiated through the fraudulently opened accounts.""  ""The offender, Daniel Horne, was one of a number of runners for the syndicate.  The role of the runner was that they had a key role of entering financial institutions with high quality counterfeit identity documents and pretending to be other people.  The offender, and other runners, then manipulated the accounts making deposits and withdrawals while purporting to be the legitimate account holder.""  ""He (the applicant) admitted relevantly that he opened numerous bank accounts and committed about $1,000,000 worth of frauds by his reckoning.  Assessments by the investigators indicate that the prisoner opened twenty-one bank accounts in false names at eight different banks and financial institutions.  Transactions totalling $1,024,822.88 were negotiated in these accounts.  There were some forty-six unlawfully obtained cheques totalling $713,299.88 laundered through those accounts and of this exposure $365,000 in over the counter withdrawals were made.""  ""The prisoner in the interview he provided to the police indicated what he was to be paid for what he did.  That was a flat fee of $100 to open each of the 21 bank accounts and also was to be paid 10% of the amounts withdrawn.  The prisoner gave evidence in the proceedings before this Court and said that he was in fact to gain 15 per cent of the withdrawals plus $100 for opening each of the accounts.  The facts do not otherwise nominate a sum which the prisoner ultimately obtained in the seven to nine months that he conducted these criminal activities.  However, using the formulae that he supplied, it seems to me that he may well have acquired an amount of something in the order of $155,000.""  The Applicant ' s Subjective Features  7The applicant was 34 years old at the time of being sentenced.  He had a minor previous criminal history, which the sentencing judge found to be comparatively insignificant.  8Up until about 2007, when he was aged in his early 30's, the applicant had not been a significant user of drugs, only using cannabis on an irregular basis.  However, in about 2007 he began experimenting with crystal methylamphetamine (""ice"").  Within two months of first using ice the applicant had become a heavy user and he was a heavy user during the period of his offending.  The prisoner gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence, which the sentencing judge accepted, that by the time he was arrested the applicant and his partner had a combined drug habit costing $10,000 a week.  9Until about five months before his arrest the applicant had had a significant gambling habit, sometimes gambling up to $1,000 at a time on poker machines.  However, about five months before his arrest he had succeeded in bringing his gambling addiction under control.  10After his arrest the applicant told police that he was prepared to assist in the arrest and prosecution of other persons in the criminal group, including giving evidence at any trials.  An affidavit from an investigating police officer disclosed the scope of the group's activities (approximately 200 victims and offences involving more than $5 million).  The applicant's assistance was assessed by police to be timely and accurate.  Cranshaw v R  11The sentencing judge found considerable assistance in sentencing the applicant in the earlier case of Cranshaw v R in which there was an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal [2009] NSWCCA 80.  12In Cranshaw the offender had been sentenced by another District Court judge for a large number of offences under s 178BA and s 300(2) of the Crimes Act .  In Cranshaw the offender had been a ""runner"" for a criminal group and Judge Lakatos found that the facts in Cranshaw were ""substantially similar, if not almost identical, to the prisoner's criminal offending here"".  Cranshaw also had not had any relevant prior criminal history and had had a significant drug problem.  He also had entered early pleas of guilty and had provided substantial assistance.  13In Cranshaw the sentencing judge had held that he should adopt a starting point for the aggregate sentence of seven years and should allow a combined discount of 45 per cent for the early pleas of guilty and the assistance, thus arriving at a total head sentence of three years 10 months.  14In the present case the sentencing judge considered that the applicant's offending had been somewhat more serious than Cranshaw's offending.  The applicant's offending had taken place over a longer period of time and had involved more money and the applicant, having moved to Queensland, had returned from Queensland and sought out a person higher in the group so that he could commence re-offending.  15Having regard to these differences in the two cases, the sentencing judge selected a starting point for the aggregate sentence of 7 1/2 years, and not 7 years.  The sentencing judge then allowed the same combined discount of 45 per cent for the early pleas of guilty and the assistance, arriving at a rounded-off figure of four years two months for the total head sentence.  His Honour then fixed a total non-parole period of 3 years.  The appeal against sentence  16The only ground of appeal against sentence was:-  The sentencing judge erred in failing to give effect to a finding of special circumstances.  17It was apparent from the submissions of counsel for the applicant that the ground of appeal was directed to the aggregate sentence and not to any particular individual sentence.  18The only part of the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence in which he referred to the subject of special circumstances was at the very end of his remarks, where, after stating the individual sentences he was imposing, his Honour said:-  ""That comprises an effective sentence therefore of a non-parole period of three years commencing from the date of your arrest being 26 July and expiring on 25 July 2012.  25 July 2012 is the earliest date in respect of which you will be eligible for release.  There is an additional balance of sentence of one year and two months which will expire on 25 September 2013.  Those sentences do not accord with the statutory ratio in s 44, however I find special circumstances by reason of the fact of your need for rehabilitation and to address your drug use and by reason of the accumulation of sentences.""  Submissions for the applicant  19Counsel for the applicant referred to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, as it then stood, which provided that the non-parole period of a sentence had to be not less than three quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the Court decided that there were special circumstances for it being less.  20The sentencing judge had found special circumstances within s 44(2).  However, the aggregate fixed terms and non-parole period imposed on the applicant were 72 per cent of the aggregate head sentences and the period during which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole had been increased by only about six weeks from what it would have been, if the ""statutory ratio"" under s 44(2) had been preserved.  It was submitted that the sentencing judge had failed to give effect in any significant way to his finding of special circumstances.  That finding had been based, not merely on the accumulation of sentences, but also on the applicant's need for rehabilitation, including his need to address his drug addiction.  21Counsel for the applicant referred to R v SJD [2004] NSWCCA 182. In SJD the principal judgment was given by Levine J, with whose judgment the others members of the Court agreed.  Levine J held that a reduction in the aggregate non-parole period of merely six weeks from what the aggregate non-parole period would have been if the statutory ratio had been observed, after the sentencing judge had made a finding of special circumstances, was erroneous.  Levine J referred in his judgment to parts of the evidence about the applicant which had been before the sentencing judge and to an express finding by the sentencing judge that the applicant would require ongoing rehabilitation in the community after his release.  Levine J concluded that the sentences actually pronounced did not accord with what the sentencing judge must clearly have had in mind.  22Counsel for the applicant referred to cases in which SJD has been followed, including Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 at [22].  23Counsel for the applicant also referred to Cranshaw , the case on which the sentencing judge had placed considerable reliance in arriving at the aggregate head sentence.  In Cranshaw the aggregate sentences imposed on the offender were head sentences totalling three years 10 months and non-parole periods totalling two years 10 months.  The sentencing judge had found special circumstances in the offender's drug addiction and in the accumulation of sentences.  24An appeal against sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal was successful, the Court of Criminal Appeal reducing the aggregate non-parole periods to two years six months and increasing the parole period to one year four months.  Hall J, who gave the principal judgment with which the other members of the Court agreed, held (at [71]) that ""this Court should proceed on the basis that his Honour intended to give effect to a finding of special circumstances but effectively failed to do so"".  25It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that there were good grounds in the present case for a substantially extended parole period, including that the applicant had had no significant criminal history before committing the offences for which he was sentenced and had a serious drug addiction.  Submissions for the Crown  26Counsel for the Crown submitted that s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , as it then stood, applied, on its proper interpretation, only to individual sentences and not to the aggregate sentence when a sentencing judge was sentencing for more than one offence.  Counsel referred to R v Swan [2005] NSWCCA 252 especially at [19] per Rothman J.  27It is convenient to deal with this submission immediately.  The submission may be strictly correct but sentencing judges and the Court of Criminal Appeal, in relation to sentencing for more than one offence, usually had some regard to the statutory ratio in s 44(2) in determining what should be the relationship between the aggregate non-parole periods and fixed terms and the aggregate head sentence and the present sentencing judge clearly had regard to this matter.  28Counsel for the Crown referred to cases in which it has been held that, if there has been a finding of special circumstances, the size of any adjustment to the statutory ratio so as to reflect the finding of special circumstances raises so many matters of a discretionary character that the Court of Criminal Appeal will be very slow to intervene.  These cases include:- R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; Stoeski v R [2008] NSWCCA 230 at [25].  29Counsel for the Crown also referred to the principle that the length of the non-parole period in a sentence (or the length of the total non-parole periods in a number of sentences), that is the time an offender must necessarily spend in prison before being eligible for release on parole, should properly reflect all the circumstances of the offence and the offender, including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence.  This principle operates to limit the range for an extended balance of the term of a sentence; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 718 [65].  30Counsel for the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had, near the beginning of his remarks on sentence, stated the overall sentence he intended to set and had, by the sentences he had proceeded to set, achieved precisely what he had intended.  The present case was not a case where the sentencing judge had failed to give effect to what he could be taken to have intended.  Decision  31At almost the beginning of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge said:-  ""Before I proceed to give my reasons I will indicate the effective sentence which I will impose at the end of these reasons.  In my opinion, the appropriate sentence for all of the matters is an effective sentence comprising a non-parole period of three years to date from the date of arrest and an additional term of one year and two months.  I will give the dates at the end of the reasons.""  Near the end of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge pronounced the individual sentences.  His Honour then summarised the effective sentence and made the finding of special circumstances, in the parts of his remarks which I quoted earlier in this judgment.  32It was appropriate, when his Honour was sentencing for such a large number of offences, for his Honour to have regard to the sentencing principle of totality and to give careful consideration to what aggregate sentence he should impose.  It was necessary that the aggregate sentence should fairly and justly reflect the total criminality of the offender's conduct; R v Weldon (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 at 62[46].  33The sentencing judge gave a careful explanation in his remarks on sentence of how he had arrived at the total head sentence of four years two months.  In my opinion, it can be inferred from his Honour's remarks that his Honour, having determined that the total head sentence should be four years two months, considered that a period of 3 years was the minimum period the applicant should necessarily have to serve in prison, having regard to the objective gravity of the offences he had committed and the need for the aggregate sentence to give effect to the various purposes of sentencing, including deterrence.  His Honour then noted that the aggregate head sentence of four years two months and the aggregate non-parole period of three years did not accord with the ratio in s 44(2) of the Act.  His Honour then made a finding of special circumstances.  34In my opinion, the present case is to be distinguished from other cases, in which the Court of Criminal Appeal has concluded that the sentencing judge failed in some way to achieve what the sentencing judge should be taken to have intended to achieve by a finding of special circumstances.  In the present case the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge achieved what his Honour stated, both near the beginning of his remarks and near the end of his remarks, as being what he intended to achieve.  In such a case this Court should respect the wide discretion which a sentencing judge who has made a finding of special circumstances has, in determining the extent of any departure from the statutory ratio.  35In my opinion, leave to appeal against sentence should be granted but the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.  36HOEBEN J: I agree with James J.  **********

2709042,Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227,"Judgment 

1THE COURT : The Applicant, David Ng, seeks an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal against sentences passed by Adams J on 20 August 2003 for the crimes of murder and aggravated armed robbery. 

2By Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal filed 10 January 2011, the Applicant sought leave to appeal with respect to conviction and sentence and notified grounds of appeal. 

3On 2 September 2011, the Applicant signed a Notice of Abandonment with respect to his appeal against conviction. Having forwarded the Notice of Abandonment to the Registrar, the application for an extension of time to seek leave to appeal against conviction is deemed to have been refused by the Court: Clause 27 Criminal Appeal Rules . 

The Application for Extension of Time to Appeal Against Sentence 

4There remains the application for an extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence under s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 

5In the context of an application for extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence, this Court said in Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [8], [13]: 

""8 The Court has a discretion with respect to extension of time under s.10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In exercising that discretion, the Court has regard to the prospects of success on the application for leave to appeal itself: R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [30]ff. The Court will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed, especially if the delay is considerable: R v Beattie [2000] NSWCCA 201 at [17]. 

... 

13 The principle of finality of litigation is relevant on an application such as this. Although it may be, as here, that the Crown cannot point to any actual prejudice because of the delay in bringing the application, there is a public interest in avoidance of delay, and the finality of litigation, in the area of sentencing as with litigation generally. In many cases, the prospect of sentence being reopened long after the event may impact adversely upon victims of crime."" 

6When considering the interests of justice in relation to an application for an extension of time, regard should be had to the interests of the Crown (representing the community) and the administration of justice generally, as well as the interests of the applicant for leave: Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [39]. 

7At the hearing on 6 September 2011, the Crown indicated that there was no objection to the application for an extension of time to appeal against sentence. 

8It remains a matter for the Court as to whether an extension should be granted. 

9The application for leave was filed more than seven years after the Applicant was sentenced in the Supreme Court. The Applicant relied upon his affidavit sworn 7 December 2010 and the affidavit of his solicitor, Nicholas Bryan Boyden, affirmed 23 December 2010 in support of the application for an extension of time. 

10The Applicant's affidavit revealed a sorry history of his attempts to appeal to this Court. The problems disclosed appear to lie with his past legal representatives, and not with the Applicant personally. 

11Mr Boyden's affidavit outlines the more recent history with respect to an assessment of whether arguable grounds existed for an appeal to this Court against conviction and sentence. 

12After the Court had been taken to material explaining the delay, and in light of the Crown concession that an extension was appropriate, together with the arguability of the grounds, the Court indicated on 6 September 2011 that an extension of time would be granted. 

Grounds of Appeal Concerning Sentence 

13The Applicant gave notice of the following grounds of appeal relating to sentence (Grounds 1-3 relate to the abandoned conviction appeal): 

(a) Ground 4 - his Honour erred in concluding that the Applicant was ""markedly more dangerous"" than Wai Kit Lo (""Lo""). 

(b) Ground 5 - the sentences imposed upon the Applicant leave him with a justifiable sense of grievance when compared to the sentence imposed upon Lo. 

14At the hearing before this Court, the Applicant was granted leave to add further grounds of appeal with respect to sentence in the following terms: 

(a) Ground 6 - the Applicant was denied procedural fairness in that the sentencing Judge failed to warn those acting for him that he proposed to impose a sentence longer than that indicated during the proceedings on sentence. 

(b) Ground 7 - his Honour erred in partially accumulating the sentence for the aggravated armed robbery offence upon the sentence imposed for the murder offence. 

The Sentences 

15The Applicant was convicted by a jury of murder and aggravated armed robbery following a trial between 26 May 2003 and 20 June 2003. On 20 August 2003, Adams J sentenced the Applicant. 

16On 26 March 2004, the sentencing of the Applicant was reopened to correct an error (which is not presently relevant). The operative sentences imposed upon the Applicant are as follows: 


 





Offence

Maximum Penalty

Sentence Imposed



Count 1 - Murder of Nigel Stiffe on 22 May 2001 contrary to s.19A Crimes Act 1900

Imprisonment for Life (no standard non-parole period applied as the offence was committed before February 2003)

Imprisonment for a total term of 35 years, comprising a non-parole period of 25 years and nine months commencing on 6 July 2003 and expiring on 5 April 2029, with a balance of term of nine years and three months commencing on 6 April 2029 and expiring on 5 July 2038


Count 2 - Aggravated armed robbery (being armed with a dangerous weapon) on 22 May 2001 contrary to s.97(2) Crimes Act 1900 

Imprisonment for 25 years

Fixed term of imprisonment for seven years commencing 6 July 2001 and expiring 5 July 2008
 

17The total effective term of imprisonment imposed upon the Applicant for the offences comprised a full term of imprisonment for 37 years with an effective non-parole period of 27 years and nine months. 

18Tried with the Applicant, and also convicted, was Teck Lee Lew (""Lew""). Lew appealed against sentence to this Court: R v Teck Lee Lew [2004] NSWCCA 320. Given the difference in charges between Lew and the Applicant, Lew's sentences and appeal are not relevant to the Applicant's sentence appeal. 

19The position is different, however, with respect to Lo, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Adams J on 9 May 2003: R v Lo [2003] NSWSC 582. Lo was called by the Crown to give evidence in the trial of the Applicant and Lew. 

Facts of Offences 

20On the morning of 22 May 2001, Nigel Stiffe, the manager of the Market City Tavern in Haymarket, was found dead in his office at the Tavern. He had been shot in the back of the head and his throat had been cut. At the time of his murder, he had been counting money from the Tavern's takings. 

21Two persons were responsible for the attack. Lo admitted to being one of those persons and he gave evidence for the Crown at trial. There was no issue that three weapons were used in the attack upon Mr Stiffe, being a gun, a knife and a metal pole. 

22The issue in the trial was the identity of the other attacker. By its verdicts, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the second attacker was the Applicant. 

23It should also be kept in mind that Lo and Sam Man Tran (""Tran""), on 14 May 2001, had committed an offence of attempted robbery of Mr Stiffe at the Tavern. The Applicant was not charged with the offence of 14 May 2001. This aspect is relevant to submissions made comparing the positions of Lo and the Applicant with respect to the parity ground. 
 
24Adams J made the following findings of fact for the purpose of sentencing the Applicant: R v Ng; R v Lew [2003] NSWSC 781 at [3]-[8]: 

""[3] Mr Stiffe was the manager of the Market City Tavern. Wai Kit Lo had been employed there for about six months but had resigned, perhaps involuntarily, some months before the offences. Teck Lee Lew was supervisor or shift manager at the Tavern and it was on his recommendation that Lo obtained work there. However, after Lo left that employment he and Lew remained in contact with each other. It was Lo's evidence that Lew suggested to him that the Tavern should be robbed and that he should find a gun for that purpose. Although the offender, Lew, admitted that he was a party to the plan to rob the Tavern he said that it was Lo's idea and that as he was then in desperate need of money he agreed to turn a blind eye to its commission. He denied that he ever discussed the possibility of the use of a gun or, for that matter, a knife in the robbery. He said that the only plan discussed was that Lo would use a metal bar, later described as a shopping trolley pole, to render Mr Stiffe unconscious by a blow to the head. On the whole I am minded to believe Lew's evidence on this point. Certainly Lo had something to gain, and he probably thought it would be a good deal, from alleging that Lew instigated the crime and proposed the use of a gun and not him. Furthermore, there is evidence, which I am minded to accept, that Lew at an earlier time warned Mr Stiffe that Lo had talked about a robbery and asked to ban him from the Tavern. In the absence of any supporting evidence I do not think that Lo's credibility is such that I could believe his evidence either as to Lew's instigating the offence, or as to the gun, or, for that matter, as to the knife. 

[4] On 14 May 2001, Lo and Tran were armed with a metal pole taken from a dismantled shopping trolley and a knife belonging to Lo's brother. In the result when it came to the point of actually attacking Mr Stiffe they desisted and left the premises before any alarm was raised. 

[5] So far as the offences that occurred on 21 May are concerned, Ng became involved some days before, although the precise date is uncertain. On the day of the crime Lo and Ng went from Lo's home to the Tavern, taking with them a change of clothes, including tracksuits and balaclavas, a metal pole, Lo's brother's knife and a pistol. The evidence does not permit me to conclude who of Lo or Ng obtained the gun though I think that Lo procured the knife and the pole. I have no doubt that Ng was well aware that the pole, knife and gun were being taken to the robbery. Nothing turns on who obtained or who carried what. The two men remained hidden overnight in the fire stairs where, later, fingerprints of Ng and cigarette butts containing his DNA were found. At about 6.40am on Tuesday 22 May, Mr Stiffe arrived for work at the Tavern and about an hour later he entered the cool room/office area where he normally counted the Tavern's overnight takings. A few minutes later Ng and Lo entered the office area wearing balaclavas and caps to conceal their identities from the closed circuit television cameras operating throughout the premises and also from Mr Stiffe. Again, who was armed with what is uncertain since I cannot accept Lo's evidence on this point beyond reasonable doubt. This is immaterial since I am satisfied that both of them had agreed that the respective weapons would be used as necessary although I accept that they expected that it would be sufficient to obtain Mr Stiffe's compliance if he were threatened with one or more of them. As the offenders entered the office Mr Stiffe got up and walked into the cool room and was struck from behind with a metal pole, it being again planned that he would be rendered unconscious. This, however, did not disable him and a struggle ensued during which the balaclavas worn by the offenders came off. Eventually Mr Stiffe was overpowered and forced to lie on the floor. He was then killed, the autopsy revealing that he suffered a fatal wound inflicted by the knife to his throat as well as a bullet wound to the back of this head. 

[6] Lo's account of what happened was calculated to reduce his own responsibility for the acts of killing Mr Stiffe but although there is good reason for believing that Ng indeed played the major role I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was so. However, whoever took the major role I have no doubt that both offenders were fully complicit and for all practical purposes equally culpable. 

[7] It is clear that Mr Stiffe was executed because he was able to identify the offenders, although he only knew Lo from previous acquaintance. Although the offenders had not planned on killing Mr Stiffe so that in that sense his death was not premeditated nevertheless it was a deliberate execution in cold blood. The offender, Lo, gave evidence on his plea as to the circumstances of the killing. I was prepared to accept that he was the follower, not the instigator, of the lethal assaults and the murder was not premeditated in the sense that it was planned from the beginning (taking and wearing the balaclavas being the strongest evidence of this) and thus that the case was not in the worst category of case. The evidence does not permit me to find as against Ng that he was the instigator of the killing. So far as he is concerned, therefore, I find that the crime does not fall into the worst category of case but not by much. 

[8] The offenders stole about $50,000 in cash from the office safe and fled taking money, knife, metal pole and pistol with them. In all the circumstances I think it likely that Ng became involved in the crime by agreement with Lo who was its instigator but he needed no persuading and thereafter enthusiastically participated in it so that the distinction in culpability is, I think, relatively slight. The aftermath of the offences is sufficiently set out in my reasons for sentence in respect of Lo and I do not intend to repeat them here."" 

The Applicant ' s Subjective Circumstances 

25There was a question in this Court as to the Applicant's correct age and date of birth. Given certain findings of the sentencing Judge, the Applicant's age is relevant to the appeal. It was common ground that the Applicant was born on 14 December 1975 so that he was aged 25 years and six months at the time of the offences and 27 years and eight months at the time of sentence. 

26Adams J summarised the Applicant's subjective circumstances at [13]-[14] of the remarks on sentence: 

[13] I come now to the subjective features of the case. David Ng is twenty-eight years of age and was born in Hong Kong, arriving in Australia with both parents when he was five years old. His father was a chef working in a restaurant in Chinatown and his mother confined herself to domestic duties. His upbringing was normal and unremarkable. 

[14] Ng was educated at a number of State schools, obtaining his Higher School Certificate in 1993. Since leaving school he attempted a business management course at TAFE but discontinued after six months. Since then he has worked selling clothes and toys door to door for a time then worked selling mobile telephones. He also worked part time as a waiter in various Chinese restaurants. He made a substantial profit from a fortunate real estate purchase. He has no physical or mental health problems. Ng claims that although he used cannabis and smoked heroin occasionally he is not and was not ever addicted to any substance. Psychometric testing indicated that he functions in the above average range with no significant personality issues. Ng has no relevant criminal record."" 

27The Applicant had a limited criminal history before the commission of these offences. In May 1994, he was fined $400.00 in the Downing Centre Local Court for common assault. In August 1995, he was fined $450.00 in the Burwood Local Court for possession of a prohibited drug. 

Some Further Findings of the Sentencing Judge 

28Adams J made some additional findings concerning the Applicant which are pertinent given the grounds of appeal on sentence. His Honour said at [15] and [17] of the remarks on sentence: 

""[15] If Ng so desired I have little doubt that he is capable of living in a law abiding and productive manner. Whether he wishes to do so it is impossible to say. It seems that he needed little, if any, encouragement to become involved in a very serious crime involving the use of potentially lethal weapons. The crime itself demonstrated a frightening degree of indifference to fundamental moral standards. He has not demonstrated any contrition or remorse. I am unable to see any signs that there are reasonable prospects for rehabilitation and therefore can make no allowance in his favour in this regard. His crime shows that he is a dangerous man and there is no reason to infer that he will be any less dangerous in the future. Of course, this does not mean that he should be sentenced for crimes that he has not committed but it does mean that the element of personal deterrence and protection of the community is more significant in his case than it was in the case of the offender, Lo. 

... 

[17] In many ways both Ng and Lew have been model prisoners, especially the offender, Lew, who has undertaken responsible work assisting Asian inmates to adjust to the correctional centre environment and avoid potential conflicts. An additional factor in Lew's case is that he pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery charge and indicated that he would do so at an early stage. He has also pleaded guilty to the charge of being an accessory before the fact of robbery and I should repeat here, as I have already pointed out, that this was robbery with an offensive, rather than a dangerous weapon, which is an important distinction in point of seriousness. Although in the circumstances his trial on the charge of murder was not thereby averted the plea simplified the trial significantly and involved admissions as to his complicity which the Crown could by no means have been confident of proving to the requisite degree of certainty. It seems to me that I should acknowledge the significance of those pleas in the sentence which I intend to impose. I regard it as significant from the point of view of the offender's chances of rehabilitation as well as reflecting on the seriousness of the crime that he did not participate in the crime in the result although his withdrawal was insufficient to comprise a defence to the charge. I accept that Lew's involvement in this crime was an aberration and that he is most unlikely to offend again. The extent of his actual involvement does not demonstrate nearly the level of criminal culpability shown by the offender, Ng, or, for that matter, the offender, Lo."" 

29His Honour referred to a number of factors in comparing the sentence imposed upon Lo with the circumstances of the Applicant. His Honour said at [19]-[20]: 

""[19] As is obvious from the sentence imposed on Wai Kit Lo the starting point before the deduction of forty per cent as provided by s22 and s23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1989 was thirty years' imprisonment. That figure reflected all the objective and subjective features of his case except the matters for which a discount was justified in the public interest. Thus I accepted that there were reasonable prospects of Lo's rehabilitation and accordingly I gave considerable weight to the importance of this consideration in respect especially of young offenders not only for their own sake but also in the public interest. 

[20] The offender, Ng, however, is significantly older than Lo and I do not think that his age gives rise to the same consideration that applied in Lo's case. As I have mentioned, there is not any evidence that Ng has accepted the need for rehabilitation. Leaving aside, therefore, the s22 and s23 considerations, the only potentially significant difference between them favouring Ng is that Lo was the instigator of the offence but he is considerably younger than Ng and has shown signs suggesting reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and whilst Ng did not instigate the offence he was a willing participant. He is older and without signs of rehabilitation. He is a markedly more dangerous man. I have also borne in mind that Lo's sentence for murder included an allowance for the robbery which was taken into account on a Form 1. This mode of dealing with Lo should be treated as part of the process of inducing him to plead guilty and give evidence against Ng and Lew. Ng must be separately sentenced for that offence and I do not regard the fact that it was taken into account in Lo's case requires that Ng should have the same effective result. I have concluded that I must impose on Ng a longer sentence than the sentence used as the starting point for the calculation of Low's [sic] discounted sentence. The armed robbery offence is so closely connected with the murder of Mr Stiffe that most of the sentence in respect of it, but not all, should be served concurrently with the sentence for murder. In this respect I have taken into account the requirement that the total term of imprisonment should not exceed the total criminality of the offences having regard to the sentence which I intend to impose with the consequent effect on the length of the non-parole period if there is no departure from the statutory calculation provided for in s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I do not consider that there are special circumstances which would justify a departure. So far as Lew is concerned his culpability is significantly less, as I have already said, than that of either Lo or Ng since not only did he play no part in the killing of Mr Stiffe and did not intend or foresee the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon him, though, as I have said, I think that he did foresee significant injury, at least amounting to a wounding, he did withdraw from active participation in the crime. His sentence should reflect some allowance for his pleas of guilty which operated not only in respect of those charges but also to reduce the issues which would otherwise have significantly complicated his trial as an accessory before the fact in respect of the murder of Mr Stiffe. As I have mentioned, I consider that his involvement in this offence was an aberration and am satisfied that it is most unlikely that he will offend again."" 

Ground 6 - The Claim of Denial of Procedural Fairness in the Sentencing Process 

30It will be convenient to commence with the sixth ground of appeal. Before doing so, however, mention should be made of the overlap between the grounds. 

31In one way or another, each of the Applicant's grounds relate to a comparison of the Applicant's case with the sentence imposed upon the co-offender, Lo, by Adams J on 9 May 2003. 

32In passing sentence upon Lo, Adams J used a starting point of imprisonment for 30 years. His Honour allowed an overall discount of 40% for that offender's voluntary admission of the crime to police upon arrest, his plea of guilty at the first practicable opportunity and his undertaking to give evidence against his accomplices. Taking into account the offence on a Form 1 (the offence of attempted armed robbery of Mr Stiffe committed on 14 May 2001), Adams J sentenced Lo to a full term of imprisonment for 18 years commencing on 3 July 2001 and expiring on 2 July 2019, with a non-parole period of 13 years and six months expiring on 2 January 2015. 

Events Giving Rise to the Claim of Denial of Procedural Fairness 

33The events upon which the Applicant relies, in support of the claim of a denial of procedural fairness during the sentencing process, commence with a discussion between the trial Judge and trial counsel for the Applicant soon after the jury had returned verdicts on 20 June 2003. During that discussion, his Honour said to counsel for the Applicant (T1-2, 20 June 2003) (emphasis added): 

"" You will recall that my starting point for Mr Lo was 30 years . You don't pass a sentence of that kind of severity by sleeping on it overnight, so what I would propose to do would be to hear submissions and then stand it over to a date to be fixed, depending on my own obligations in the Court, probably in a week or so I would expect. I would have no doubt a day would be enough. 

From your client's point of view, Mr McColm, there's not, you would probably wish to make submissions on the facts? 

MCCOLM [Applicant's trial counsel] : The facts. 

HIS HONOUR: But I can indicate now that I will certainly not make adverse findings against your client on the basis of anything that Lo said about what happened in that room that sought to reduce his responsibility my view would be, at the present time at least, that they were equally responsible . 

MCCOLM: That's what I would have put , so whatever occurred in the room, that on the material, that your Honour should not see it on the basis of anyone doing a particular act, and that's what my submissions would have been . 

HIS HONOUR: You are pushing an open door there. That's my view, unless the Crown persuades me otherwise . 

BARRETT [Crown Prosecutor] : I will not be making submissions ."" 

34The sentencing hearing proceeded on 21 July 2003. The Applicant's counsel tendered a report of Katherine Barrier, psychologist, dated 15 July 2003. The following exchange took place between the sentencing Judge and counsel for the Applicant (T28-30, 21 July 2003) (emphasis added): 

""HIS HONOUR: Is it fair to say there is nothing in Ms Barrier's report which suggests your client has any mitigating, or for that matter, psychological features? 

McCOLM: That is correct. In fact there is a term of being a normal and unremarkable-- 

HIS HONOUR: Murderer. There is no reason to think he is more dangerous than the acts which he has already committed would demonstrate or no reason to think that there is any psychological problem which mitigates his responsibility. 

McCOLM: That is correct. 

HIS HONOUR: Subject to what the Crown says my present view is that as between him and Lo I would frankly not believe what either of them said about who did what . 

McCOLM: Your Honour indicated as much on the last occasion . 

HIS HONOUR: In some respects there are some aspects of Lo's evidence which make him more persuasive but ultimately I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about matters adverse, in particular I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it was your client rather than he who either shot or used a knife and frankly I don't think it matters much . I think I said in my sentence reasons on Lo I didn't think it matters much and that is still my view . 

McCOLM: It follows whatever the evidence was given in the course of the prosecution case as to what occurred in that room whatever did occur. Your Honour on the last occasion said 30 years was the starting point as far as the sentence was concerned. Your Honour has repeated as much again in dealing with Mr Higgins' [counsel for Lew] submissions . Lo got a 40 per cent discount in respect of his plea of guilty and assistance to authorities plus other subjective-- 

HIS HONOUR: There is one possible difference between Lo and your client and that is Lo was certainly planning this robbery before your client got involved . 

McCOLM: It can't be said-- 

HIS HONOUR: The significance of that is something that has to be looked at carefully but it is a factor. 

McCOLM: He definitely was not the instigator or planner of the robbery. Whatever the planning was he was not involved in that initial planning. 

HIS HONOUR: He was involved in the planning enough on the crucial night. I am not sure it matters much but I think it is the same difference . 

McCOLM: The other difference is while there was evidence he was present on 14 May and evidence he was aware as to what transpired on 14 May, he was not involved-- 

HIS HONOUR: He has not been charged with it. 

McCOLM: Another difference is the difference in criminal records. David Ng has two offences on his criminal record, one for use of cannabis and one for the matter of assault. That matter for assault occurred in 1995 which is a bond. He used cannabis and received a fine. Ricky Lo had a number of matters on his record. 

HIS HONOUR: That is true, although out of his own mouth he used heroin. It was not significant in Lo's case and it is not significant in yours. 

McCOLM: Lo was on a recognisance at the time he committed these offences. 

HIS HONOUR: I had no record to that. He has never been caught. On his own confession he was guilty of offences relating to heroin. 

McCOLM: While he never had been caught, or contravened a court order of any kind. 

HIS HONOUR: That is true. 

McCOLM: They are the only differences I can point to between Ricky Lo and David Ng. As you see from the background in the report of Kathleen Barrier he is a young man 27 years of age. Up until recent times he had a steady work record. He was described as an unremarkable man. Came from Hong Kong and it is nothing to explain this behaviour in any way, his involvement in this matter by way of his background. Those are all the submissions. 

HIS HONOUR: I don't want you to think you should be in a position that you are precluded from persuading me that the 30 year starting point which I imposed on Lo was too high. Obviously I have come to a view about it and I must have regard to what the law says because parity is a question but at the same time if there are any material matters which suggest that that starting point is too high from your client's point of view you should not be precluded from making those submissions and I will look at that independently and fairly from your client's point of view . 

McCOLM: The main one is he was not the planner or instigator of this plan to rob the tavern. Secondly he must have been involved at a later stage. It was not his idea. 

HIS HONOUR: Is there any reason why I should not accept the evidence that he split the proceeds equally with Mr Lo, leaving Mr Lew's account out of consideration? 

McCOLM: There is no evidence I can point to to reject that. 

HIS HONOUR: Except Lo's general unreliability? 

McCOLM: No. Lo didn't account for what he did with his share so I can't go any further than that. It is just Lo's unreliability as to what occurred. While it is not the regime which is to be applied in this case the starting point under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is 20 years as a standard non-parole period. 

HIS HONOUR: For what offence? 

McCOLM: For murder. 

HIS HONOUR: There are murders and murders. This is a bad murder. 

McCOLM: There are two counts on the indictment. Any sentences should be imposed for those two matters in the circumstances applicable to David Ng and they should be concurrent. They arise clearly within the same series of facts and were part of the one enterprise, although one that ended in such tragic circumstances."" 

35The Crown Prosecutor made submissions on the question of sentence. In the course of those submissions, the following exchange took place between the sentencing Judge and the Crown Prosecutor (T32-33, 21 July 2003) (emphasis added): 

""BARRETT: Whether there was an earlier offence or not pales into insignificance. There is no distinction because they both clearly embarked on the offence, both deliberately took place in an execution style. Killing to avoid detection for their otherwise crime and they are responsible for it, whoever did what . 

HIS HONOUR: Is the point you are making this : accepting for a moment there is an instigation issue so far as the robbery is concerned which is overwhelmingly the more serious it is clear they were equally involved. One didn't instigate the other. They were both involved. I understand that . 

BARRETT: The sentence should be the same . It is artificial to distinguish between the culpability of Lo from Ng as to whoever was involved in an earlier robbery and whether Ng was or was not involved in the earlier robbery. 

HIS HONOUR: The effect might be I might impose, leaving aside the discounts for a moment, a higher sentence on Lo for instigating the robbery but you would not distinguish between them when it came to the murder . 

BARRETT: That is right. Ultimately there is no effective distinction between the conduct. I am talking about the ultimate sentence imposed on Mr Ng should not be distinguished, that would have been imposed on Lo but for the discount issues . These are the only submissions I make in relation to Mr Ng."" 

36At the conclusion of the Crown Prosecutor's submissions, the Applicant's counsel made the following brief submissions in reply (T38, 21 July 2003) (emphasis added): 

""McCOLM: In response to the Crown's assertion there was evidence Ng got the gun, the Crown referred to the evidence of Tran and the evidence of Tran was also at that time Lo was present while the gun was being used and played with, that he came into the room while the gun was being played with. 

HIS HONOUR: These are straws in the wind. In the end I don't think I could decide as between your client and Lo who found the gun . Each has a motive for lying about it Lo's is obvious, as is your client's motive."" 

37Adams J reserved his decision on sentence. On 20 August 2003, his Honour sentenced the Applicant and Lew. There is no dispute that his Honour did not call for further submissions between 21 July 2003 and 20 August 2003 on any issues pertinent to the sentencing of the Applicant. 

Submissions 

38Mr Boulten SC, for the Applicant, submits that practical injustice to the Applicant has resulted in this case as a result of the course of events between the delivery of verdicts by the jury and the sentencing of the Applicant. Put shortly, it is submitted that: 

(a) his Honour identified a starting point by way of an upper limit of imprisonment of 30 years on the murder count, subject to any submission from counsel for the Applicant (to seek to reduce this figure) or from the Crown on that issue - the Crown did not submit that a longer sentence was required and, in fact, accepted the appropriateness of that starting point - despite this, and without providing the Applicant with an opportunity to make further submissions, his Honour proceeded to sentence the Applicant to a full term of imprisonment for 35 years on the murder count; 

(b) in determining to sentence the Applicant for murder to imprisonment for 35 years, his Honour took into account (in a manner adverse to the Applicant) findings that the Applicant was ""a markedly more dangerous man"" than Lo (ROS [20]) and that the Applicant was ""significantly older than Lo"" and that his age did not ""give rise to the same consideration that applied in Lo's case"" (ROS [20]) when no such submissions had been made by the Crown, nor had such possible findings been identified by his Honour for comment by the Applicant's counsel. 

39Mr Boulten SC submitted that the failure of the sentencing Judge to provide an opportunity to the Applicant to make submissions on these issues, in particular after his Honour had identified an intention to proceed by way of a starting point of 30 years, constituted a denial of procedural fairness: Baroudi v R [2007] NSWCCA 48; Button v R [2010] NSWCCA 264. It was submitted that the proceedings miscarried as a result of these matters, and that the Applicant was denied procedural fairness by virtue of the failure to give any indication that the sentencing Judge might impose a significantly longer sentence than was indicated during the sentencing hearing. 

40The Crown submitted that the comments made by his Honour during the course of submissions should be construed as an acceptance that the objective criminality of the Applicant and Lo should be treated as the same, but not an indication that a starting point of 30 years' imprisonment was appropriate in the Applicant's case. It was submitted that counsel for the Applicant before Adams J had an opportunity to make submissions on sentence and that the Court should not conclude that a denial of procedural fairness had occurred. 

Decision 

41This Court has observed that it will not normally find an error of principle from interchanges between the Bench and counsel, since judicial views expressed during submissions do not necessarily reflect a considered decision: R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at [11]; R v Thompson [2005] NSWCCA 340; 156 A Crim R 467 at 474-475 [32]. It is the judgment of the Court which ought be considered for this purpose, and not exchanges between the Bench and counsel during the course of submissions. 

42Of course, the Applicant does not seek to rely here upon exchanges during submissions to demonstrate an erroneous view of law or fact on the part of the sentencing Judge. Rather, the Applicant submits that the course of events demonstrates a denial of procedural fairness to the Applicant. 

43The relevant principles to be applied when such a complaint is made were summarised helpfully by Garling J (Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing) in Weir v R [2011] NSWCCA 123 at [64]-[67]: 

""64 It is clear that an offender is entitled to procedural fairness during criminal proceedings, including proceedings on sentence: Pantorno v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 466 at 472-3 per Mason CJ and Brennan J, 482-483 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; Parker v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282; Baroudi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 48; Button v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 264. 

65 The particular form which procedural fairness dictates may vary. That is because the content of the requirement of fairness may be affected by what is said and done during the proceedings: Re Minister for Immigration & Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [34] per Gleeson CJ. Here the relevant process was the sentencing of Mr Weir by King DCJ in circumstances where, the applicant contends that, King DCJ indicated the sentence that he proposed to impose. 

66 The key to determining whether there has been a breach of the requirement of procedural fairness is to ascertain the consequence of any departure from the dictates of proper procedure because what is ultimately in issue is whether unfairness has resulted from the process: See Lam at [34]. The concern of the law is to avoid practical, and not merely theoretical, injustice: Lam at [37]. 

67 One common basis for demonstrating that practical injustice and unfairness has occurred is where an individual has lost the opportunity to make submissions to the decision maker in opposition to a proposed course and in support of a course which he urges: Lam at [36]; Button at [18]."" 

44It is, of course, necessary to read fairly the entirety of the sentencing transcript and the remarks on sentence, for the purpose of determining whether practical injustice has been demonstrated in this case. 

45It is apparent that his Honour articulated to counsel the 30-year starting point, utilised in sentencing Lo, as a prima facie starting point for the sentencing of the Applicant for murder. Soon after the jury had returned verdicts, his Honour stated this approach. His Honour's later comments reinforced this construction and understanding. 

46His Honour expressed this view as being subject to any submissions from the Crown. The submissions of the Crown Prosecutor did not contend for a different conclusion. In fact, the Crown submitted that ""the sentence should be the same"" (T33.7, 21 July 2003). 

47The Applicant's trial counsel approached the issue of sentence, as a matter of practical reality, upon the basis that an upper limit of 30 years constituted the starting point for the murder count, subject to any reduction flowing from acceptance of the Applicant's submissions. In circumstances where the Crown effectively endorsed the sentencing Judge's approach, it is understandable that the Applicant's counsel did not seek to address further on that issue. 

48We are satisfied that there has been a practical injustice, and substantial unfairness to the Applicant in this case in at least two respects. 

49Firstly, the Applicant received a longer sentence of imprisonment on the murder count than that which had been identified clearly by the sentencing Judge in the course of submissions, without any indication from his Honour that his view had altered in this respect, accompanied by an opportunity to make further submissions on the issue. 

50Secondly, the finding that the Applicant was ""a markedly more dangerous man"" than Lo (as an apparent basis for moving upwards from the 30-year starting point) had not emanated from any submission from the Crown nor from any exposure of his Honour's provisional thought processes during the sentencing hearing. To the extent that the question of dangerousness was referred to at all in submissions, his Honour had said ""There is no reason to think he is more dangerous than the acts which he has already committed would demonstrate or no reason to think that there is any psychological problem which mitigates his responsibility"" (T28.17, 21 July 2003) (see [34] above). 

51Nor was any submission made by reference to the principles in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465. The Applicant had a very limited criminal history (see [27] above). In sentencing the Applicant, his Honour observed that he ""has no relevant criminal record"" (ROS [14] at [26] above). 

52It is important to observe that this ground does not contend that his Honour was bound to impose a particular sentence because of the Crown concession on sentence or the common position expressed by counsel. It is for the Court to decide on sentence. The sentencing discretion is to be exercised in the public interest: Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 606E-F. There is no such thing as a plea agreement which restricts the sentencing Judge: GAS v The Queen [2004] HCA 22; 217 CLR 198 at 210-211 [27]-[32]; Ahmad v R [2006] NSWCCA 177 at [21]-[26]. 

53The present ground arises from the course of events which commenced with the expression of a 30-year starting point as a ceiling on the murder count, an expression which continued throughout the sentencing hearing. 

54We are satisfied that the course of events in the sentencing proceedings gave rise to a denial of procedural fairness to the Applicant. In our view, Ground 6 has been made good. 

55An acceptance of this ground does not mean that this Court will simply substitute what was indicated by the sentencing Judge as the sentence for murder in place of the sentence which was passed. The task of the Court is that described in Weir v R at [82], where error of this type was established: 

""The Court should re-exercise the sentencing discretion, taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles, with the view to formulating the opinion, for the purpose of s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 whether some lesser sentence is warranted in law: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at 287 [19]. The Court is obliged to look at the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the subjective features of the applicant and to consider what sentence achieves the purposes of sentencing set forth in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act."" 

56Before exercising this function, however, it is appropriate to consider the other grounds of appeal. 
 
Ground 4 - Challenge to the Conclusion that the Applicant Was ""Markedly More Dangerous"" Than Lo 

Submissions 

57In addition to the procedural fairness ground involving this finding, Mr Boulten SC submitted that the finding itself was erroneous as there was nothing in the Applicant's prior record, or any material before the Court, to warrant the finding. 

58The Crown submitted that the relevant enquiry in this Court was whether it was open to his Honour to make this finding. The Crown submitted that the nature of the crime of murder itself, described by his Honour as ""a deliberate execution in cold blood"" (ROS [7]), taken with the Applicant's lack of remorse and contrition, permitted a contrast between the Applicant and Lo so as to lead to the view that the finding was open to the sentencing Judge. 

Decision 

59This ground involves a contention by the Applicant that his Honour erred in making the relevant finding. This Court is bound by findings of fact by the sentencing Judge unless they were not open on the evidence, or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557 at 573 [60]-[61]. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the Judge has misdirected himself, but this Court has no power to substitute its own findings for those of the sentencing Judge: R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401. 

60We have already observed that no submission was made to the sentencing Judge by reference to the principles in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) . It should also be kept in mind that his Honour's finding was that the Applicant was ""a markedly more dangerous man"" than Lo. In one sense, the finding is one of greater dangerousness (by reference to a class of two persons only) as opposed to a general finding of dangerousness. 

61Whichever way the issue may be approached semantically, it is apparent that this finding was given significant weight by the sentencing Judge, so as to lengthen significantly the foreshadowed sentence on the murder count. 

62His Honour found that the Applicant's crime of murder ""shows that he is a dangerous man and there is no reason to infer that he will be any less dangerous in the future"" (ROS [15] quoted at [28] above). His Honour concluded that the ""element of personal deterrence and protection of the community"" were ""more significant in his case"" than in Lo's case (ROS [15]). 

63In Fardon v Attorney General for the State of Queensland [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575, Gleeson CJ observed at 589-590 [12]: 

""No doubt, predictions of future danger may be unreliable, but, as the case of Veen shows, they may also be right. Common law sentencing principles, and some legislative regimes, permit or require such predictions at the time of sentencing, which will often be many years before possible release."" 

64A sentencing Judge is entitled to take the circumstances of the offence into account in determining the question of future dangerousness. In R v Garforth (NSWCCA, 23 May 1994, unreported), the Court (Gleeson CJ, McInerney and Mathews JJ) said: 

""We return to the concepts of dangerousness and rehabilitation. It is now well settled that the protection of society - and hence the potential dangerousness of the offender - is a relevant matter on sentence. ( Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465). This factor cannot be given such weight as to lead to a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. But it can be used to offset a potentially mitigating feature of the case, such as the offender's mental condition, which might otherwise have led to a reduction of penalty. Mr Sides concedes that, in the case of homicides involving a high degree of culpability, the fact that the offender will be likely to remain a danger to the community for the rest of his of her life might justify the imposition of life imprisonment. But he argues that this concession can have no application here, as Newman J made no finding as to the applicant's continued dangerousness. As to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, his Honour found that they were poor. Mr Sides does not cavil with this finding, but submits that it is only where there are no prospects of rehabilitation that a life sentence should be imposed. 

... 

There are some cases in which the circumstances of an offence on their own suggest the possibility of dangerousness. This is one of them. The nature of the applicant's actions leads to a question whether he might act similarly in the future. In the present state of the evidence, no finding adverse to him can be made on this matter. However, by the same token, he cannot obtain a favourable finding on the issue."" 


65A number of observations should be made in the context of the present case. There was nothing in the Applicant's criminal history nor in the report of Ms Barrier, psychologist, which indicated that a finding of dangerousness was appropriate. There is no doubt that the circumstances of the murder in this case, aptly described as a cold-blooded execution, were capable of reflecting the way in which the Applicant might act, at some time in the future. 

66However, there were other features of the case which fell to be considered for the purpose of an assessment of dangerousness. As the sentencing Judge observed (at ROS [17]), the Applicant had been a ""model prisoner"" since being in custody. Further, any prediction of dangerousness would need to take into account the fact that the Applicant would not be eligible for release on parole until he was a middle-aged man. 

67The Applicant was born in December 1975. It would be many years before he was a candidate for release into the community, at which point the State Parole Authority would be in a position to make an assessment of his dangerousness, and the need to protect the safety of the community, in discharge of its statutory functions under s.135 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 . 

68In contrasting the Applicant and Lo, the sentencing Judge referred to Lo's remorse and contrition, which bore upon his prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour observed that a contrast could be made with the position of the Applicant. 

69The presence or absence of remorse is relevant to an offender's prospects of rehabilitation. However, remorse is not a precondition to a favourable finding concerning prospects of rehabilitation. In Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35, this Court said at [47]-[49]: 

""47 In R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at 169-170 [41], the Court of Criminal Appeal observed that remorse will be a major factor in determining whether an offender is unlikely to reoffend and had good prospects of rehabilitation and that, without true remorse, it is difficult to see how either finding could be made. Considerations of this type were clearly at the forefront of the sentencing Judge's thinking on this issue. 

48 This Court has observed that there can be rehabilitation without confession, and that offenders found guilty after trial are not to be automatically deprived of a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation unless they acknowledge their guilt: Alseedi v R [2009] NSWCCA 185 at [65]. In a different context, it has been said that a medical practitioner who has been deregistered because of proven sexual misconduct is not required to confess before he is reinstated, although continuing vigorous challenge to clearly established guilt may be indicative of continuing unfitness: Zaidi v Health Care Complaints Commission (1998) 44 NSWLR 82 at 100. Similar considerations arise where release on parole is being considered for a sex offender who denies guilt or refuses to undertake a custodial treatment programme: DCU v State Parole Authority of NSW [2006] NSWSC 526 at [46]-[55], [66]-[67]; Lee v State Parole Authority of NSW [2006] NSWSC 1225 at [59]-[64]. 

49 Evidence of different types may bear upon an assessment of an offender's prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of reoffending: R v Elyard [2006] NSWCCA 43 at [18]-[20], [86]-[92]. Evidence of an offender's genuine remorse and insight into the offending conduct may be powerful factors supporting a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation and unlikelihood of re-offending: R v MAK at 169-170 [41]."" 

70It should be kept in mind that the sentencing Judge was not able to make a finding as to which of the Applicant or Lo had committed the dreadful acts, including shooting the victim in the head and cutting his throat. The question of sentence was approached upon the basis that the Applicant and Lo should be treated as being equally culpable for these acts. 

71The finding of greater dangerousness on the part of the Applicant seems to flow solely from the absence of contrition and remorse and, to a lesser extent, the relatively small age gap between the two men, to which further reference will be made. 

72In the circumstances of this case, we are persuaded that it was not open to the sentencing Judge to make the finding that the Applicant was markedly more dangerous than Lo. 

73If his Honour had raised this issue with counsel during the sentencing hearing, it may well have been that the issue could have been laid to rest by submissions from the Crown and counsel for the Applicant. However, in the result, the finding was made and then deployed adversely to the Applicant. 

74The Court is satisfied that error has been established in accordance with Ground 4. 

Ground 5 - The Parity Ground 

Submissions 

75Mr Boulten SC submitted that, in the circumstances of the case, the Applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance when his sentence was compared with the (undiscounted) sentence relevant to Lo. The submissions advanced in support of this ground overlapped with submissions made for the Applicant in support of other grounds of appeal. 

76The Crown pointed to areas of difference between the Applicant and Lo and submitted that the Court ought be cautious before concluding that one offender has a justifiable sense of grievance, when both offenders had been sentenced by the same Judge who had given detailed reasons for imposing the sentences, taking into account the differing circumstances and indicating why the Judge was departing from the co-offender's sentence: Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [28]; Youkhana v R [2011] NSWCCA 37 at [45]. 

Some General Principles 

77There are significant advantages where related offenders are sentenced by the same Judge, with remarks on sentence containing factual findings and conclusions concerning the relative criminality of the offenders and differing subjective features of each of them: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71]; Gurney v R [2011] NSWCCA 48 at [81]-[82]; Dwayhi v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; 205 A Crim R 274 at 285-286 [39]-[43]. 

78Where the same Judge sentences two offenders at the same time and gives detailed reasons for imposing the sentences, having regard to the differing criminality of each, the differing subjective circumstances and relevant sentencing principles, this Court should be cautious before determining that one of the offenders has a justifiable sense of grievance because of different sentencing outcomes: R v Swan at [71]; Gurney v R at [82]; Dwayhi v R at 285 [39]-[41]. 

79Disparity between sentences is not of itself a basis of appellate intervention, but a factor to be weighed when the Court considers whether the sentencing process has been attended by error and, if so, whether the Court should intervene: R v Li [2005] NSWCCA 154 at [44]; Dwayhi at 282 [25]. 

80A complaint of disparity accepts that the sentence imposed on an offender cannot otherwise be challenged. It is the sentence imposed upon a co-offender which is said to give rise to a sense of injustice, not the sentence imposed upon the offender: Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189 at [7]; Dwayhi at 282 [26]. 

81The test for determining whether there is a legitimate sense of grievance is objective. What has to be demonstrated by an applicant is not that he or she feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the applicant's grievance is justified: R v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 at [34]; Dwayhi at 280-281 [21]. 

82Where there is a degree of disparity so as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for this Court to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective circumstances. This Court will not necessarily intervene where the co-offender's sentence is so inadequate that the Court should not take it into account: Lewins v R at [7]; Dwayhi at 280-281 [21]. 

83A ground asserting disparity is concerned with such markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on co-offenders that they give rise to a genuine feeling on the part of a reasonable and impartial observer that justice has not been achieved because one offender has been unfairly treated, having regard to the sentence passed upon the other offender. What is required is a gross, marked, glaring or manifest disparity: England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[67]; Dwayhi at 281-282 [23]-[24]. 

Decision 

84From what has been said so far in this judgment, consideration of other grounds of appeal has demonstrated significant difficulties with a number of findings made by the sentencing Judge, which his Honour relied upon to explain why he was imposing a different and longer sentence upon the Applicant for the murder count, than that which had been imposed (before the 40% discount) upon Lo. 

85Even though the Applicant and Lo were sentenced at different times, this Court should still be cautious in finding relevant disparity where related offenders are sentenced by the same Judge (see [78] above). Adopting a cautious approach, we are nevertheless satisfied that the Applicant's submission should be accepted that an objective and justifiable sense of grievance has been demonstrated in this case. The relevant distinguishing features, as between the Applicant and Lo, are affected by error. After consideration of relevant factors, a marked and unjustifiable difference in sentences is demonstrated. 

86Counsel for the Applicant has demonstrated further areas of difficulty with the remarks on sentence, from a parity perspective. 

87It is clear that Lo was sentenced for murder, with the attempted armed robbery committed one week earlier on 14 May 2001 to be taken into account on a Form 1. This was a serious and separate crime committed by Lo and another offender (Tran), in which the Applicant was not involved and had not been charged. Adams J observed, in sentencing the Applicant, that ""Lo's sentence for murder included an allowance for the robbery which was taken into account on a Form 1"" (ROS [20]). His Honour had said that the Form 1 matter had been taken into account when sentencing Lo (ROS [31]). Given the seriousness of the Form 1 matter, this Court should approach the matter on the basis that Lo's sentence for murder was increased to some extent, in accordance with the principles in Attorney General's Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at 158-159 [39]-[44]. 

88The Court is satisfied that, in sentencing the Applicant, his Honour mistakenly concluded that the aggravated armed robbery offence on 22 May 2001, charged separately against the Applicant, had been taken into account on a Form 1 with respect to Lo. This error is demonstrated by his Honour's statement in sentencing the Applicant, that the Applicant ""must be separately sentenced for that offence and I do not regard the fact that it was taken into account in Lo's case requires that [Ng] should have the same effective result"" (ROS [20] at [29] above). The fact is that it was a different offence committed on 14 May 2001, and not the aggravated armed robbery on 22 May 2001, that was taken into account on a Form 1 in sentencing Lo. 

89Further, we accept that his Honour erred in finding that Lo was ""considerably younger"" that the Applicant. Both were adult offenders at the time of the murder. Lo was born on 1 October 1978. The Applicant was born on 14 December 1975. Lo was aged 22 years and eight months and the Applicant was about 25 years and six months' old at the time of the murder. There was no evidence or finding that Lo was immature or that his involvement in the murder was related to youth. Indeed, as Mr Boulten SC submitted, it would be correct to characterise the crimes of both Lo and the Applicant as grave offences committed by adults. 

90We have kept in mind that the Crown's discretionary decision not to proceed against Lo at all for the 22 May 2001 aggravated armed robbery offence is a further point of distinction between the Applicant and Lo. This difference between the offenders does not assist the Applicant on the parity ground. It is not the business of the Courts to try and ameliorate the effects of prosecutorial decisions concerning charges against persons involved in a criminal enterprise: Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at 589 [203], 596 [247]; Dwayhi v R at 282-283 [28]-[29]. 

91That said, the various errors which have been demonstrated under separate grounds serve to undermine the Crown submission, on the parity ground, that the remarks on sentence with respect to the Applicant and Lo explain (without error) the different sentences imposed upon the two men. 

92We are satisfied that there is marked and unjustifiable disparity between the sentence of 35 years imposed on the Applicant, and the starting point of 30 years for Lo, on the murder count, so as to give rise to an objective and legitimate sense of grievance on the Applicant's part. 

93We uphold the sixth ground of appeal. We will return to the consequences of this finding after considering the final ground of appeal. 

Ground 7 - The Complaint of Error in Partial Accumulation of the Sentence for the Aggravated Armed Robbery Offence 

94During the course of the hearing on 6 September 2011, Mr Boulten SC sought, and was granted, leave to add a further ground of appeal asserting error in the partial accumulation of the sentence for the aggravated armed robbery offence committed on 22 May 2001. 

95This ground emerged from the very fair approach taken by the Crown Prosecutor on appeal, who had drawn the attention of the Court and the Applicant's counsel to the decision in Smale v R [2007] NSWCCA 328 at [130]-[133]. 

Submissions 

96Mr Boulten SC submitted that, in circumstances where the murder and aggravated armed robbery committed on 22 May 2001 were so closely associated, an entirely concurrent sentence ought to have been imposed for the latter offence, and that error had been demonstrated in the course taken in this respect by the sentencing Judge. 

97The Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that the overlapping criminality between the Applicant's murder and aggravated armed robbery offences attracted application of the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [40], [42] and Smale v R at [130]-[133]. The Crown conceded that a greater level of accumulation ought to have been granted by the sentencing Judge, but that some level of accumulation remained appropriate given the additional factual element in the armed robbery offence, being the robbery of a sum between $80,000.00 and $90,000.00 (T223.18, 3 June 2003). 

Decision 

98It is noteworthy that counsel for the Applicant at first instance submitted that the sentences for the murder and armed robbery offences ought be entirely concurrent (T30.30, 21 July 2003). It does not seem that the Crown Prosecutor, in the sentencing Court, advanced a contrary submission. 

99Nevertheless, it remained for the sentencing Judge to consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality in accordance with the principles in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27]. 

100In the circumstances of this case, it was necessary to have particular regard to the issue of overlapping criminality as between the offences. His Honour determined, in sentencing the Applicant, that the ""armed robbery offence is so closely connected with the murder of Mr Stiffe that most of the sentence in respect of it, but not all, should be served concurrently with the sentence for murder"" (ROS [20]). 

101This Court has had the benefit of further submissions from the Crown and Mr Boulten SC by reference to the principles in Pearce v The Queen , as applied in Smale v R . A conclusion ought be formed that a greater degree of concurrency was appropriate in this case. Nevertheless, some accumulation remained appropriate, given the additional element of the armed robbery offence whereby a substantial sum of money was stolen. 

102After applying relevant principles, we are satisfied that the measure of accumulation should not have exceeded a period of one year in this case, and that error has been demonstrated in the level of accumulation adopted in sentencing the Applicant. 

Resentencing the Applicant 

103The Applicant has demonstrated error in accordance with each of the grounds of appeal against sentence argued before this Court. The question for this Court is whether a lesser sentence for murder is warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . (See the extract from Weir v R at [55] above). 

104The Crown draws attention to his Honour's finding that the Applicant's crime of murder did ""not fall into the worst category of case but not by much"" (ROS [7]). This finding is not challenged on appeal. 

105The gravity of the murder in this case cannot be doubted. The Applicant and Lo went to the Tavern armed with a knife, a gun and a metal pole, intending to rob Mr Stiffe. Once their balaclavas had been dislodged in the course of the robbery, the Applicant and Lo decided to kill Mr Stiffe because of his ability to identify them. This was a deliberate murder to cover up another crime and to assist the murderers from being detected: R v Lett (NSWCCA, 27 March 1995, unreported); R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at [350]; R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4 at [87]. 

106The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. His Honour's finding meant that this penalty would not be imposed in this case, but that a very substantial term of imprisonment was required. 

107This murder was committed before the commencement of the standard non-parole period system, which applies to offences committed after 1 February 2003. It would have been entirely impermissible for the sentencing Judge to have regard to the existence of the standard non-parole period for a murder committed before the commencement of those provisions: McGrath v R [2010] NSWCCA 48; 199 A Crim R 527 at 536-537 [37]-[38], 540 [60]. 

108Although the Applicant's trial counsel, at one stage, raised the existence of the standard non-parole period in the course of submissions (see [34] above), the sentencing Judge did not have regard to it. 

109Nor can this Court in resentencing the Applicant. 

110In sentencing the Applicant, the Court has regard to the affidavit of the Applicant sworn 2 September 2011, which outlines his activities and employment in custody. It is fair to observe that the sentencing Judge's description of the Applicant as a model prisoner, at the time of sentence in August 2003, remains an apt description in September 2011. 

111In our view, having regard to the objective gravity of the Applicant's crime, his subjective circumstances and the sentence imposed upon Lo, it is appropriate to impose a head sentence of imprisonment for 30 years on the murder count. We do not consider that there are special circumstances which would justify a departure from the statutory ratio for the purpose of s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , so that a non-parole period of 22 years and six months ought be fixed. 

112The sentence for the aggravated armed robbery offence ought be confirmed, but with accumulation of one year only. 

113The total effective sentence will comprise imprisonment for 31 years with an effective non-parole period of 23 years and six months. 

114The Court should consider whether this measure of accumulation itself represents ""special circumstances"" given that the effect will be a non-parole period which marginally exceeds 75% of the total head sentence: Ollis v R [2011] NSWCCA 155 at [110]-[112]. 

115We do not consider that a finding of special circumstances should be made on this account. In our view, a non-parole period of 23 years and six months is the least period which the Applicant ought be required to serve for his crimes before being eligible for parole, having regard to all the purposes of punishment: Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [36]. 

116The Court acknowledges that the reopening of the question of the Applicant's sentence, many years after the tragic events of May 2001, will have reminded the family of Mr Stiffe of those terrible events and their devastating consequences. Adams J referred to the victim impact statement from Mr Stiffe's widow in his remarks on sentence ( R v Ng; R v Lew at [18]). The loss to the family and the community resulting from the death of Mr Stiffe is very great. The sentencing process cannot, in any way, compensate for that loss. However, the loss must be recognised and this Court should acknowledge that loss which, without doubt, continues to have consequences for the family. 

117The Court has granted the Applicant an extension of time to bring the application for leave to appeal against sentence during the course of the hearing on 6 September 2011. 

118We make the following orders: 

(a) grant leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 20 August 2003; 

(b) confirm the sentence imposed for the offence of aggravated armed robbery, being a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of seven years, commencing on 6 July 2001 and expiring on 5 July 2008; 

(c) quash the sentence imposed for the offence of murder and, in its place, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a total term of 30 years, comprising a non-parole period of 22 years and six months commencing on 6 July 2002 and expiring on 5 January 2025, with a balance of term of seven years and six months commencing on 6 January 2025 and expiring on 5 July 2032. 

(d) the earliest date upon which the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 6 January 2025.

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with Hoeben J. 

2JAMES J: I agree with Hoeben J. 

3HOEBEN J: As the three victims of the offences were under 18 years of age at the time of the offences, each of the victims will be referred to by their first name in this judgment to further the purpose of s15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. In addition, the applicant and other family members will be referred to by initials, as disclosure of their identity may serve to identify the victims. 

Offences and sentence 

4On 7 June 2010 on the first day of a trial, the applicant pleaded guilty before Syme DCJ to the following offences: 

Count 1: Aggravated act of indecency to a person under the age of 16 years (under authority) between 14 October 2004 and 1 January 2005, contrary to s61O(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. 

Count 3: Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child above the age 10 years and under 14 years (under authority) on 30 October 2004 contrary to s66C(2) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. 

Count 5: Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child above the age of 14 and under 16 years (under authority) between 26 July 2007 and 28 August 2007, contrary to s66C(4) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 12 years. 

Count 6: Aggravated act of indecency towards a person under the age of 16 years (under authority) between 9 April 2006 and 2 December 2006, contrary to s61O(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. 

5When the applicant came to be sentenced a form 1 document was placed before her Honour. That contained four counts of aggravated acts of indecency as follows: 

(1) Aggravated indecent assault person (Abbey) under 16 between 4 August 2009 and 14 September 2009 contrary to s61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. 

(2) Aggravated act of indecency towards person (Shannin) under the age of 16 (under authority) between 9 April 2006 and 2 December 2006, contrary to s61O(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. 

(3)&(4)Aggravated indecent assault on a person (Tara) (item 3 between 9 October 2005 and 21 November 2006) (item 4 on 30 October 2004) contrary to s61M(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty in each case is imprisonment for 7 years. 

The Form 1 offences were to be taken into account in respect of Count 3 on the indictment. 

6The sentencing proceedings took place before her Honour on 13 August 2010. Her Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: 

Count 1: Aggravated act of indecency - a fixed term of 2 years and 3 months commencing 27 October 2009. 

Count 6: Aggravated act of indecency - a fixed term of 2 years 8 months commencing 27 October 2010. 

Count 5: Sexual intercourse - imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 27 October 2012 and expiring 26 October 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years and 2 months expiring 26 December 2019. 

Count 3: Sexual intercourse - imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing 27 April 2015 and expiring 26 October 2019 with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months expiring 26 April 2024. 

The total sentence was therefore imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years, commencing 27 October 2009 and expiring 26 October 2019 with a balance of term of 41/2 years expiring 26 April 2024. 

7The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of these sentences. For ease of reference the first, second, third and fourth offences referred to in the grounds of appeal are respectively the offences charged in Counts 1, 3, 5 and 6 on the indictment. The applicant relies upon the following grounds: 

(1) The sentences imposed were unduly harsh and severe. 

(2) The sentencing judge erred in: 

(a) Imposing a sentence involving preventative detention. 
(b) Taking into account matters which were not part of the agreed facts. 
(c) Finding that the first offence was of mid-range criminality. 
(d) Finding that the second offence was an offence above the mid-range of seriousness. 
(e) Finding that the third offence was one of high criminality and above mid-range offending for this type of offence. 
(f) Finding that the fourth offence was above mid-range seriousness. 
(g) Taking into account a Form 1 matter on the fourth count. 
(h) Finding that the special feature aggravating the offence(s) was that each offence was committed in the home of victim. 
(i) Finding as an aggravating matter that the victims were asleep or pretending to be asleep. 
(j) Finding that the offences were aggravated by being planned or manipulated. 
(k) Finding that the offender's denials when first confronted were a matter of aggravation. 
(l) Finding the victims' ages were matters of aggravation. 
(m) Failing to take into account in assessing objective criminality the effect of alcohol. 
(n) Failing to take into account matters going to objective criminality. 
(o) Determining that the breach of parole was a serious aggravating circumstance. 
(p) Failing to take into account subjective matters. 

Factual background 

8The applicant was involved in a de facto relationship with SW from late 2003 until 12 September 2009. At the time the relationship commenced, SW had four children from a previous marriage: Tara born August 1991, Shannin born May 1993; B born July 1995 and Abbey born July 2002. The relationship between the applicant and SW produced two children. 

9From August 2004 until May 2005 the applicant, SW, Tara and Abbey resided together. Tara called the applicant ""dad"". On the night between 14 October 2004 and 1 January 2005, the applicant entered Tara's bedroom while she was lying in bed and said to her ""Are you awake?"". Tara did not respond. She was facing the applicant, lying on her side with her eyes partly open. The applicant was wearing a white singlet and a pair of dark coloured boxer shorts. The applicant pulled down his boxer shorts to expose his penis and commenced to masturbate in close proximity to her, by using his hand to rub his penis back and forth until he ejaculated. The applicant then left the room. At this time Tara was aged 13. This was the first time the applicant sexually abused Tara. This was the factual background to count 1 on the indictment. 

10The applicant continued to sexually abuse Tara during the time he was in a relationship with her mother. Tara estimated that the applicant subsequently committed acts of sexual abuse on or towards her on at least 30 separate occasions. Tara said: 

""[The applicant] played with himself in front of me on numerous occasions and that escalated to then rubbing and putting his finger into my vagina"". 

11On 30 October 2004 Tara was preparing to go to a birthday party and was in her bedroom. The applicant entered the bedroom and pulled down her pants. The applicant penetrated her vagina with his finger. At the time of this incident, Tara was 13 years of age. These are the facts relating to count 3 on the indictment and item number 4 on the Form 1. 

12The last time that the applicant abused Tara was between 26 July and 28 August 2007. One night between those dates, the applicant entered Tara's bedroom and woke her up. The applicant began masturbating in front of her. The applicant's penis was erect. He removed Tara's boxer shorts and placed his penis into her vagina. Tara was lying on her back on the bed and the applicant had his knees on the bed and he pulled her body into him. Tara described the sensation she felt as ""I felt [his] penis enter my vagina and then he pulled it out"". At the time of this incident, Tara was 15 years of age. This is the factual material relating to count 5 on the indictment. 

13From April 2006 until July 2007 Shannin was part of the household. One night during the period 9 April 2006 and 2 December 2006, the applicant entered the bedroom Shannin shared with her younger sister Abbey. Shannin was in bed, as was Abbey. The applicant tapped her on the shoulder and commenced to masturbate in front of her. Shannin was lying awake in bed whilst the applicant was standing in close proximity to her using his hand to rub his erect exposed penis. At the time of this incident, the child Shannin was 13. These are the facts in relation to count 6 on the indictment. 

14The conduct referred to in relation to this count and item 2 on the Form 1, was not isolated conduct. Such conduct happened ""many times"". The conduct in relation to Shannin ceased when the applicant attempted to take his own life on 1 December 2006. 

15The offence in item 1 on the Form 1 occurred in September 2009 when Abbey was playing in the lounge room after returning home from school. The applicant entered the room and placed himself behind her. He pulled her shorts down and placed his penis between the cheeks of her bottom and rubbed his penis back and forth. The applicant left the room and the child pulled up her pants and watched TV until her mother returned. Abbey was 7 years old at the time. 

16The offence in item 2 on the Form 1 occurred when Shannin returned home after shopping for new clothes with her mother. When she entered the lounge room where the applicant was, he commenced masturbating in front of her and asked her to model her new underwear which she refused to do. This offence occurred between April and December 2006. 

17The offence in item 3 on the Form 1 occurred when Tara was home from school sick. While Tara was sitting in the lounge room, the applicant walked up to her, unzipped his pants and exposed his penis. The applicant said ""just touch it"". When Tara replied ""I don't want to"", the applicant grabbed the child's hand and forced it onto his penis. Tara was 14 or 15 when this occurred. 

18The offence in item 4 on the Form 1 occurred on the occasion when Tara was preparing to go to a birthday party (see [9] hereof). The applicant entered the bedroom and pushed her onto the bed. He then pulled his pants down, placed his penis onto her vagina, rubbing it along her vagina. After a short time the applicant pulled up his pants and left the room. 

19Tara had disclosed the abuse to her mother, her boyfriend and her boyfriend's mother. She did this late in 2006 or early 2007. SW confronted the offender and he denied touching Tara. The police were not contacted on that occasion. Shannin made a disclosure to friends in 2007 but it was never reported to the police. 

20On 13 September 2009 Abbey, who was then 7 years old, disclosed sexual assault upon her by the applicant. Her siblings then also disclosed historical sexual abuse and the police became involved. 

21On 27 October 2009 the applicant was arrested in relation to these matters. He has been in custody in relation to these matters since that time. 

Remarks on sentence 

22Her Honour noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty on the first day of trial and accordingly allowed him a discount of 10 percent for the utilitarian value of the plea. Her Honour noted that many of the offences had features of aggravation and mitigation which were common to all of them. Her Honour proposed to deal with those common features first. Her Honour noted that the four offences charged, especially those against Tara, were part of a series of similar events, or a course of conduct, that occurred at least 30 times. Accordingly, her Honour found that these charged events were not isolated incidents and deprived the applicant of any leniency which might otherwise arise in his favour. 

23Her Honour referred to the breach of trust which was a feature of all of the charged offences in that the children were under the applicant's authority as their stepfather at the time. Her Honour said: 

""The Court does not then take this into account as a separate aggravating feature, however, the degree of breach of trust is a consideration when assessing criminality. 

It is an obvious aggravating feature that if the offender was in a position of trust and violated that trust by sexually assaulting the children, the abuse of trust is considered more serious where the offender is the father or family member of the victim. Sentences must be of a severe nature and little leniency can be given."" (ROS 4.2) 

24Her Honour was not prepared to treat lack of threats and lack of coercion as a mitigating factor. She said: 

""In the present case there was no need for BIP to threaten or physically coerce the children because of the power he had over them. The girls felt powerless to stop him and their vulnerability was based on their wish to maintain a relationship with him and their mother. The fact that they called him ""dad"", even though he was repeatedly sexually abusing them, speaks of their vulnerability more than it speaks of his fitness as a father. This is not a mitigating factor."" (ROS 4.8) 

25Her Honour treated the fact that the offences were committed in the home as an aggravating feature. Her Honour said: 

""Each of these offences was committed in the home of the victims. They also occurred when they were under his authority, but this is a different feature. The fact that the offences were committed in the home, which is supposed to be a place of sanctuary and safety and sometimes, at least when it commenced, in the girls' bedrooms, was a serious invasion of their privacy in a different way. The place where the offences were committed meant effectively that the victims had no place of safety to escape to."" (ROS 5.1) 

26In relation to the age of the victims, her Honour said: 

""I take into account that for the substantive offences the age range variously for the separate offences is either between 10 and 14 years or up to 16 years. In relation to each of these offences both girls were well below the stated age range for each particular offence, but it is a matter that I will take into account considering of course that each of these offences have their inbuilt age factor referred to as a particular of the offence."" (ROS 5.6) 

27Her Honour took into account as an aggravating feature that the children were asleep when some of the offences occurred. Her Honour stated that a child in her bedroom in her home and asleep was in a more vulnerable position which the applicant took advantage of. 

28In relation to planning, her Honour said: 

""It is true that there is no planning involved in a criminal organisation in that sense. However, the offender and SW commenced a de facto relationship when the children were very young. The applicant started offending a relatively short time thereafter. His offending continued and he took advantage of SW's absences from home and given the degree of privacy to force his attentions on the children. He did this frequently. The degree of planning is to do with him manipulating the family situation to suit his own sexual gratification needs. In such a case the planning was more long term and is an aggravating circumstance as by manipulating the family dynamics by placing himself in a trusted position by being available to supervise the children and by making excuses to go into their rooms in night in order to abuse them. It is that issue of planning that concerns me and it is that issue of planning that I take into account as part of the objective seriousness of the offence. I do not accept that all of these activities happened fortuitously and therefore involved no planning."" (ROS 6.8) 

29Her Honour went on to say: 

""BIP told the psychologist who reported that he could not recall the offences in detail but when he was sober after having committed the offences the night before he felt full of guilt. The fact that these offences continued over several years with two children and commenced on the third child later on, does not support his self-minimising statements now. I do not accept them. 

When the offender was confronted in 2006 by the child Tara in front of SW he denied the offences. Thereafter he continued to offend even against the same child in a more serious fashion, knowing that she was not consenting and in fact had complained about his actions but apparently confident in the knowledge that her complaints would continue to be disregarded. His denials disempowered the child Tara even further and therefore will be taken into account by me, not as planning in the usual sense but certainly premeditation."" (ROS 7.2) 

30Her Honour noted that the applicant was on parole at the time of the offences. She said: 

""Further in considering aggravating and mitigating circumstances I have already referred to the aggravating circumstances that I have taken into account. I note further that in relation to sequence 1 and 3 on the indictment, the offender was on parole when the offences were committed, not for like matters but he was placed on parole in October 2004 for a period of 6 months for an assault matter. Therefore, in relation to those offences for which this is relevant, this is a serious aggravating circumstance."" (ROS 8.5) 

31Her Honour found that there was no clear evidence as to the impact on the victims of the applicant's conduct. Nevertheless, her Honour took into account what she regarded as the ""general consequences for children of offending of this nature"". She was not prepared to find that there was ""substantial loss"" experienced by the victims. 

32Her Honour treated the question of whether the offender was likely to re-offend or not, his prospects of rehabilitation and his remorse together. She noted that a psychologist, Mr Howard, had reported the applicant as being ashamed and remorseful. Her Honour concluded that if the applicant participated in sex offender programs while he was in custody, there would be ""reasonable rather than good prospects of rehabilitation"". Her Honour was prepared to take the applicant's plea of guilty as some indication of genuine remorse. 

33Her Honour then proceeded to assess the level of criminality of each offence. In respect of count 1, her Honour noted that Tara was 13 years of age, this was the first time the applicant had sexually abused her, the applicant was on parole, there was no physical contact, the child was in bed possibly asleep, ejaculation occurred and the maximum cut off age for the offence was 16. Taking those matters into account, her Honour assessed it as an offence of mid-range criminality. 

34In relation to count 3, her Honour took into account that Tara was aged 13, the applicant entered the bedroom, pulled down her pants, and that he digitally penetrated her vagina. Her Honour also took into account that the length of time during which the offence occurred was not very long. Her Honour assessed this offence as being above the mid-range of seriousness. 

35In relation to count 5, her Honour took into account that the applicant had entered Tara's bedroom, woke her, began masturbating in front of her until his penis was erect and having removed her shorts, placed his penis into her vagina. Her Honour took into account that at the time Tara was 15 years of age, and that the length of time during which the offence occurred was unknown, but of relatively short duration. Her Honour found that this was not an isolated incident. Her Honour said: ""The age of the child, the cut off age of 16 years and the fact that she was asleep when he entered her bedroom meant that the offence was of high criminality"". Her Honour assessed it as above mid-range offending for this kind of offence. 

36In relation to count 6, her Honour took into account that Shannin was part of the household, she was 13, that the applicant had entered her bedroom which she shared with Abbey, that she was in bed lying awake while the applicant was standing in close proximity to her and that the applicant rubbed his exposed penis in front of her. Her Honour also noted that this was not isolated conduct and only ceased when the applicant attempted to take his own life in December 2006. While there was no direct contact, her Honour assessed the offence as being above the mid-range of seriousness. 

37In relation to the applicant's subjective case, he was aged 36 at the time of sentence. He was the fourth of five children. His parents had a somewhat dysfunctional life but he had their support. His mother regularly abused alcohol and other substances and was on occasions physically violent towards his father who was frequently absent. Nevertheless, at the time of sentencing the applicant had the support of members of his family. The applicant and his sister gave evidence. 

38The applicant completed his secondary education to year 9 and then left school and commenced work. He had worked as a labourer and painter throughout his working life. There were from time to time financial stressors in his life which caused difficulties. 

39The applicant had issues with drug and alcohol abuse throughout his life. He attempted suicide in December 2006. This was apparently related to substance abuse, although the details were not clear. Her Honour noted that the applicant was stable at the time of sentencing because while he was in custody, he was not abusing drugs. Her Honour was impressed by the evidence of the applicant's sister who presented as a supportive and insightful person who would be able to provide the applicant with substantial assistance upon his release from custody. 

40In relation to the sentence which she proposed to pass, her Honour said: 

""In relation to BIP it is of course important to ensure that this offender is adequately punished for these most serious offences. It is important to consider the prospect of general deterrence although it is unknown what effect the sentencing of this offender will have generally on the community, but certainly it is an important consideration, as is the issue of specific deterrence. It is in this type of offence very important to protect the community and more importantly of course each of these victims from the offender by making a lengthy custodial term that will have that effect, but it is also important to consider and to promote rehabilitation of the offender."" (ROS 16.9) 

41Her Honour backdated the commencement date of the sentence to 27 October 2009 when the applicant went into custody. Her Honour declined to find special circumstances. 

APPEAL 
Ground 1 - The sentences passed were unduly harsh and severe 
42The applicant did not make any specific submissions in relation to the first ground of the appeal, other than by reference to the individual criticisms set out in ground 2. He did submit, however, that by reference to sentencing statistics, the sentences imposed were very much on the high side and that the extent of the accumulation was excessive so that the principle of totality was offended. 

43The thrust of the submission was really directed to the effect of the individual items of complaint set out in the second ground of appeal. The applicant submitted that whilst some of the matters raised would not of themselves justify the intervention of this Court, the number of errors made by the sentencing judge was such that this Court should intervene to reduce the sentence, either by adjusting the individual sentences or by altering the extent of the accumulation provided for by her Honour. 

Ground 2(a) - Imposing a sentence involving preventative detention 

44The applicant submitted that her Honour's observation at ROS 16.9 that ""it is in this type of offence very important to protect the community and more importantly of course each of these victims from the offender by making a lengthy custodial term that will have that effect ..."" involved a finding which was contrary to principle. The applicant referred to Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 473 where the Court said: 

""It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of a sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence. The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventative detention which is impermissible and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society, among other factors, which is permissible."" 

45The applicant submitted that as well as being contrary to principle, the statement was not supported by the evidence. He submitted that there was no evidence that he presented any continuing threat to the victims. 

46On one view of what her Honour said she was doing no more than restating one of the purposes of sentencing an offender set out in s3A(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Had her Honour restricted her statement to the protection of the community, no real criticism could be made of it. There is, however, some force in the applicant's complaint about her Honour saying that ""in this case it was very important to protect each of these victims from the offender by making a lengthy custodial term that will have that effect"". There was no evidence before her Honour to support the proposition that the applicant presented any continuing threat to any of the victims. There was no submission by the Crown to that effect. Her Honour erred in making that statement. 

2(b) - Taking into account matters that were not part of the agreed facts 

47The applicant submitted that her Honour made a number of findings of fact which were not part of the agreed facts and which were not based on any evidence before her. The specific matters in relation to which the applicant complained were: 

(i) That all four offences charged were part of a series of similar events or a course of conduct that had continued at least thirty times (ROS 3.5) and in respect of Count 5 ""it was not an isolated incident"" (ROS 13.3). 

(ii) ""The girls felt powerless to stop him and their vulnerability was based on their wish to maintain a relationship with him and their mother"" (ROS 4.8). 

(iii) ""The degree of planning is to do with him manipulating the family situation to suit his own sexual gratification needs. In such a case the planning was more long term and is an aggravating circumstance as by manipulating the family dynamics by placing himself in a trusted position by being available to supervise the children and by making excuses to go into their rooms at night in order to abuse them"". (ROS 6.9) 

(iv) ""In relation to each of these offences both girls were well below the stated age range for each particular offence"" (ROS 5.7). 

48The applicant's submission on this issue is well founded. What is clear from the agreed facts and the description of the offences, both the counts for which the applicant was sentenced and those on the Form 1, is that there was only one occasion of vaginal penetration, although there was the rubbing of the vagina in one of the Form 1 offences. There was only one incident of digital penetration. The offences which appear to have been repeated on a regular basis, and to which both Tara and Shannin were referring, were the masturbatory offences where no touching was actually involved. Because of the significant difference in penalty for each offence, it was important for her Honour to keep clearly in mind exactly what offences could be properly regarded as ""representative offences"" and what could not. 

49In relation to (ii), there was nothing to this effect in the agreed facts before her Honour. While it was open to her Honour to make some general observations as to the helplessness of young persons placed in a similar position to these victims, that is not what her Honour did. Her Honour appears to have made findings of fact which were not open to her on the evidence. 

50In relation to (iii), this involved impermissible speculation on the part of her Honour on an issue which her Honour clearly regarded as important, i.e. planning. There was no evidence before her Honour to justify such a finding. On the contrary, the effect of the evidence was that these offences were opportunistic and were largely driven by the applicant's substance abuse. 

51In relation to (iv), this was also an important finding which was not supported by the evidence. It was simply incorrect to say that in relation to each of the four offences charged, that both girls were ""well below the stated age range for each particular offence"". 







2(c) Finding that the first offence was of mid-range criminality 
2(d) Finding that the second offence was an offence above the mid-range of seriousness 
2(e) Finding that the third offence was one of high criminality and above mid-range offending for this kind of offence 
2(f) Finding that the fourth offence was above mid-range seriousness 
2(n) Failing to take into account matters going to objective criminality 

52It is convenient to deal with these five submissions together since they raise the same issues. The applicant submitted that no reasons were provided by her Honour as to how she arrived at her assessment of relative seriousness for these offences. The applicant particularly complained of her Honour's approach to the fourth offence. In relation to that offence, the Crown submitted that it was below mid-range of seriousness and her Honour did not give any indication to the contrary when that submission was made. When giving her reasons, however, her Honour made a different assessment without giving the applicant any chance to raise contrary arguments. 

53The applicant submitted that in each case her Honour had over estimated the level of criminality involved. Finally, the applicant submitted that this kind of assessment by her Honour was inappropriate in the circumstances since none of the offences had a standard non-parole period. The applicant submitted that her Honour should have approached the question of objective seriousness in a different way. 

54While it is difficult to see the purpose of her Honour approaching the objective seriousness of the offences in the way in which she did, given that a standard non-parole period did not apply to any of the offences, the task being performed by her Honour was essentially discretionary. In Mirza v R [2007] NSWCCA 248, Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed) said: 

""16 It has been held by this Court that a sentencing judge's assessment of where in a range of criminal conduct encompassed by an offence a particular instance of offending stands is a matter of fact upon which minds might reasonably differ. Generally this Court would not interfere in that assessment unless it was clearly erroneous: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282. Here the assessment was supported by adequate reasons: cf Dang v R [2005] NSWCCA 430. 

55Nevertheless, there is some force in the applicant's submission in that her Honour's reasoning is not particularly clear in reaching her conclusions and some of that reasoning, as previously indicated, is based on an incorrect statement of the facts. 

56A particular difficulty I have which was not raised by the applicant, but which emerged in the course of submissions, is that factually I can see no difference between count 1 and count 6. The age of the victim was the same, there was no actual touching and the actions constituting the offence were the same, i.e. masturbation in front of the victim. In the case of count 1, her Honour assessed the level of criminality at mid-range, but in the case of count 6, at above mid-range. While I do not accept all of the submissions of the applicant on this issue, there does seem to be some inconsistency in her Honour's approach to what appear to be identical offences. 

2(g) Taking into account a Form 1 matter in relation to the fourth count 

57This is in fact a reference to count 6 on the indictment. The applicant submitted that her Honour impermissibly took into account the second of the Form 1 offences when assessing the objective seriousness of this offence. 

58This submission has not been made out. It is clear from the context in which her Honour was referring to the second offence on the Form 1 that her Honour was merely emphasising the fact that count 6 was representative in nature in that it was an offence of a kind which had been committed by the applicant in relation to this victim on more than one occasion. 

2(h) Finding that a special feature aggravating the offence was that each offence was committed in the home of the victims 

59The applicant submitted that this was not a matter raised by the Crown in argument and consequently, there was a denial of procedural fairness in her Honour relying upon it. 

60The Crown correctly conceded that this complaint was made out if her Honour had taken this into account as a separate aggravating factor. This was clearly the case. Her Honour did not refer to this consideration as part of the overall breach of trust she was considering, but gave it particular weight in that ""the place where the offences were committed meant effectively that the victims had no place of safety to escape to"" (ROS 5.2). 

61This was an erroneous approach on the part of her Honour. In R v Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125 Hidden and Hislop JJ said that in the circumstances of that case where a husband had assaulted his wife, it was not further aggravated by the fact that the assault was perpetrated in the matrimonial home. See also EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 199 at [79] per RA Hulme J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing), Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88. In any event, it is difficult to see how this consideration constituted an extra matter of aggravation in the light of her Honour's emphasis upon the applicant's relationship to the children as the basis for the breach of trust. 

2(i) Finding as an aggravating matter that the victims were asleep or pretending to be asleep 

62The applicant submitted that apart from being denied procedural fairness in that this matter was not raised before her Honour in the sentencing proceedings, there was no reasoning set out by her Honour to underpin the finding. 

63I agree. It is difficult to see as a matter of logic how this could constitute a matter of aggravation in the circumstances of this case. Her Honour should not have taken this into account as an aggravating factor. 

2(j) Finding that the offences were aggravated by being planned or manipulated 

64The applicant made the same submissions in relation to 2(b)(iii). I have already indicated that this finding was not open to her Honour. Not only was it not supported by the evidence, it was contrary to the evidence which was actually before her Honour, i.e. that all of the offences appear to have occurred when the applicant was intoxicated by reason of either drink or drugs. This was expressly accepted by the Crown in the sentencing hearing (T.19 on 13.8.2010). 

2(k) Finding that the offender's denials when first confronted were a matter of aggravation 

65The applicant submitted that it was not open to her Honour to take account of this as an aggravating factor because it involved premeditation and as disempowering the child (ROS 7.5). The applicant submitted that this was not a matter raised at the sentence proceedings and it ignored the sworn evidence of the applicant that he was frightened of telling the truth. 

66While the precise way in which her Honour sought to use this material was not open to her, the fact that the applicant did deny Tara's allegations when made and then continued to commit offences against her thereafter was clearly a matter of aggravation which her Honour could properly take into account. This ground of appeal while made out, does not advance the applicant's case. 




2(l) The sentencing judge erred in finding that the victims' ages were matters of aggravation 

67The applicant submitted that the ages of the victims formed part of the ingredients of the offence. Accordingly, it was not open to her Honour to take their ages into account as matters of aggravation unless, as her Honour erroneously asserted, the victims were well below the stated age for each offence. 

68I agree with this applicant's submission. As already indicated in respect of Ground 2(b)(iv), such was not the case. It was not open to Her Honour to take this into account as a matter of aggravation. Not only was it factually incorrect to say that the victims were well below the stated age for each offence, but such an approach involved a real risk of double counting to the detriment of the applicant. 

2(m) Failing to take into account in assessing objective criminality the effect of alcohol 
2(p) Failing to take into account subjective matters 

69The applicant submitted that her Honour was in error in saying that intoxication was not relevant to the evaluation of objective seriousness. The applicant submitted that intoxication was relevant to mitigate objective criminality in that it had the potential to indicate that the conduct was impulsive and unplanned ( Waters v R [2007] NSWCCA 219; R v Mitchell [2007] NSWCCA 296; R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 at [273 - 274].) 

70This submission has already been made by the applicant, i.e. the evidence before her Honour was very much to the effect that these offences were opportunistic rather than planned or premeditated because of his ingestion of drugs and alcohol. Apart from that consideration, however, her Honour was entitled to disregard those matters as mitigating factors. 

2(o) Determining that the breach of parole was a serious aggravating circumstance 

71The applicant accepted that any breach of parole was an aggravating matter at law. However, in this case the offence in respect of which parole had been granted to the applicant (a minor assault matter) was of an entirely different character to the offences for which the applicant was being sentenced. He submitted that at most, her Honour should have treated the fact of parole as a minor matter of aggravation. 

72I agree. In the circumstances of this case it was not appropriate for her Honour to characterise the breach of parole as a ""serious aggravating circumstance"" given the nature of the offences under consideration. 

Conclusion 

73As her Honour appreciated, all of these offences were serious. The very ingredients of the offences and the circumstances of their commission involved breaches of trust and serious criminality against young vulnerable persons. In relation to the masturbatory offences, they had occurred on frequent occasions and all of the offending had taken place over a substantial period of time. The moral culpability of the applicant was high. Nothing other than a substantial sentence of imprisonment was appropriate. 

74That having been said, the applicant's submissions have identified a number of errors of varying degrees of seriousness in her Honour's performance of the sentencing function. Whereas some errors of this kind could be explained as involving imprecision of expression or as not significantly influencing the sentencing judge, such is not the situation here. 

75In this case the very number of instances identified by the applicant where adverse findings were incorrectly made against him must lead the Court to conclude that cumulatively they had a significant affect upon her Honour's exercise of her sentencing discretion. This is the conclusion that I have arrived at. 

76I have concluded that the applicant should be re-sentenced and that there should be some adjustment to the sentences passed by her Honour to more accurately reflect the facts relating to these offences. Even allowing for such an adjustment, the objective seriousness of these offences still requires a very substantial period of imprisonment. The sentence which I propose is imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of 8 1/2 years and a balance of term of 4 1/2 years. 

77The orders which I propose are as follows: 

(1) Leave to appeal granted. 
(2) The appeal is allowed. 
(3) The sentences imposed by her Honour on 13 August 2010 are quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows: 

(i) In relation to count 1, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years to commence on 27 October 2009 and to expire on 26 October 2011. 

(ii) In respect of count 6, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years to commence on 27 October 2010 and to expire on 26 October 2012. 

(iii) In relation to count 5, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 27 April 2012 and expiring 26 April 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 26 April 2017. 

(iv) In relation to count 3, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 27 April 2014 and expiring 26 April 2018 with a balance of term of 4 1/2 years expiring 26 October 2022.

		20 October 2011",2011-10-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709054,R v CHAN [2011] NSWDC 227,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Arthur Rodney Chan has been charged by police with breaching a road rule, that being road rule 287 which specifies what a driver must do after having been involved in a crash. He was convicted of this offence in the court below and appeals to this Court against his conviction.

2The Crown tendered the transcripts and exhibits from the court below but it was agreed between the parties that I need not read any of that material because of the relative lack of any factual dispute and because the argument in this Court is based on the law and not evidence. Having been told of what the evidence was and having received submissions as to the law I am content to deal with the matter in the way in which the parties want me to.

3Briefly this is what occurred. The appellant is a taxi driver. He stopped his taxi to let a passenger out. The passenger opened the right hand rear door. A bus collided with the door. The bus driver and Mr Chan, the appellant, spoke to each other. The bus driver requested that Mr Chan provide his particulars. Mr Chan did not provide his particulars to the bus driver. 

4It is Mr Chan's case that for reasons Mr Goh explained he did not want to tell the driver of his particulars until the police arrived. The bus driver had passengers on his bus and so eventually he gave up and left without Mr Chan telling the bus driver such things as Mr Chan's name and address. In those circumstances, as I said, Mr Chan was charged with a breach of r 287. Subsection (2) requires, amongst other matters, that Mr Chan, within the time that is defined as being as soon as possible but in any case within twenty-four hours, if practicable, at the scene of the crash tell the bus driver things he did not tell him.

5Mr Goh submits however that subs (2) is subject to subs (3) which provides: 

""The driver must also give the driver's required particulars within the required time to a police officer if...the driver does not for any reason give the driver's required particulars to each person mentioned in sub rule (2).""

6Thus Mr Goh says that subs (3) provides in effect an option for a driver involved in a crash that he or she can either comply with subs (2) or subs (3). Mr Goh illustrated his submission by postulating the following scenario. A driver drives his or her vehicle in a way which collides with another car. The driver of that other car is aggressive, upset at his car being damaged. In those circumstances the driver who caused the collision may well be prepared to give particulars to the police but may be fearful of disclosing the driver's name and address to an aggressive, aggrieved person. Mr Goh says that Parliament could not have intended that such a person would be guilty of an offence. 

7On the other hand the Crown's submission is that it is my job to interpret the legislation and if the legislation provides that the driver in the postulated situation is guilty of an offence then it is my duty to apply the legislation even if unforseen consequences flow.

8I am not at all sure that even in the postulated situation the driver would be guilty of an offence. Some close examination of the defence of necessity might be appropriate if anyone were charged in that situation. But I do accept the Crown's submission that it is my duty to interpret the legislation using the words that appear in the section as the first port of call.

9The difficulty with Mr Goh's submission is that his argument would either ignore the word ""also"" or give it an interpretation which is not consistent with my understanding of the everyday meaning of that word. The word ""also"" means ""in addition to"". It does not mean ""instead of"". It is possible to interpret subs (3)(b). the words ""for any reason in particular"" in a way which is consistent with giving the word its natural, everyday meaning. Indeed the words ""for any reason"" are probably superfluous. All they mean is that should a driver not comply with subs (2) then they have an obligation under subs (3) to provide particulars to police. For example if the other driver did not request particulars or drove away then the driver could not comply with subs (2). There would be a reason that there was no compliance. Nevertheless the observation under subs (3) would arise.

10There are various aids to the interpretation of a statute but one of the important ones is that I must give effect to each word in a section. I must give effect to the word ""also"" in subs (3). When I do that I must therefore reject the argument put by Mr Goh. It is possible that this has unintended consequences but that is not a matter for me but for Parliament.

11The appeal against conviction is dismissed and the conviction is confirmed.

		03 May 2012",2011-10-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709066,R v Stephen Leslie HILL [2011] NSWSC 1196,"VERDICT 

1Stephen Leslie Hill is charged with the murder of his partner, Michel Carroll, at Wamberal on 16 June 2010. Well before the date fixed for the commencement of his trial he elected for trial by Judge alone and the Crown agreed. Accordingly, I am constituted as the Judge of the law and the facts. 

2The accused and the deceased lived at Wamberal on the Central Coast. Also living with them was a teenage child of the deceased by a former relationship, whom I shall call 'L'. At the time of the events giving rise to the charge they had been in that relationship for eight years. In April 2010 the deceased gave birth to a child, conceived through IVF. The accused is the biological father of the child. During the latter years of the relationship the behaviour of the accused became a matter of serious concern for the deceased, her relations and associates. He was described as exhibiting controlling and abusing behaviour towards 'L' and her. 

3The accused was employed by AMP Society. He had in the past offered financial advice to the deceased and her parents. He was experiencing problems in the course of his business. There was a suspicion of fraud or theft by business partners. The deceased was the accused's employee, or perhaps partner in that business. He began blaming her for the failings of the business. He appeared to others to be paranoid about a number of things. For example, he believed that people were listening to his telephone conversations and had planted listening devices in his house. He believed that people were hacking into his computer. He thought that his employer was spying on him. He believed that the deceased was cheating on him and that their baby was not his. He felt that the IVF clinic was involved. He demanded that the deceased undergo a lie detector test to determine whether he were the father of the child and to ascertain whether she knew the combination of his safe. 

4On occasions the accused shouted at the deceased and criticised her in the presence of others. 

5The accused and the deceased were alone together at their house on 16 June 2010. In the afternoon 'L' returned home. He noticed water running out of the house and across the balcony. He ran to the back of the house and smelt smoke coming from inside the house. He entered the house and noticed blood smears across the floor. The kitchen was in disarray. He went to the bedroom and saw the deceased's half-naked body lying on the floor of the adjacent bathroom. The accused was lying on the floor next to her. 'L' noticed a wound to the deceased's leg and saw an object, which turned out to be the handle of a knife, protruding from her nose. He rang for help and ambulance and police officers attended. They found the body of the deceased. There were numerous facial injuries including stab wounds and deep lacerations to the forehead. The skull was badly damaged with loss of brain tissue. There were numerous stab wounds to the back, buttocks, neck and abdomen, ranging from superficial to incised wounds. A hammer and a bloodstained knife were found nearby. 

6The accused was present and the police took him away. He was assessed as being intoxicated or under the influence of prescription medicine because of his impaired movement and speech. He told ambulance officers something about the drugs he had taken. He was taken to Gosford hospital for observation because of concerns for his health. While he was under police guard at the hospital he lashed out at one of the officers while she was attempting to subdue him, kicking her in the back. 

7Blood samples were taken from the accused which showed on analysis the presence of Alprazolam, a Benzodiazepine, well within the toxic range. The toxic effects of that drug include drowsiness, confusion, hypotension, tachycardia, palpitations, nausea and muscle tremors. Persons taking drugs in such quantities have been recorded as experiencing anger, hostility, manic symptoms, insomnia, nightmares and self-mutilatory impulses. 

8At about 11pm the accused was discharged from the hospital and the police took him to the police station. They interviewed him and made an electronic record of what was said. It is the opinion of Dr Perl, pharmacologist, and of Dr Furst and of Professor Greenberg, psychiatrists, that the accused was not fit to be interviewed. A transcript of the interview has been put before the Court. I will not deal with the detail of it and observe merely that the things the accused is recorded as having said go some way to show what a parlous state of mind he was in at the time. 

9The report of Dr Perl shows also that the accused had taken a sleeping tablet, Zolpidem. Dr Perl could not say whether he would have been impaired by that drug when he killed the deceased. If he was, that would have been additional to the impairment resulting from the Alprazolam. These were prescription medicines. 

10An autopsy was held and a report prepared for the Coroner. It showed that death was caused by a blunt force head trauma and a complex pattern of stab wounds. The injuries were multiple and varied. There were a number of blunt force injuries to the head, which could have been inflicted by the hammer found at the scene. The head injury would have caused rapid death. The other injuries were inflicted peri mortem or post mortem . 

11The accused was taken to the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, Silverwater where he was noted to be very mentally unwell. Staff were recorded as being unable to attend basic observations due, among other things, to the unpredictability of his actions. 

12I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did the act that caused the death of the deceased with the intent to kill her. On this evidence, without more, the accused is liable to be found guilty of the murder of the deceased. 

13However, the accused has pleaded that he is not guilty by reason of mental illness. The burden of proving that an accused person who is otherwise liable to be found to have committed an offence is not guilty by reason of mental illness lies not upon the Crown but on the accused himself. He must prove what he asserts on the balance of probabilities, which is to say that he must make it appear more likely than not that he was at the time suffering from a mental illness sufficient to give him that defence. 

14When this defence is raised the question to be answered is whether when the act constituting the offence was committed the accused was suffering from a defect of reason from a disease of the mind so as not to know the quality and the nature of the act that he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The law has been amplified in Australia in recent years and the test may be said to be whether the accused was able to appreciate the wrongness of the act that he was doing. If through disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. It may also be said that if a disease of the mind so governs the faculties that it is impossible to reason with some moderate degree of calmness about the moral quality of an act, the actor is prevented from knowing that what he does is wrong. 

15The accused's solicitor asked Dr Furst to interview the accused and provide a report. Dr Furst had previously seen the accused on 28 June 2010, some two weeks after the death of the deceased. He complied with the solicitor's request and saw him on 7 January 2011, when he interviewed him for about 90 minutes. Before speaking to the accused, Dr Furst read as much as was necessary to inform him about the history of the accused and the deceased, including the statements of ambulance, police and civilian witnesses, medical records, the autopsy report, the transcript of the interview between the accused and the investigating police officers and other relevant documents. Dr Furst wrote a report on 7 February 2011. The report includes these passages: - 

PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY 

Mr Hill told me that he had experienced one previous period of paranoia in 2003 when he believed people were calling him in for interviews and was being ""heavied by AMP because of my behaviours and the way I did business."" He thought they were going to terminate him at the time. 

He also described a history of periods in which he was high in mood prior to 2005; such as feeling he could ""do anything"" and ""couldn't be beaten."" He said he had been the National champion for AMP and felt ""gifted."" He also said there were times when he felt invincible, was full of energy, and did not need to sleep for several days on end. He did not spend excessively or take too many risks, which one would often expect in a manic episode. 

He had not been admitted to a psychiatric hospital prior to his arrest and had no previous history of deliberate self-harm or suicide attempts. 

ACCOUNT OF INDEX OFFENCE 

I asked Mr Hill about the events in question. He told me that his memory was ""hazy...no content...I don't remember it"" He said he did not know where he was or what had happened and did not recall being taken to Gosford Hospital or being interviewed by Police. 

However, he did recall having a conversation with Michel early on the morning of the index offence, where she was talking to him and said something like, ""Is that the question you wanted to ask?"" He could not recall the nature of the question he asked her; however he said her response ""set off alarm bells and panic."" 

He denied arguing with Michel that day and specifically denied arguing about money. He did not think that she hit him. He thought that his first memory of that day was Michel attending to their baby. 

In relation to events on the previous day, 15/06/10, Mr Hill did not recall anything. He said he had returned from a trip to Melbourne on 14/06/10, having spent the previous two-weeks in Melbourne staying at hotels and at his mother's house. He told me that he was ""OK"" in his mood; however he then added 'I was belligerent towards Michel as I was thinking about the infidelity between her and 'L's' friends"" when he was in Melbourne. 

He was suicidal at the time of the events in question and took three bottles of Xanax (about 100 tablets) and one bottle of Stillnox (about 20 tablets), together with a bottle of the Beta-blocker Inderal (about 50 tablets). He said that he wanted to die at the time, and the amount of tablets he consumed was potentially life-threatening. 

Mr Hill also said that the idea of killing Michel and killing himself had entered his mind on occasions between May and June 2010 because he thought she was having affairs and had ""hurt me in that way"" and because of the business. He denied making any special preparations to kill her. 

PROGRESS SINCE INDEX OFFENCE 

Mr Hill said that he heard 'voices"" after his reception into custody at the MRRC in June 2010. He told me that ""they were amazing"" in that he was listening to the television and could hear the broadcast of people behind him. He said that the show was on one level; however the people behind were broadcasting a couple of voices ""to annoy me."" He recalls that one was an ""impersonation of a Lebanese bloke"" and that ""one was trying to bet into numbers."" 

He also experienced visions of himself being crucified, which was probably an example of a visual hallucination. He was not sure at the time if he was in gaol, or if he had been crucified, which was probably a measure of the confusion he was experiencing as a product of his psychosis. He then developed the belief that he had killed three Aboriginal children when he had travelled to Melbourne in the period prior to the index offence; seeing a vision of himself ""dropping a microphone from a News helicopter"" and being told by someone in gaol he had killed his niece and nephew. He was distressed by this until he eventually realized there had been no such events. 

Mr Hill was admitted to the Long Bay Hospital as a Correctional Patient under the Mental Health Act from 22/07/10 to 15/10/10. He said that he had been diagnosed with Schizophrenia and had been treated with medication by Dr Gerald Chew, a psychiatrist working for Justice Health, and his registrar, Dr Kheng Chan. He said he had been diagnosed with Schizophrenia and had been treated with medication. His detention in the Hospital had been supervised by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 

He said that his mood had remained ""depressed"" because of the ""situation he was in"" and that he continued to experience suicidal thoughts at times. He was anxious around other inmates, being superficially pleasant but not especially close to anyone. He was being managed in Hamden, the mental health 'pod' at the MRRC, where he saw a psychiatrist about once a month and was being treated with a combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. He said that he was sleeping more; however his appetite was less than usual. His memory and concentration had improved somewhat. He told me that the medication had helped, stating ""I seem to realise that what I was thinking was skewed."" 


16Dr Furst noted that between 1996 and 2004 the accused was drinking excessively, a bottle of scotch whisky on most days, though since 2004 he had decreased his drinking somewhat. His use of Xanax (Alprazolam) was probably still excessive in that he took two to three 2 mg tablets per day. He was using the sleeping tablet up to once a week. 

17Dr Furst commented upon the transcript of the interview between investigating police and the accused. He commented on inappropriate and disconnected responses, and apparent confusion by simple questions and an inability to remember what had happened on the previous day at the time of his arrest or when being attended to by ambulance officers. He made detailed reference to the many statements and reports with which he had been furnished. 

18Dr Furst diagnosed schizophrenia, paranoid type, alcohol dependence and social anxiety disorder. One of the things Dr Furst had been asked to consider was whether the accused was mentally ill at the time of the commission of his offence. He said: - 

Mr Hill was delusional about AMP and ASIC monitoring him and believed that they were persecuting him. His delusional, beliefs extended to Michel Carroll as his defacto wife and employee, in that he believed she was involved in monitoring him. He also believed that she was having affairs with 'L's' friends and doubted the paternity of his newborn child. The extent of his paranoia was such that he organized for a 'lie-detector' test at Sydney Airport through an expert flown in from interstate. He also organized a DNA test to check the paternity of the baby; however there was evidence that he doubted the results of those tests. 

At the time in question, Mr Hill was severely depressed, not coping, and was increasingly bizarre in his behaviour as a product of his delusions. His son 'L' said in a statement to Police, he was ""Paranoid, accused my mother and myself of recording phone calls, and hacking into his computer - nearly every day,"" He apparently took his power cord from his laptop, his Internet prepaid dongle and TV remote were missing. 'L' said there were fights about money, and that Mr Hill was accusing him and Michel of recording him and stealing his stuff. 

John Carroll said that Steve was paranoid that AMP were watching him. He often commented that someone was hacking his computer, bugging his phone, sabotaging him."" Paranoid about being audited. Paranoid someone was targeting him. Steve was always saying someone was out to get him. 

Although there was evidence of conflict between Mr Hill and the deceased, I would regard this as a product of his disorganised and paranoid thinking about the business, his belief that Michel was involved in monitoring him, and his unshakable belief that she was having affairs with 'L's' friends. 

In my opinion, at the time of the killing of his defacto, he was labouring under a defect of reason in the form of paranoid delusions about the deceased as a product of his schizophrenic illness, which has been recognised at law as a disease of the mind. His delusional beliefs most likely prevented him from knowing that his actions were wrong in a moral sense and deprived him of the capacity to reason about his actions with a moderate degree of sense or composure. I believe he has the mental illness defence available to him. 


19Dr Furst wrote another report on 27 March 2011, having seen the video disc of the police interview. He remained of the opinion he had previously expressed. He wrote a third report on 10 June 2011 having seen a toxicology report by Dr Perl and a psychiatric report by Professor Greenberg, written at that request of the Crown. His opinion remained unchanged. 

20That brings me to the report of Professor Greenberg, who saw the accused on 8 and 29 April 2011 and wrote a report on 6 May 2011. He was provided with all the necessary documentation. His medical opinion was much like that of Dr Furst, the diagnosis being schizophrenic disorder, alcohol dependence disorder, benzodiazepine dependent disorder and a history of social anxiety disorder. 

21Professor Greenberg considered whether the accused had available to him the defence of mental illness. He said this: - 

I am of the opinion that Mr Hill was likely suffering from a disease of the mind at the time period surrounding the alleged offences. As stated I am of the opinion that Mr Hill likely was suffering from a variety of delusions including delusions of infidelity, delusions of reference about TV and delusions of paranoia involving his de facto partner being in a conspiracy with AMP and ASIC. I am of the opinion that Mr Hill was suffering from a psychotic disorder with prominent delusions. I note that based on the information available, he has not suffered from prominent hallucinations or form of thought disorder (disorganised speech) or grossly disorganised behaviour prior to alleged offence. He likely has a psychotic Illness probably that of a Schizophrenic Disorder. As stated I am of the view that he suffered and is suffering from a schizophrenic disorder, although It is unusual for a late onset of this illness. As a differential diagnosis I am of the view that he may have a substance induced psychotic disorder due to him taking a medication called sibutramine associated with Xanax and Stilnox medication although the evidence for this is relatively poor at this time. 

I am of the opinion that the accused was labouring under a defect of reason caused by the disease of the mind. It is alleged that Mr Hill smashed his wife's skull from the back whilst she was lying in bed ... . It is also noted by the police and forensic pathologists that in the peri-mortem and post-mortem period Mr Hill likely committed the following acts including dragging her body into the bathroom; inflicting cuts to the victim's face, neck, abdomen and back; inserting two hair brushes into her hair; inserting what appears to be a kitchen knife into the right nostril of the victim ... and smeared the victim's face with lipstick. It is also likely that Mr Hill allegedly walked around the house leaving a trail of blood. He possibly cut his foot on the smashed microwave plate which was on the kitchen floor. It is noted that he allegedly entered his de-facto partner's son's bedroom and possibly damaged 'L's' electrical equipment with the hammer and left the blood-stained hammer hanging on the cupboard door in 'L's' room. It is noted that the house was in a somewhat disarrayed and disrepaired state. 

In my view the nature of the offence was psychotically based in that the extent of force utilized in the homicide and the bizarre nature of the offence would be more consistent with a defect of reason and an irrational psychotic mind at that time period. 

22Professor Greenberg concluded that in his opinion the accused likely did not know the nature or the quality of his act at the time of the alleged offence and that he did not know that it was wrong at that time. 

23I remind myself that the tribunal of fact has a duty to make up its own mind on the issues for trial, taking into account all the evidence. Where the evidence is of expert opinion, that opinion may be weighed in the light of other evidence. The tribunal of fact may even reject expert opinion by reference to other evidence in the case. There is no cause here to do such a thing, however. The opinions of Dr Furst and Professor Greenberg are unchallenged, so the Court should accept and act on them. I conclude, as they have opined, that the accused has discharged the burden of establishing the availability of the defence of mental illness. 

24It is necessary to say a number of other things. The events giving rise to the charge must have been distressing and perplexing for the family of Ms Carroll and for others closely concerned. The sympathy of the Court goes out to the family and all those who have been touched by these tragic events. It is to be hoped that now that the Court hearing is over those concerned may gain some peace of mind. 

25The statute which governs cases like this empowers me to make an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. I propose to make such an order. In practice that means that under the provisions of New South Wales mental health legislation the accused will be referred as a forensic patient to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. A strict statutory regime will then come into effect. 

26The Mental Health Review Tribunal is a body consisting of a president or a deputy president and other members, including legal practitioners, psychiatrists and persons who in the opinion of the Governor have qualifications or experience which suit them for service on the Tribunal. 

27As soon as possible after my verdict the Tribunal will commence a review of the accused's case. When it has done its review it can make an order as to the manner in which the accused should be detained, cared for or treated. 

28The Tribunal can at any later time, and must periodically, review his case. Following any such further review the Tribunal can order the manner in which the accused is to be detained, cared for or treated. It can also order his release, conditionally or unconditionally. As it considers the accused's case from time to time, the Tribunal is, of course concerned about the accused himself, his state of mental health in particular and how he should be housed and treated. But there are wider considerations, and the legislation requires that when reviewing his case the Tribunal consider not only whether care, treatment or control of the accused is necessary for his own protection but also how to ensure the protection of others from serious harm. If there is a proposal to release the accused, a report from a forensic psychiatrist or other responsible person not involved in the accused's treatment must be received, dealing with his condition and whether his safety or the safety of any member of the public would be seriously endangered if he were released. 

29The Tribunal cannot order the release of a forensic patient unless one of its members is or has been a Judge. If the Tribunal proposes to release a forensic patient it must inform the Minister for Health and the Attorney General and they may make submissions about the matter. 

30One may summarise one of the principal purposes of the legislation by saying that the intention is that the accused will never be released from his confinement unless the Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered. 

31I find that the accused is not guilty by reason of mental illness of the charge that he murdered Michel Carroll. I order that he be detained in the psychiatric ward of the hospital at Long Bay Correctional Centre or such other place as may be determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

		12 October 2011",2011-10-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709080,R v Kobeissi [2011] NSWDC 268,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The Offender Khalil Kobeissi appears for sentence consequent upon his pleading guilty on 26 July 2011 to an armed robbery that he committed upon the victim Luciano Ippoliti at Burwood on 14 August 2009. This offence has a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, no standard non-parole period and cannot be dealt with summarily. 

2When considering deterrence and retribution the Court took into account two matters of obtaining money by deception on a Form 1 Schedule.

3The Offender pleaded guilty when he was due to face trial in relation to a more serious matter under subs 97(2). In terms of utility, the Court is of the view that the plea was entered late and reduced his sentence by about 10% to reflect the utility of the guilty plea. Having satisfied itself that the conditions referred to in sub para 21A(3)(i) are met and he is remorseful, the Court further reduced his sentence because of remorse.

4On 14 August 2009 the victim went to his friend's place which is located in Burwood Road, Burwood, to visit his friend. His friend, Mr Awad, owns a florist shop and occupies a unit located above the florist shop. When the victim approached the rear gate to his friend's premises, the co-offender Aytac Kusdemi approached, spoke to the victim and told him that Mr Awad was not home and would be back in about an hour. 

5The victim then attended to some personal business and telephoned Mr Awad who told him he could wait for him at his house upstairs. As a result, the victim returned to his friend's unit to find that the co-offender was still at the back gate. He told the co-offender about the phone call and then went upstairs and started watching a movie on the television whilst waiting for his friend to return.

6After a period of time this Offender entered the room and told the victim that his friend Mr Awad was downstairs in the florist shop. The victim got up and made his way down the hallway and into a home office. He saw the co-offender seated at the desk and approached the desk. When he turned around, the victim noticed that the Offender had an object that appeared like a rifle in his hand. The Offender told the victim to sit down and empty his pockets. The victim emptied his pockets, placing his wallet, keys and cigarettes on the table. The Offender went through the victim's wallet and took out an NAB card and a Qantas Credit Union card. During this time the item that appeared like a rifle was pointed in the direction of the victim and the Offender told him to write down his PIN number on a post-it note. It seems that the victim complied and, after telling his co-offender to stay with the victim, the Offender left the victim and his co-offender. The events just related give rise to the offence of armed robbery to which he pleaded guilty.

7The Offender walked to a National Australia Bank ATM and withdrew $400 using the victim's Credit Union card. He attempted to withdraw money, using the victim's NAB card but failed. It was apparently 10.30 when he made the withdrawal. The Offender returned to the unit. Apparently the victim and the co-offender were still there and he threw the credit cards and the ATM receipts on the table and complained that he could only get $400 out of the ATM. He told the victim that they would have to wait until after midnight for the credit card limit to go back to $1,000. He and the co-offender spoke for a period of time. 

8At one point, when the victim went to grab for his mobile phone, the Offender ran over and smacked him across the face. No charge has been laid in relation to this. It is simply part of the background in connection with the remaining matter on the Form 1 Schedule. The Court should add at this point, the withdrawal of the $400 gives rise to one of the offences on the Form 1 Schedule.

9The victim's friend, Mr Awad then came and the Offender told him that they were just mucking around. Apparently Mr Awad starting cleaning around the victim and was coming in and out of the room. 

10Shortly afterwards the Offender left and went to an ATM and withdrew $500 from the ATM. This gives rise to the other offence on the Form 1 Schedule. He returned to the premises and showed the victim the money and returned the victim's credit cards to him. He took the victim's driver's licence but this was apparently later recovered by the victim's friend. However, the victim's friend was unable to recover the victim's money on his behalf. The victim left. After driving around for a period of time, he contacted the police.

11The Offender was 25 when he committed this offence. He is now 27 years of age. He has an older brother and sister.

12He was suspended from high school during Year 9 and did not return to school. After leaving school he undertook a number of courses at TAFE and worked casually as a cleaner and as a tiler. The Court notes that he also participated in boxing and kick boxing and ultimately became a trainer in these sports. It seems that up until 2008 he did not abuse either drugs or liquor.

13The Offender does not have the benefit of prior good character. On 9 February 2006 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years with 12 months non-parole that was suspended for an aggravated robbery. The Court notes that there was some presentence custody in connection with that matter to which the Court will refer in due course.

14On 8 August 2006 he was ordered to perform community service for stealing from a person and demanding property whilst in company. It seems that the Community Service order for the latter was subsequently revoked and he was fined.

15On 1 May 2008 he was dealt with for larceny, convicted rather in his absence for larceny, which was later dealt with by way of s 10A.

16The Offender has been in custody since his arrest on 11 August 2010. He has not breached any prison discipline rules. The Court notes that he has done a course in word processing.

17The Offender was bail refused for the aggravated robbery between 26 April 2005 and 13 July of the same year. He was attacked by a group of inmates on 16 May 2005, sustaining a puncture a wound to his scapula and a wound to his head. The Court is satisfied that as a consequence of this attack, he suffers post-traumatic stress disorder. This was diagnosed early in 2008 and a cognitive behaviour therapy was recommended. It seems that he did not undertake that therapy. Part of the problem may have been his poor memory so far as appointments is concerned and also no-one being available to take him to appointments.

18He also has an intellectual disability at the borderline level that places him in the lowest 3% of the population. It is possible that this is due to brain damage. This has not been confirmed by a neuropsychological testing. It is possible that if he suffered brain damage that it is a consequence of the assault in 2005.

19Amongst other things, the implications so far as his intellectual disabilities are, that he has marked difficulties:


in attention and concentration;


understanding the implications of verbal communications;


reasoning and expressing thoughts; and


applying common sense to the thought process.

20The High Court earlier this week in the decision of Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 had caused a comment upon the impact of an intellectual disability in the sentencing process. In the course of doing so, they quoted a passage from a New South Wales Law Reform Commission discussion paper apparently published in 1994. The passage is set out in para 50 of the judgment of the Court. It reads as follows:

""A person's intellectual disability can be classified as 'mild', 'moderate', 'severe' or 'profound', based upon certain IQ (intelligence quotient) ranges. A further category, 'borderline' is also used to indicate people just above the mild range in terms of intellectual functioning. A person with a 'severe' or 'profound' disability may be unable to learn basic skills such as speech, walking and personal care and is likely to require supported accommodation. The majority of people with an intellectual disability have a 'mild' level of intellectual disability and 'can learn skills of reading, writing, numeracy, and daily living sufficient to enable them to live independently in the community'. These classifications have limited utility and can sometimes be misleading. For example, such terms may suggest to criminal justice personnel, who do not have a full understanding of the disability involved, that a 'mild' intellectual disability is inconsequential.""


Their Honours went on to say:


""The fact that the appellant had engaged in some paid employment and that he held a driver's licence does not detract from the assessment of his retardation. The evidence was that he had 'enormous difficulty with employment'.""


21There is limited evidence about the Offender's ability to function independently in the community in this case. The Court does note that, whilst in custody, he has done a word processing course of some sort, the details of which are not revealed in the evidence. The Court notes also that he was able to operate an ATM machine to withdraw money and appreciated that he may be able to withdraw more money after midnight because of the limitations on daily withdrawals. Mr Jacmon in his report comments on none of these matters. Mr Jacmon, in his report exhibit 3B, refers to the Offender starting to abuse drugs some time in 2008 to cope with his problems. There is some evidence from Ms Pike today that she observed indications of drug use in the Offender.

22Mr Jacmon in his report of 2011, which is exhibit 3B, reaches the conclusion that the Offender has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. There is no such opinion expressed in his report exhibit 3A, which is dated 2008, and nor does he comment upon this difference and other differences in results from testing that he administered between [should read in] 2008 and 2011. As the Court observed during the tendering process, it raises questions about the weight that should be given to some aspects of this individual's reports in this particular case, which is confirmed by his response in exhibit 3D. The Court is not persuaded in the circumstances that the Offender has ADHD, or suffered from it at the time of the commission of the offence.

23The circumstances are such that the Court is satisfied in the case of this Offender that the offence was premeditated. Not only did he have the item that he used as a weapon, but he was in company. It seems that he orchestrated the situation to bring the victim into the office where the co-offender was. The weapon he used looked like a firearm but there was no evidence that it was a firearm, although it may have been capable, depending on how it was used, of inflicting some injury. There were no threats apart from those implied by the use of the gun. There was no corporal violence perpetrated during the course of the robbery but the Court does note the slap in the context of events that unfolded leading up to the second time that he went to take money out of the ATM.

24The two cards that were stolen were returned to the victim but the money taken from the ATM machines was not. They of course are not the proceeds of the robbery but are the proceeds of the offences on the Form 1 Schedule.

25Obviously the victim was very frightened. There is no victim impact statement in this case but it is possible that the victim may have suffered longterm emotional or psychological problems. Although there are some factors in this case that distinguished it from the decision in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R , that guideline judgment is still relevant. Because of his mental health and intellectual disability, the Offender's moral culpability is less. Deterrence has little relevance and less weight was given to retribution and denunciation. Greater weight was given to rehabilitation. 

26In the circumstances the Court is satisfied that his prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending are reasonable and came to this conclusion bearing in mind his family and community support.

27Judge Johnstone sentenced the co-offender on 15 October 2010 after the co-offender pleaded guilty to an offence under subs 97(2). Taking into account one matter of obtain by deception on a Form 1 Schedule, his Honour imposed a sentence of 4½ years imprisonment with 2½ years nonparole.

28The similarities, so far as the evidence reveals, between the two Offenders are as follows:


their age;


both have post traumatic stress disorder;


both used illicit drugs to self-medicate;


their prospects of rehabilitation;


custody being more burdensome because of their mental health; and


in this man's case, his intellectual disability.

29The dissimilarities, so far as the evidence reveals, between the two are that:


unlike this man, the co-offender had no prior conviction involving robbery. His record comprised motor traffic offences and one matter of public nuisance in Queensland;


unlike this man, he had one, rather than two matters on a Form 1 Schedule; 
 

unlike this Offender, the co-offender did not have an intellectual disability; 
 

the co-offender received the discount of 25% for the utility of his guilty plea; 
 

His Honour found that the co-offender's involvement was spontaneous; and 
 

the co-offender pleaded guilty and was therefore sentenced in relation to a more serious matter which has a greater maximum penalty. Although, having said that, in terms of their roles, there is nothing significant to distinguish between them. 

30Bearing those matters in mind, the Court applied the principle of parity. 

31Subject to what the Court has already said in relation to the purposes of sentence, the Court consider the other purposes of sentence referred to in s 3A and that a custodial sentence is a sentence of last resort. The Court concluded that a custodial sentence is called for in this case. It found special circumstances because of his need for an extended period of time on supervised parole.

32Khalil Kobeissi, the Court convicts you and sentences you to imprisonment. It fixes a non-parole period of 2 years and a total term of 45 months to commence on 31 August 2010. The Court orders your parole eligibility date is 30 August 2012. If I have not said so, I have taken the two matters on the Form 1 into account when sentencing him.

33I have sentenced you to 45 months with 2 years non-parole commencing on the date of your arrest. That means you will become eligible for release to parole on 30 August next year. Release to parole on that date is not automatic. You will have to go before the State Parole Board, they will hold a hearing and decide whether they will let you out on parole that day or some other day. If you were released to parole you will be subject to stringent conditions that you should understand. If you do not understand, you are going to have to ask people to explain them to you. If you commit any offences whilst on your parole, do not do as your parole officer says, or breach other conditions of your parole, the State Parole Authority will revoke your parole and you will have to go back to gaol to serve the balance of the sentence. Do you understand?

34OFFENDER: Yes.

		19 February 2014",2011-10-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709085,R v MATAR [2011] NSWDC 208,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Amgad Matar was responsible for a lengthy period of sustained violence during which he assaulted his wife, causing her significant and serious injuries. Indeed, photographs tendered to me showing the external injuries suffered by the victim in this matter reveal extensive injuries over virtually every part of Ms Zaki's body. Those injuries are entirely consistent with the sustained violence to which she was subject at the hands of the offender. The Crown tendered a statement by Dr Maria Nittis, who has been a doctor since around 1990. She also looked at the photographs and said this: 

""The bruising is extensive and the worst I have seen in my professional career."" 

2I have to say that, despite many years involvement in the criminal law, my assessment is the same. The bruising to Ms Zaki's right arm and right thigh in particular is disturbing to look at. 

3The offender pleaded guilty in this Court to two offences: (1) that on 2 October 2009 he assaulted Ms Zaki thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm; and (2) he also pleaded guilty to a charge that on 17 October 2009 he recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to Ms Zaki. The Crown explained that the grievous bodily harm on which he relied for that offence was a subdural haematoma. When I sentence him for the recklessly causing grievous bodily harm matter, the offender asked that I take into account five further offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 3 October, 4 October, 7 October, on or about 10 October and 16 October 2009. It is clear from the dates of the offences offences alone that this was a sustained period of violence. 

4The offender and Ms Zaki were married in Egypt in 1999. They came to Australia in 2000. It is important to understand that at the time of the offences I am about to describe, Mr Matar was psychiatrically unwell. He was hearing voices. He gave evidence that the voices told him both that his wife had been unfaithful and that he should hit her. 

5On 2 October 2009, Ms Zaki spoke to a priest about her marriage. When the offender learned what had happened, he accused Ms Zaki of speaking to the priest for sexual gratification. When he got home from work he told her to go to the kitchen and stay there until he let her come out. He wrote out a list of questions for her to answer. He then called her into the bedroom and asked whether she had been unfaithful to him. She denied that she had which, somewhat surprisingly, angered the offender. He picked up a plastic chair and, using that as a weapon, hit Ms Zaki with it to her legs and arms. He continued doing this until it broke. He did not stop, though. He then picked up a toy gun and used that as a weapon, too, again hitting Ms Zaki with it many times until it broke. 

6Of course, given the other offences that I am about to describe, it is impossible to attribute particular bruising to a particular offence, but Ms Zaki said that her legs were so sore from the assault that I have just described that she could not stand up. The offence I have just referred to is the first for which the offender must be specifically sentenced. The next five offences appear on the Form 1. 

7The offender again wrote out questions he wanted to ask Ms Zaki when he returned from work. He began examining her mobile phone. He wanted to know where the number for the priest was. Ms Zaki told him that she had deleted it because she was scared. He then started to go through the mobile phone, asking Ms Zaki about the phone numbers stored in it. When she was not able to tell him some matters that he wanted to know, he became angry and began hitting her with his fists, all over her face and head. This continued for several hours resulting in swelling to Ms Zaki's eyes and head. 

8The following day the offender required that his wife compile a list of the telephone numbers in her mobile phone and who they related to. A few days later, when the offender wanted to know where an old pillow was, and Ms Zaki told him that she had thrown it out because it was torn, he became angry and punched her in the head. Not surprisingly the pain that Ms Zaki felt on this occasion was exacerbated because she was being punched on top of her already swollen and bruised face. Not only was she fearing physical pain, but during the assault the offender said, ""I want to kill you."" 

9We next move to 7 October. The offender again abused Ms Zaki about talking to priests about their marriage and began hitting her. Somewhat remarkably, the offender complained about the pain he was experiencing. I repeat, it was the offender who complained about pain that he was suffering. He was suffering from this pain in his hand and arm because he had been hitting Ms Zaki. That he was concerned about his injuries and the pain that he felt, rather than Ms Zaki's condition, says a lot about the offender and the position he was in at the time. Ms Zaki gave him some Panadol, but all that seems to have done is to allow the offender to resume assaulting his wife. The statement of facts records, "" When the accused felt better he hit the complainant again with the same hand . "" 

10There were a number of large cardboard cylinders at the home. A photograph of one of them was tendered. It is clearly an item which is not as dangerous as a baseball bat or something heavier, but it was capable of inflicting injury and it did. The offender grabbed one of those cardboard cylinders and began hitting Ms Zaki with it. This assault continued all night, causing further bruising to Ms Zaki's face and legs. 

11On the weekend of 10 October, the offender again began questioning Ms Zaki about what she had said to the priests. Throughout this conversation, the offender was hitting Ms Zaki. In fact, he hit her so hard that she fell off a chair. He hit her on her legs, her arms and on her side. He hit her on her left side so much that she could not even bend over. He threw her onto the bed and stomped on her back with his feet very hard. That he would use his feet to inflict injury only makes this offence worse than it would otherwise have been. He pulled her hair, he wrapped his hands around her head and neck and moved her head from side to side. He then went and got a knife. Fortunately, it seems, at this stage one of their three children, who was born in 2002, came into the room and the offender stopped. Later that day the offender used the large cardboard cylinder again to hit Ms Zaki around the body and he punched her in the face as well. Ms Zaki was in a lot of pain and could barely walk. 

12On 16 October, Ms Zaki got home from collecting keys for a house that she had leased. Again the offender said ""I want to ask you some questions"". Ms Zaki put the children to bed he began accusing her of infidelity, and again began hitting her and beating her all over the body using both his hands and the cardboard cylinder. 

13We now come to the most serious offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. On 17 October the offender again began questioning Ms Zaki about what he said was her infidelity, and again he was hitting her with his fists, hitting her to the face and to her torso. He punched her in the kidneys. After one punch to her torso in the area of her liver, Ms Zaki screamed because of the pain that she felt. It appears from medical evidence that this blow had actually caused a laceration in Ms Zaki's liver, which is no doubt why she suffered the pain that she did. 

14In response to having caused such a significant injury to his wife that she would scream, the offender simply said, ""Shush, I don't want to hear your voice again,"" and continued to beat her. Once more he picked up the cardboard cylinder and struck Ms Zaki repeatedly. This assault caused such significant swelling to Ms Zaki's left eye that it closed and she could not see out of it. The offender did not think that he was responsible. Instead, he blamed Ms Zaki, saying , ""See what you have made me do to you. You have made me do this to you."" He then grabbed her hair and pulled her head back. He placed his hands around her throat and started choking her, and began violently twisting her head from side to side. Not surprisingly, Ms Zaki thought she was going to die. It would appear that it is the offender's actions in violently twisting Ms Zaki's head from side to side that caused the subdural haematoma, later identified by doctors when Ms Zaki was taken to hospital. 

15The offender stopped what he was doing and went and played with his children. Ms Zaki had had enough, not surprisingly, and she called the police. Police came to the premises and saw the terrible injuries that she had suffered. While the police were there, the offender said to his wife, in Arabic, that he had nothing else to live for except to come back and kill her. 

16I mentioned before that photographs showed the extent of external injuries suffered by Ms Zaki, but of course there were internal injuries as well. The statement of facts accurately summarises the injuries that were observed by medical staff. She was treated for the following injuries: 

17An acute subdural haemorrhage. The evidence would suggest that a subdural haemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening event, which has a seventy-five per cent chance of causing death when it is acute, and a significant likelihood of some neuronal damage. There is no evidence to suggest that Ms Zaki has suffered any consequences from the subdural haemorrhage. I gather that she is extremely lucky. 

18Doctors also found a left front scalp haematoma which was consistent with the site of some external bruising. There was a boggy swelling to the occipital region of her head. During the course of submissions there was some discussion as to whether that amounted to a fracture to the bones of Ms Zaki's head, but I will sentence him on the basis that what was referred to as a boggy swelling is, in this case, a large area of bruising with no underlying fracture. 

19She also had generalised bruising to her face, forehead, left eye and chin. She had a large bruise over her right posterior chest wall, with fractured right lower ribs. Her sternum was tender. There was blood in her urine which revealed the small liver laceration I referred to earlier. Her upper and lower limbs demonstrated extensive large bruises of various shades, meaning that they were of various ages. In particular, there were large purple bruises covering her right arm and right hand. There was bruising to her left forearm and to both surfaces of her left hand. There was extensive large bruising over her right thigh, a large bruise on her left thigh, as well as multiple patchy bruising over the remainder of both her legs. There was bruising to her right shoulder. In fact, her injuries were so bad that she could not even chew food, and for a while was only able to take in fluids. It appears that, physically, Ms Zaki has recovered with no lasting consequences. 

20The offender was taken to Bankstown Police Station where he admitted hitting his wife over the past two weeks. He told police that she told him to hit her and kill her. He said , ""She upset me so I hit her."" It is difficult to convey in words the extensive nature of the injuries suffered by Ms Zaki, but I have done my best. 

21The offender was born in Egypt. As I mentioned, he married his wife whilst in that country, and they came to Australia in 2005. They have three children. The offender has no other matters on his criminal history. Growing up in Egypt with two brothers, the offender was subject to violence at the hands of his father, who was a soldier and who, the offender said, was very strict. His father would get angry and then hit him and yell at him. The offender told the psychologist that this led him to becoming reclusive and introverted, with things getting worse when he was at school. His interactions with other children appear to have been infrequent, and, when they did occur, they were to the offender's detriment. He was bullied at school and, not surprisingly, had feelings of isolation. He said that he had always lived with feelings of depression. 

22At a very young age he began exhibiting symptoms of psychosis. At twelve or thirteen he began to hear voices and hallucinate. He was treated with monthly injections and daily tablets, which helped him to some extent, but made him lethargic and sleepy. The voices and hallucinations decreased a little bit, but I gather they never went away completely. His father wanted the medication to stop. And so, after a few years, he went untreated. 

23It seems that his mother was psychiatrically unwell also. She would go for regular ECT therapy. In 1996 and 1997 he, once again, began being medicated for his psychiatric conditions. His hallucinations decreased, but once more he stopped being medicated, this time in 1998. He met his wife the following year, but did not tell her about his psychiatric history. 

24Things went downhill in 2008. It was that year that his mother died, and the hallucinations and voices increased. He began to believe that his mother was talking to him and that he could see her moving around in the house. He began drinking for the first time. The voices began to become specific, telling him that his wife had been unfaithful to him, and telling him that he should hit her. It think it was around this time that a supervisor at work approached him and told him that he was making many mistakes, and that if he made another one he would be sacked. This led to him crying for about three hours, which led to the supervisor softening his approach somewhat, but the offender remained scared about job security and how he would provide for his family if he lost his job. 

25Despite the fact that he was being told by voices to hit his wife, he knew that it was wrong. In evidence he said that he was sorry that he did things to her and accepts that the marriage is over. 

26Ordinarily, conduct of this kind would result in the offender spending a very lengthy time in prison. The community is rightfully concerned about domestic violence offences, which go undetected to a large extent. Ordinarily, there would be a need for a sentence containing a substantial component of general deterrence to be imposed upon the offender. Because of the offender's significant mental health problems, which he was suffering from at the time of the offence and which contributed to the offence, he is an inappropriate person to use as a vehicle for general deterrence. 

27On the other hand, it is undeniable that personal deterrence remains an important aspect of the sentence that I shall ultimately impose upon the offender. As Gleeson CJ, pointed out, personal deterrence can become even more important because of a mental illness, at the same time as general deterrence becomes less important. The offender's knowledge that he was doing things that were wrong is a recognition by him of the wrongfulness of his conduct, despite the fact that he was being told by voices to do what he did. 

28Of course, the offences are all serious examples of their type. I note that the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm carried with it a standard non-parole period of four years, which I will take into account. I am not going to impose the standard non-parole period for reasons which appear throughout these remarks on sentence. 

29One matter which was the subject of some evidence this morning, concerned the question of whether this sustained period of violence was the only time during the marriage that there had been violence on the part of the offender. The Crown tendered a statement by Ms Zaki which referred to other acts of violence, but the offender gave sworn evidence denying that he had ever hit his wife before. The Crown did not suggest to him that he was not telling the truth. I will, therefore, sentence him on the basis that the only time he was physically violent to his wife was in October 2009, and that these offences were isolated in that sense. On the other hand, given that this was a sustained period of violence, during which the offender continued beating his wife, even though the injuries that she had already suffered must have been clear to him,  each individual offence is far from isolated. 

30In assessing the seriousness of the offences, of course I take into account many matters, including the injuries caused, the consequences for Ms Zaki, and, it was eventually conceded, the fact that, statistically, there was a significant risk that Ms Zaki might have died. Other matters pointing to the seriousness of the offences concern the length of time over which each individual beating occurred, and the fact that they were all part of a lengthy period of violence. 

31I might at this stage refer to one submission made by the Crown. He suggested that because there were no other acts of violence in the marriage, then these offences were worse because Ms Zaki was mentally unprepared for what occurred in October 2009. At the time he made that submission, I accused him of making a ""Crown prosecutor's submission"", because I am sure that in another case, perhaps with another Crown prosecutor, where there was sustained violence on other occasions, I would receive the submission that it was aggravated for precisely that circumstance. I am not going to accept the Crown's submission. This would have been worse if there had been other acts of violence before October 2009. The mental harm to Ms Zaki, I am sure, would have been greater if that had happened. 

32Most sentencing exercise are difficult, but cases such as this are more difficult than most. We have terribly serious crimes committed by a man who is less able to control his actions than someone who does not suffer from the mental illness affecting him. On the one hand, objectively, a very lengthy sentence of imprisonment is required. But that has to be weighed against the fact that Mr Matar is significantly psychiatrically unwell, and that treatment for his psychiatric problems would at least reduce the risk of further offending in the future. 

33The plea of guilty was entered after the matter had been listed for trial, but not, I gather, on the day the trial was due to commence. No-one has made any reference to any formal case conferencing which would mandate the discount for sentence that I will allow for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. In those circumstances, I will reduce the sentences I would otherwise impose by about fifteen per cent, to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. I will also make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. It is perhaps more modest than most findings of special circumstances, but I have chosen the appropriate non-parole period as the least that is appropriate for the circumstances of this case. 

34It is clear that there needs to be some accumulation of sentence. Although most of the offences of assault occasion actual bodily harm are to be taken into account when I impose sentence for the most serious offence on the indictment, it should not be thought that the first offence can, effectively, be overlooked. There needs to be some measure of accumulation. 

35For count 1 on the indictment, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of eighteen months to date from 17 October 2009. For count 3 on the indictment, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years, to date from 17 October 2010, and a head sentence of four years. That means that the overall sentence is one consisting of a non-parole period of three years and a head sentence of five years. The non-parole period thus expires on 16 October 2012, which is the first day on which Mr Matar can be released to parole.

		31 January 2012",2011-10-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709086,WO v R [2011] NSWCCA 232,"Judgment  1ALLSOP P :  This is an application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal against conviction and, if leave be granted, an appeal.  We have heard the applicant fully, that is both upon the application to extend time and the appeal, should time be extended.  2The applicant was convicted on 24 May 2007 and sentenced on 16 May 2008 in respect of a number of charges the subject of the appeal.  The charges related to sexual offences against his stepdaughter.  3An undated notice of intention to appeal against conviction and sentence was filed in the registry of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 28 May 2008.  In December 2008 an extension of time for the notice of intention to appeal was granted, expiring on 9 January 2009.  An application for a further extension of time was filed on or about 1 June 2011.  4The written material filed and handed up today gave no explanation of the delay from the expiry of the first extension of time until June this year.  The applicant, however, gave oral evidence today that the delay was due to his inability, through those helping him, to find a particular witness who only responded to an advertisement placed in a newspaper by the applicant's wife in December 2010.  The date of the statutory declaration of the particular witness is 25 January 2011.  5As was evident from the applicant's answers in cross-examination on this evidence, the witness apparently had resided at the same address for over 20 years, being a neighbour of the applicant for a period of time before the trial.  The applicant also said that he has spent years in prison thinking how he could show that his conviction was wrongful, by, in particular, demonstrating that the complainant lied on oath at the trial.  6At the trial not only did the complainant give evidence but so did the applicant.  His evidence was directed to his innocence and was in conflict directly with that of the complainant.  The result of the trial can only reflect that the jury disbelieved the applicant.  The applicant had also asserted at the trial that the police and another stepdaughter gave false evidence.  7The applicant has provided submissions and material which has been marked.  Only some of the material is by way of submission, but the Court was of a view that the totality of the material should be placed on the record.  8The material, as the Crown submissions and summary of the trial demonstrate, and as a reading of it demonstrates, takes issue with a significant body of detail of evidence led at the trial, in particular with alleged inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the evidence led by the Crown and in particular that of the complainant.  9One particular aspect of the matter of these inconsistencies and inaccuracies concerns what I will call the ""walking of the dogs"".  The applicant has focused significant effort on demonstrating an asserted error regarding count 2 by revealing that the complainant's evidence about greyhounds or dogs, in the plural, must be wrong.  This was so because it was said by the applicant that he only had one adult greyhound to walk and that he did not walk it.  10An understanding of the significance of this can be gleaned from the submissions and the material before the Court.  Briefly, however, one offence, count 2, was said to have taken place near an oval while the applicant and the complainant were walking the applicant's dogs.  This was the evidence of the complainant.  The asserted falsity is demonstrated, the applicant says, by the fact that he had one adult dog and that he never walked it.  11The person who has come forward and sworn a statutory declaration is response to the advertising says in that document that the applicant and his wife had one race dog and a pup, and that to the best of his knowledge the eldest daughter or the son would walk the dog.  This person, the neighbour, cannot recall, as said in the statutory declaration, seeing the applicant walk the dog.  12As I have said, the other written material minutely dissects aspects of the evidence given in a series of assertions of its falsity insofar as it was either incriminating or inconsistent.  13It should be noted that the trial judge gave clear express directions as to the evidence of the complainant, including upon the inconsistencies that had been pointed out in it by counsel for the defence and also by the Crown.  Having examined the directions in this respect, there does not appear to be any error, and none is otherwise asserted.  14The so-called fresh evidence is from a witness who was available at the time of the trial.  Its content is not to any degree cogent as to exculpation.  At the most it goes to a matter of detail that does not go to the substance of the allegations or the likely credit of the complainant.  The evidence does not prove that the applicant could not have walked the dog with the complainant on that day.  Whether there was one dog or were two dogs is a matter of detail separate from the substance of the allegations.  15In the light of the evidence as to where the witness lived, there is no satisfactory explanation, in my view, for the delay from the expiry of the first extension of time to June 2011.  16As to extension of time reference can be made to R v Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199, R v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 and Arja v R [2010] NSWCCA 190.  It suffices to say that if material had been brought forward that gave a reasonable prospect of success on appeal, the court would always be loath in the interests of justice to shut out an offender from pursuing an appeal, even though late.  Of course, circumstances as to delay vary infinitely and each case must be assessed on its merits.  17Here, however, I am of the view that the material filed and upon which the applicant relies does not demonstrate any reasonable basis to think that the appeal would be other than hopeless.  18For these reasons, I would refuse the application to extend further the time to file a notice of appeal.  19ROTHMAN J :  I agree with the President.  20BARR AJ :  I also agree.  21ALLSOP P :  The orders of the court are therefore that the application to extend further the time to file the notice of appeal be dismissed.  **********

2709098,R v Ronald SHIELS [2011] NSWSC 1177,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE  1On 29 August 2011 I found the offender, Ronald Shiels, guilty of the murder of his father Trevor Shiels.  At the time of the deceased's death he was just turning 42 years old and the offender was not quite 21 years old.  They had generally got on well together over the years.  The two used to do things together.  They spent some time working on a motor vehicle and both derived enjoyment from each other's company in that endeavour.  The deceased was a big man, a driver, 1.75 metres tall and weighing 84 kilograms.  The offender is of slight build.  2When he was about 15 years old, the offender began to use cannabis, and from then he used it regularly.  During the two years or so before the death of the deceased he began using it heavily.  He drank alcohol from the age of 16 years, taking it weekly until he was drunk.  The deceased used alcohol and drank to excess on occasions.  When he did he became quarrelsome and tended to be violent.  Sometimes he became a bully and occasionally there was violence between him and the offender.  3In August 2007 the offender was charged with assault, threatening violence and causing fear and with having custody of an offensive instrument in a public place.  He was granted the benefit of 12 month bonds.  4His behaviour began to change about two years before the events giving rise to the charge.  He fell into a pattern of repetitive speech and appeared on occasions not to understand what he was being told.  What he said sometimes made no sense.  He stopped looking after his appearance. He continued to use cannabis heavily and to drink regularly to drunkenness.  5He had a girlfriend and they lived together at his parents' house.  In April 2008 she gave birth to a child.  6In December 2008 an incident took place after the offender had been out with his sister.  When they returned home his sister had a sore eye, not the fault of the offender.  The deceased, who had been drinking, jumped to the conclusion that the offender had assaulted her, remonstrated with him and seized him by the throat.  A struggle followed and the offender picked up a shovel and dealt the deceased a blow on the arm, leaving a wound that had to be attended to in hospital.  The offender had been hearing voices for about two months before that event.  He also thought that his girlfriend was having an affair with the deceased, though he was also aware that that was all in his imagination.  He told the deceased that something was wrong and asked him to take him to Mental Health.  Nothing happened.  The offender was convicted of the reckless wounding of the deceased and was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, suspended on his entering into a bond for 18 months.  7Eventually the voices stopped.  In 2009 the offender increased his use of alcohol.  His parents lost their home and one consequence was that the offender and his girlfriend had to separate.  He was distressed about that.  The voices returned, telling him to run under cars or otherwise hurt himself.  He thought that he would lose his girlfriend and had thoughts of suicide.  There was an incident in October 2009 when he attacked the deceased with a length of wood.  His family took him to Campbelltown Hospital.  He was admitted under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2007 as mentally disordered.  He was recorded as being hostile and angry and believing that his girlfriend was cheating on him and that his daughter was not his, although he had no evidence of it.  He wanted to hurt himself or others.  He was insightless and wanted to break out of hospital.  A psychiatrist concluded that he was acutely psychotic and required treatment in hospital for his own safety and that of others.  8The accused gave a history of cannabis use, commencing at 15 years of age.  That would have been in 2004.  More recently that had become a daily habit and he was smoking 10 to 20 cones a day.  He reported binge alcohol use in the order of 12 or more standard drinks at a time.  He was commenced on the anti-psychotic drug Olanzapine.  By 27 October he had substantially improved and was acknowledging that he might be suffering from a mental illness.  He agreed to counselling for alcohol and cannabis abuse.   He no longer had suicidal or homicidal thoughts and no longer believed that his girlfriend had been unfaithful.  Following periods of escorted leave without incident he was discharged on 4 November 2009.  His medication was then Olanzapine 7.5 mg mornings and 10 mg nightly.  He did not believe that he needed to take the drug but agreed to do so.  At the time of discharge there was no evidence of persisting psychotic symptoms.  9When he was discharged he went to live with his family and his girlfriend and the child began living there as well.  10He was referred for follow up to the Youth Mental Health Team in Campbelltown.  A case manager was appointed.  He was reviewed by the Psychiatry Registrar once and failed to attend a subsequent planned appointment.  He had several telephone and face to face contacts with the case manager and there were a number of documented occasions when he was unable to be contacted.  On each occasion of review he was noted to be symptom-free and to be supported by his family.  11The offender and his girlfriend had difficulties in managing their own lives and the child and after about two months together in his parents' house they separated.  The separation was on good terms and had nothing to do with the offender's state of health.  12Not long after that, the offender stopped taking the Olanzapine which had been prescribed for him on his discharge from Campbelltown Hospital.  He did so because the voices had stopped and he thought that he was better.  He used cannabis again.  Something he said to his girlfriend on the telephone and the way he said it showed that he was again entertaining delusive thoughts of her infidelity.  13On 19 April 2010, however, his girlfriend spoke to him twice on the telephone and thought he sounded well.  On that day a party was being held to celebrate the deceased's 42 nd birthday.  It took place at the house of one of his sons in the Liverpool district.  The deceased, his wife, the offender's mother and their children attended.  So did the partner of the son who was hosting the party.  During the afternoon and evening some of the adults, including the offender, drank a substantial amount of alcohol.  The mood of the party was happy.  The offender played a joke on the deceased by putting superglue in his hair.  When he realised what had happened the deceased became very angry.  He called the offender a fucking dog and a fucking little cunt.  He said that he would kill him.  At one stage, early in the confrontation, the deceased pushed the offender back onto a lounge chair as he tried to get up.  Referring to the incident of December 2008, the deceased said that the offender had put him in hospital last time, but he would put him in hospital this, or perhaps next, time.  The offender responded by asking the deceased whether he had wanted to have a go and said that he should have killed him with the shovel.  The deceased told the offender that he would not take him back home and that he would have to go and live with his girlfriend.  He twice invited him to go outside the house and fight with fists.  Those angry words went on for a long time.  They must have lasted for at least half an hour and may have lasted longer.  The deceased's anger continued or was revived as he repeated his invitation to fight.  The invitations offered by the deceased and the offender were not taken up and there was no fighting.  About five minutes before he did the act that caused the death of the deceased, the offender sent a text message by mobile telephone to his girlfriend.  The message was as follows:  "" Im goin to kill me dad i put supa glue in his hair lol and im fightin wif him c wat happenz ""  14The offender committed the offence as the deceased was standing as one of a group of people.  The offender went to the kitchen which was close by, took a carving knife, rushed towards the deceased and put the knife into his temple.  The brother whose house it was tried to stop him but sadly was unable to do so.  The deceased took a couple of steps back and raised his arms to protect himself, but to no avail.  The resulting injury to his brain led to his death a few hours later.  15The adults at the house were preoccupied with caring for the deceased, who had collapsed.  They telephoned the emergency number to ask for an ambulance and obeyed the directions of the officer in caring for the deceased.  While that was happening the offender was left to his own devices, but he did not run away.  He went to a neighbour's house and telephoned his girlfriend.  When the police arrived, he approached them and told them that he was the one that they were looking for, that he had stabbed his father.  16A few hours later the offender took part in a recorded interview at the police station and made a full confession about taking the knife and stabbing his father.  He was plainly very upset at what he had done.  Ever since then he has continued to acknowledge his act and has shown strong and clear signs of remorse.  17That was his attitude at trial.  On his arraignment he repeated the plea he had previously made in this Court by pleading not guilty of the murder of the deceased but guilty of his manslaughter.  The offender's case at trial was put principally on the basis of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.  There was psychiatric evidence which supported the offender but that evidence did not ultimately prevail.  The offender by his counsel also raised excessive self defence and provocation.  18I accept that on the evening of the party the offender was suffering from schizophrenia and that he was slipping back towards the condition he had been in during the previous October.  However, the evidence shows that he had no overt signs of psychosis.  I am satisfied that his capacity to understand events or to judge the rightness or wrongness of his actions or to control himself was not substantially impaired by his underlying condition.  19I am satisfied that the offender stabbed his father, intending to kill him, when he lost his temper in the face of the continuing harangue and disinhibited by the alcohol he had consumed.  He did not take the knife to the house but seized it as the opportunity presented itself.  Although the intent to kill was formed a few minutes before the commission of the act causing death, it would not be appropriate to regard the offence as having been planned.  It was committed in hot blood in the face of the deceased's strongly provocative verbal attack.  20At the time of the offence the offender was still subject to the bond  imposed for recklessly wounding his father, and that might at first be thought to aggravate his criminality.  I shall not give it weight, however, because the offender committed the wounding while he was affected by his illness and because the provocative behaviour of the deceased played some part in the events that led to his death.  21There are several mitigating features.  The offender is young.  He is not without a criminal record but it is not a bad one.  His case at trial was conducted on a reasonable basis, given the evidence available to him, and his plea of not guilty of the murder raised no doubt about his genuine remorse.  His family support him strongly.  They were present throughout his trial and I accept that they will continue to support him.  22The offender has been placed on an indefinite regime of anti-psychotic drugs and will need to conform closely with it so that his symptoms do not re-emerge and bring with them the risk of his re-offending.  So far he has complied.  There is no suggestion that he has misbehaved since his arrest.  23Given the support the offender will continue to receive, therefore, there seem to be reasonable prospects that he will not re-offend.  I think that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.  The special nature of his problem, however, will make it necessary for him to have an extended period of time on parole, and I shall impose a sentence which is biased towards parole.  24At present the offender has to spend more time than normal confined to his cell because of his illness.  How long that state of affairs will continue is unclear - a report requested from Justice Health did not materialise and it was inappropriate to delay sentencing any longer - but I assume that as his condition settles he will be able to participate in the ordinary range of programmes available to rehabilitating inmates.  However, his illness is a serious one and to all intents and purposes incurable, so the sentence I will impose will reflect in some way the special difficulty he may have in serving his sentence.  25To a large extent the offender has punished himself.  He has lost a father who at one time was his good friend and companion.  I think that the anguish his act has caused him will continue.  I take those matters into account as well.  26Notwithstanding the intent to kill and the nature of the attack, I think that the offence falls well below the mid-range of objective seriousness of offences of its type.  I have already stated some of the reasons for this conclusion, but I have particularly in mind that the offender was sorely and repeatedly provoked before, disinhibited by the alcohol he had drunk, he finally lost his temper.  That provocation was insufficient to justify a reduction of his verdict to one of guilty not of murder but of manslaughter, but it did significantly mitigate his criminality.  Some regard must therefore be had to the range of sentences generally imposed for manslaughter.  27Ronald Shiels, I sentence you to imprisonment for the murder of Trevor Shiels.  I set a non-parole period of 13 years which will be taken to have commenced on 20 April 2010 and which will expire on 19 April 2023.  The balance of the term of your sentence will be 7 years, expiring on 19 April 2030.  The first day on which you will become eligible for release to parole will be 19 April 2023.  **********

		07 October 2011",2011-10-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2709104,Daniel Clayton Scott v R [2011] NSWCCA 221,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: I agree for the reasons expressed by James J that leave to appeal against sentence should be granted to the applicant but the appeal be dismissed. 

2JAMES J: Daniel Clayton Scott applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the Supreme Court by Hidden J for two offences to which he had pleaded guilty. For an offence of being an accessory before the fact to an offence of aggravated assault with intent to rob while armed with a dangerous weapon the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of five years commencing on 17 June 2008. For an offence of being an accessory before the fact to manslaughter the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 11 years, consisting of a non-parole period of eight years commencing on 17 June 2009 and a balance of the term of three years. The overall sentence was, accordingly, head sentences totalling 12 years and a fixed term and a non-parole period totalling nine years. 

3The trial of the applicant had been fixed to commence before Hidden J and a jury on charges which included a charge of being an accessory before the fact to murder. However, after discussions between the Crown and the applicant's legal representatives, the applicant entered the pleas of guilty to which I have already referred and the Crown accepted those pleas in full discharge of the indictment. 

4Manslaughter is an offence under ss 18 and 24 of the Crimes Act , for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. Assault with intent to rob being armed with a dangerous weapon is an offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period for either offence. Under s 346 of the Crimes Act every accessory before the fact to a serious indictable offence, that is an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of five years or more, is liable to the same punishment to which he would have been liable had be been the principal offender. 

5A statement of agreed facts was prepared for the sentencing of the applicant and in his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge summarised this statement. On this application no complaint was made about any part of his Honour's summary of the statement of agreed facts and the following statement of the facts of the offences is based on his Honour's summary. As his Honour noted in his remarks on sentence, the facts were quite extraordinary. 

The Facts of the Offences 

6The offender's father was a longstanding friend of the victim of the offences, a man named Elliot. 

7In 1997 the applicant's father and Mr Elliot decided to open and conduct a brothel. Before the brothel actually opened, the applicant's father died and the applicant inherited his father's share in the business venture. 

8After a time the relationship between the applicant and Mr Elliot deteriorated and it was agreed between them that Mr Elliot would sell his share in the business to the applicant. The applicant had no ready funds and he provided the consideration for the transfer to him of Mr Elliot's share in the business by transferring to Mr Elliot his family home, which had been built by his father. The applicant deeply resented Mr Elliot taking his house. 

9In February 2000 Mr Elliot began the construction of a new brothel about 300 metres away from the existing brothel. This angered the applicant, as it was his understanding that there was an agreement between himself and Mr Elliot that Mr Elliot would not open any brothel in competition with the existing brothel. 

10The two principal offenders in the offences for which the applicant was sentenced as being an accessory before the fact were two men named Utz and Grupe. Both Utz and Grupe had been in the Australian army and the applicant had met Utz while serving in the Army Reserve. The applicant knew that Utz was a gun enthusiast and he had been told that Utz and a friend of Utz were available ""to bash or fix up someone"". 

11The applicant told Utz of his grievances against Mr Elliot. Utz became aware that Mr Elliot regularly carried a significant amount of cash and was likely to have a large amount of cash concealed in his house. 

12In April or May 2000 the applicant asked Utz to intimidate and harm Mr Elliot. It was agreed by the applicant and Utz that Utz would confront Mr Elliot and cause Mr Elliot some physical harm, in the hope that this would make Mr Elliot conduct his new business more fairly to the applicant. It was also agreed that Utz would rob Mr Elliot of his money, for Utz's own benefit. Utz recruited Grupe to participate in the carrying out of the agreement. 

13In May 2000 Utz and Grupe formed a plan to intercept Mr Elliot at his brothel, force him into a vehicle and drive him to his home and there compel Mr Elliot at gunpoint to disclose where his money was hidden. 

14Two days before Mr Elliot's death the applicant, Utz and Grupe met at a hotel. The applicant showed Utz and Grupe a photograph of Mr Elliot and provided a plan of the house. The applicant provided Utz with a pistol but did not provide any ammunition for the pistol. The applicant said that, as he would come under suspicion, he would arrange an alibi. 

15Utz and Grupe were in possession of a number of firearms and a patrol vehicle, which they had stolen some months previously from an army establishment. 

16On 26 May 2000, the day on which the offences were committed, Utz and Grupe drove the patrol vehicle to where Mr Elliot's new brothel was under construction. Each of them was armed with an automatic weapon and ammunition. They also had the pistol which the applicant had given them. It was loaded and equipped with a silencer. Both Utz and Grupe were wearing balaclavas. 

17When Mr Elliot appeared there was a physical struggle between Utz and Mr Elliot, in the course of which Mr Elliot succeeded in removing the balaclava Utz was wearing. Mr Elliot tried to escape. Grupe fired a round or ""burst"" to stop Mr Elliot escaping, thereby wounding Mr Elliott. Utz then shot Mr Elliot while he was lying on the ground. Ballistics evidence showed that 15 rounds of ammunition were fired into Mr Elliot's body while he was lying on the ground. The pistol which the applicant had provided was also fired, ten fired cartridge cases being found. After they had shot Mr Elliot Utz and Grupe drove away from the scene. 

18Towards the end of the year 2000 Utz contacted the applicant and demanded that the applicant pay money to him. Utz threatened the applicant that, if he did not pay or if he revealed what had happened to the police or anyone else, the applicant, his wife and his children would be killed. The applicant agreed to pay $50,000 to Utz and Grupe and did so by three instalments in early 2001. 

19In March 2002 Grupe killed Utz during a violent altercation between them. Grupe was tried for murder in Queensland but was acquitted on the basis of self-defence. 

20While Grupe was in custody awaiting trial for the homicide of Utz, he was interviewed by New South Wales police about the killing of Mr Elliot. Much of the statement of agreed facts and hence the sentencing judge's summary and my further summary is derived from what Grupe told police. 

21Grupe pleaded guilty to the murder of Mr Elliot and was sentenced to imprisonment for 19 1/2 years with a non-parole period of 14 1/2 years. He received a substantial discount for his plea of guilty and the assistance he had provided. 

22The sentencing judge made findings that the applicant knew that Utz and Grupe might have other firearms (that is firearms other than the pistol) and that these other firearms might be loaded. 

23In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge summarised the basis on which the applicant was being sentenced for manslaughter as follows: - 

""The offender stands for manslaughter on the basis that a reasonable person in his position, planning this enterprise to harm and intimidate Mr Elliot, would have realised that he was exposing him to an appreciable risk of serious injury. He did not intend, nor did he anticipate, that Mr Elliot would be shot at, let alone killed."" 

24With respect to the offence of manslaughter, the sentencing judge said in paragraph 39 of his remarks: - 

""The manslaughter is clearly in the more serious category of offences of that kind. The offender was the instigator of an enterprise which was both unlawful and highly dangerous. As I have said, he knew there was a risk that Utz and Grupe might carry loaded firearms. While he did not anticipate that Mr Elliot would be deliberately shot, he must have been aware of the possibility of the involuntary discharge of a gun in the course of a violent incident. Obviously, Utz and Grupe were experienced in the use of firearms but that eventuality could not be ruled out."" 

25With respect to the offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, his Honour noted that the offence (like the manslaughter offence) was aggravated by being committed in company and was aggravated because the robbery was to be perpetrated in the victim's home. 

26The sentencing judge found that the criminal venture was conceived primarily, although not wholly, for financial gain. The applicant had been motivated by his desire to protect his business interests from competition from Mr Elliot and by his animosity towards Mr Elliot. Financial gain was the motive for the planned robbery, although the applicant was not himself to receive any part of the proceeds. 

Subjective Features 

27In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge noted some of the subjective features of the applicant. 

28The applicant had left school early. He completed a carpentry apprenticeship and worked in his father's building business. This had been his only work experience until, after his father's death, he found himself the joint proprietor of a brothel. 

29The applicant had separated from his wife by whom he had had two children in 1999 and had entered into a relationship with another woman, which the sentencing judge found to be stable. 

30The applicant had no criminal history and no history of aggressive behaviour. The sentencing judge agreed with an opinion of a psychologist who had interviewed the applicant that the applicant's expectation that, if everything had gone according to plan, Mr Elliot would not have pursued the development of his competing brothel as ""naive and short sighted"". The psychologist did not detect any sign of mental illness. 

31The sentencing judge found that the applicant had been a well-behaved prisoner, who had taken up the rehabilitative opportunities available to him within the Correctional system. The sentencing judge found that the applicant was remorseful and had insight into the seriousness of his offence. The sentencing judge found that the applicant's pleas of guilty were late pleas but should be allowed a discount of 15 per cent for their utilitarian value. 

The Reasoning of the Sentencing Judge 

32The sentencing judge rejected a submission by the Crown that there should be proportionality between the sentences to be imposed on the applicant for the offence of manslaughter and the sentence which had been imposed on Grupe for the murder of Mr Elliot. His Honour reasoned that, although Grupe had been sentenced for his part in the same criminal episode, the offence for which he had been sentenced had been much more serious and his criminality had been of a different order from that of the applicant. 

33The sentencing judge noted that the sentences to be imposed would have to give effect to the sentencing purposes of retribution and deterrence (as well as the other purposes of sentencing). General deterrence was more important than specific deterrence. 

34The sentencing judge found in favour of the applicant that he was a person of previous good character who had committed serious offences in unusual circumstances but who retained support in the community and was unlikely to re-offend. The sentencing judge noted that he had been referred by counsel for the applicant to some single judge sentencing decisions. However, his Honour considered that little assistance would be gained from these cases. It will be necessary to make further reference to this part of his Honour's remarks on sentence in considering one of the applicant's grounds of appeal against sentence. 

35The sentencing judge explained in his remarks on sentence that, but for the pleas of guilty, he would have imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of six years for the offence of armed assault with intent to rob, that he would allow a discount of 15 per cent for the plea of guilty and would round off the resulting figure to five years. His Honour said that, but for the plea of guilty, he would have imposed a sentence of 13 years for the offence of manslaughter, that he would allow a discount of 15 per cent for the plea of guilty and would round off the resulting figure to 11 years. His Honour said that he would fix a non-parole period slightly below the statutory proportion in sentencing the applicant for the offence of manslaughter, so as to preserve the statutory proportion in the aggregate sentence. 

36The applicant relied on two grounds of appeal against sentence, namely: - 

1. The sentencing judge erred in failing to sentence the applicant in accordance with sentencing patterns that were prevalent at the time of the offence. 

2. The sentencing judge erred in failing to make the sentence in relation to the assault with intent to rob wholly concurrent with the sentence in relation to the manslaughter count. 

I will consider these grounds of appeal in turn. 

1. The sentencing judge erred in failing to sentence the applicant in accordance with sentencing patterns that were prevalent at the time of the offence. 

37It was apparent from the submissions of counsel for the applicant in support of this ground that the ground was directed to the sentence for the offence of manslaughter (being an accessory before the fact to manslaughter). 

Submissions for the applicant 

38The steps in the submissions of counsel for the applicant can be summarised as follows. 

39There had been a delay in the sentencing of the applicant. The offence had been committed on 26 May 2000 but the applicant had not been sentenced until 10 September 2010. 

40If there has been a delay in the sentencing of an offender and in the period since the time of the commission of the offence sentencing patterns (sentencing practice) have moved adversely to the offender, then the sentencing court should take into account sentencing patterns for the offence at the time of the commission of the offence. Counsel referred to the leading case of R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368. 

41Since the commission of the offence sentencing patterns in sentencing for manslaughter had moved adversely to the applicant. To make good this submission counsel referred to paragraph 46 of Hidden J's remarks on sentence in the present case and to paragraph 40 of Howie J's remarks on sentence in R v Frazer and Spencer [2007] NSWSC 1449. 

The Crown ' s submissions 

42The principal submissions of counsel for the Crown can be summarised as follows. 

43The Crown accepted that there had been some delay in the sentencing of the applicant and the Crown accepted the principle established by MJR. 

44There are serious practical difficulties in a sentencing court determining what were, a number of years previously, the patterns of sentencing for an offence and these practical difficulties are greater in the case of the offence of manslaughter, where there is a particularly wide range of offending behaviour and it is difficult to discern, even at any one time, any pattern in the sentences being imposed for the offence. 

45Notwithstanding this Court's usual wariness in relying on sentencing statistics, on an enquiry into whether sentencing patterns for an offence have changed the Court can properly refer to statistics of sentences for manslaughter. The Crown referred to a publication of the New South Wales Judicial Commission Sentencing Homicides in New South Wales 1994-2001 as containing statistical information about sentencing patterns for manslaughter at about the time of the present offence and to statistics kept by the Judicial Commission of sentences for manslaughter from April 2003 to March 2010 as containing statistical information about sentencing patterns for manslaughter at about the time the applicant was sentenced. It was submitted that a comparison of the two sets of statistics showed that there had not been any significant increase in sentences for manslaughter. 

46The Crown also referred to sentences in some individual cases as showing that the sentence imposed on the present applicant was consistent with sentencing patterns at the time the offence was committed. 

Decision 

47Although the delay in the present case between the time of the commission of the offence and the time at which the applicant was sentenced was less than the delay in MJR itself and in some cases in which MJR has been applied, there was a delay between the date of the offence and the date of the sentencing for the offence and the Court must have regard to the principle established by MJR . 

48In MJR it was held (by majority) that a sentencing court should take into account sentencing practice at the date of the commission of an offence, when sentencing practice has moved adversely to the offender between the date of the commission of the offence and the date of the sentencing for the offence. In MJR the Court followed its earlier decisions in R v Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37 and R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 and declined to follow its earlier decision in R v PLV (2001) 51 NSWLR 736 . 

49There is likely to be serious practical difficulty in establishing what was the sentencing practice at the time an offence was committed, when the offence was committed a number of years previously. This practical difficulty was adverted to in MJR by Sully J, with whose judgment three of the other four members of the Court agreed, at 383-4 [104] where his Honour said:- 

104 As a practical matter, the approach in R v Shore cannot be implemented, as it seems to me either intelligently or intelligibly, unless it happens, as was fortuitously the fact in R v Shore itself, that there exists an authentic and credible body of statistical material that is capable of putting practical flesh upon the theoretical bones of an approach that entails reconstructing what would have been done twenty or so years previously. In that connection, I am in complete and respectful agreement with what was said by Whealy J and by Smart AJ, respectively, in the passages cited by the Chief Justice (at 370[8] and [9] supra). 

50At 370[8] in his judgment in MJR the Chief Justice said:- 

""The issue has also arisen in this Court in R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at 502[23] where Whealy J applied R v Shore and referred to R v Watson . His Honour also emphasised the difficulty of applying the principle: 

[23] Although the principle stated in Shore is clear, its application in a particular appeal is often a difficult matter. First, there is a need to have a clear picture as to the range of penalties imposed at the earlier point of time. In Shore's case for example, there was an extensive analysis of over twenty cases of importation of drugs (see Schedule, shore at 49). Secondly, the perceived difference between the range of sentences disclosed at the earlier point of time and the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge may reveal a discrepancy. Nevertheless it may be one of not so high a kind that the appellate court should interfere ( Shore at 43)."" 

51At 370[9] in his judgment in MJR the Chief Justice said:- 

9 To similar effect, are the observations of Smart AJ (at 746 [107] in R v PLV where his Honour said: 

""The judge correctly had regard to the position which existed in 1974 when the offence was committed and the applicant's present position. There are practical difficulties in trying to recapture the situation which existed 25 years ago. Reference to the odd decided case may not be helpful in trying to obtain an overall picture. Whilst it is not perhaps the best source, there are judges who have a reasonably good recollection of the practice in the courts and the sentences imposed in the period 1965 to 1980. There are judges who do not have such knowledge. If there is no substantial evidence as to that practice (and the sentences) and the sentencing judge is not aware of them then they obviously cannot be taken into account."" 

52The onus is on an offender who contends that sentencing practice has moved adversely to him since the time of the commission of the offence, to establish what was the sentencing practice at the time of the commission of the offence; Moon per Whealy J at 502[25] and per Howie J at 510[64]. 

53The authorities I have already referred to show that evidentiary materials which can be used to discharge this onus include sentencing statistics, individual sentencing decisions and recollections of judges having knowledge of what was the sentencing practice at the time the offence was committed. 

54As I have already noted, the evidentiary materials relied on by the present applicant were paragraph 46 of Hidden J's remarks on sentence in the present case and paragraph 40 of Howie J' remarks on sentence in R v Frazer and Spencer . 

55In paragraph 46 of his remarks on sentence in the present case Hidden J said:- 

""46 Mr Dalton referred me to three cases of sentence for manslaughter arising from a killing in the course of a criminal enterprise: R v Puta and Ors [2001] NSWSC 225, R v Fraser and Spencer [2007] NSWSC 1449 and R v Jackson [2009] NSWSC 168. The first two cases involved shootings. Puta and Ors was a decision of my own, while the other two cases were decisions of Howie J. It is not necessary to analyse them. I have had regard to them but, obviously, every sentencing exercise turns on its own facts and circumstances and little assistance can be gained from reference to a small number of other cases. It should be said, however, that there has been an increase in sentences for manslaughter in recent years. I would have to acknowledge that the sentences passed in Puta and Ors in 2001 would not accord with contemporary sentencing standards."" 

56In Puta and Others Hidden J on 30 March 2001 had sentenced a number of offenders for a manslaughter committed on 5 April 1998. 

57In R v Frazer and Spencer Howie J on 11 December 2007 sentenced two offenders for a manslaughter committed on 11 January 2005. In paragraph 40 of his remarks on sentence Howie J said:- 

""I believe that the manslaughter here is as serious as it could be save for the fact that the offenders are not professional robbers. By that I mean as serious as an offence of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter can be. As I indicated in the course of submissions, I believe there has been an increase in sentences for manslaughter in more recent times, perhaps not for unlawful and dangerous act manslaughters to the same degree, having regard to the cases presented to me. I find it difficult, having regard to the range of sentences imposed in other somewhat similar cases, to mark sufficiently the distinction between committing an offence of armed robbery in the circumstance of this case and where the same acts are done, but resulting in the death of the householder."" 

58At the time the applicant's offence was committed Hidden J was a judge of the Supreme Court. Howie J, who had been a judge of the District Court and who had also been for a time an acting judge of the Supreme Court, was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court on 11 October 2000. It can be accepted that Hidden J in 2010 and Howie J at the time he sentenced Frazer and Spencer would have had some recollection of some sentences for manslaughter in earlier times. 

59I make the following comments about paragraph 40 of Howie J's remarks. His Honour used tentative language ""I believe"", his Honour thought that any tendency had been less in the case of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act and it is unclear what his Honour meant by ""in more recent times"". 

60As already indicated, the evidentiary materials principally relied on by the Crown were the statistics of sentences for manslaughter between 1994 and 2001 in the Judicial Commission's publication ""Sentencing Homicides in New South Wales 1994-2001"" and the statistics of sentences for manslaughter between April 2003 and March 2010 kept by the Judicial Commission. 

61The statistics for the period 1994-2001 were for 231 offenders. Head sentences varied between 18 months and 20 years. The median head sentence was seven years. Non-parole periods varied between eight months and 14 1/2 years. The median non-parole period was four years three months. Twenty offenders received head sentences of more than ten years. Nine offenders received non-parole periods of eight years or more. 

62Statistics for the period between April 2003 and March 2010, some of which were for 234 offenders and some of which were for only 193 of those offenders, showed that head sentences varied between three years and 20 years, that the median head sentence was seven years six months and that non-parole periods varied between 12 months and 16 years, the median non-parole period being three years six months. 

63It seems to me that the comparative statistics, whilst suggesting that there may have been some upward trend in the lowest sentences for manslaughter, do not establish that sentencing practice has moved adversely to offenders for more serious offences of manslaughter. 

64The Crown also relied on some sentencing decisions made at about the time of the commission of the applicant's offence. In R v Nikau [1999] NSWCCA 322 the Court of Criminal Appeal by majority dismissed a prisoner's appeal against a sentence passed on 30 October 1998 for an offence of manslaughter committed on 28 November 1995, being a head sentence of 12 years with a minimum of eight years. In R v Marsh [2001] NSWSC 1109 McClellan J, as his Honour then was, on 29 November 2001 imposed a sentence of ten years four months with a non-parole period of seven years nine months for an offence of manslaughter committed on 3-4 August 2000. In R v Clissold [2002] NSWCCA 356 the Court of Criminal Appeal on 19 August 2002 dismissed a Crown appeal against a sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of eight years for an offence of manslaughter committed on 4 August 1999. Clissold had this similarity to this present case that the offender was sentenced on the basis of having been an accessory before the fact to manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. 

65In my opinion, these three decisions are only of very limited assistance. The facts of each of the cases were very different from the facts of the present case and tend to confirm the truism that the facts of offences of manslaughter vary widely. 

66Howie J in his judgment in Moon , with which Fitzgerald JA agreed, observed at 510 [65] that, if sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offender since the time of the offending, this will probably be a reflection of changes in the attitude of the legislature to the type of offending, evidenced by legislative changes in the nature of the offence or offences and increases in the maximum penalty for the offence or offences. Evidence of such changes in the attitude of the legislature can be observed in the case of some offences, such as offences of child sexual assault. However, the offence of manslaughter remained unchanged, with the same maximum penalty, between 2000 and 2010. While standard non-parole periods have been enacted for many offences, with a resulting increase in the level of sentences for some offences, there is no standard non-parole period for manslaughter. 

67On the whole of the evidentiary materials placed before the Court on this application and particularly the statistical evidence adduced by the Crown, I am not satisfied that it has been established that there was any change, or at least any significant change, in sentencing practice for the offence of manslaughter between the time of the applicant's offence and the time of the sentencing of the applicant. 

68This conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the first ground of appeal. It would not have been an error for the sentencing judge not to sentence the applicant in accordance with sentencing patterns prevailing at the time of the offence, if it has not been shown that there was any significant difference between sentencing patterns prevailing at the time of the offence and sentencing patterns prevailing at the time of the sentencing. 

69It is, however, necessary to deal with a matter which arose in the course of the hearing of the application and is within the general purview of the first ground of appeal or at least closely related to it. 

70I have already quoted paragraph 46 of the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence. In paragraph 46 his Honour said that little assistance could be gained from three cases to which his Honour had been referred, including his Honour's own sentencing decisions in R v Puta and Ors , because each case turns on its own facts and little can be gained from referring to a small number of other cases. However, his Honour then asserted that there had been an increase in sentences for manslaughter and acknowledged that the sentences he had passed in Puta would not accord with contemporary sentencing standards. 

71Earlier, in paragraph 44 of his remarks the sentencing judge had said:- 

""I shall arrive at the appropriate sentence ......... having regard to prevailing standards of sentences for manslaughter"". 

72His Honour did not expressly say whether by ""prevailing standards"" he meant standards prevailing at the time of the sentencing or standards prevailing at the time of the offence. However, if his Honour had meant standards prevailing at the time of the offence, I would have expected him to have expressly said so. 

73It is necessary to exercise caution before concluding that so experienced a criminal judge as his Honour might have misdirected himself but the conclusion I consider I should form is that what his Honour said in paragraphs 44 and 46 of his remarks should be interpreted as conveying that his Honour considered that he should sentence the applicant in accordance with standards of sentencing prevailing at the time of the sentencing and not in accordance with standards of sentencing prevailing in 2001, and that an additional reason for not being able to derive any assistance from the sentences in Puta was that those sentences did not accord with sentencing standards at the time at which his Honour was sentencing the applicant. 

74On this interpretation of his Honour's remarks his Honour did misdirect himself, that he should sentence the applicant in accordance with sentencing standards at the time the applicant was being sentenced and, as a result of this misdirection, his Honour, believing that there had been a change in sentencing standards, might have imposed a heavier sentence on the applicant than he would have done, if he had applied his recollection of sentencing standards at the time of the offence. 

75In these circumstances, I consider that it is necessary for this Court to determine whether it is of the opinion that a less severe sentence than that imposed by his Honour would be warranted; ( Criminal Appeal Act s 6(3)). In making this determination I consider that this Court should proceed on the basis that it has not been established that sentencing practice has moved adversely to the applicant to any significant degree since the time of the offence. 

76I have already referred to the objective facts of the offence and the subjective features of the applicant. I have already quoted paragraph 39 of the sentencing judge's remarks in which his Honour found that the offence was in the more serious category of offences of manslaughter and gave reasons for that finding. 

77In my opinion, this Court should find that no less severe a sentence than that imposed by the sentencing judge would be warranted. 

78I would reject the first ground of appeal against sentence. 

2. The sentencing judge erred in failing to make the sentence in relation to the assault with intent to rob wholly concurrent with the sentence in relation to the manslaughter count. 

79In support of this ground of appeal it was submitted by counsel for the applicant that both the offences for which the applicant was sentenced were ""part and parcel"" of the same plan; that the culpability for the offence of assault with intent to rob being armed with a dangerous weapon was wholly subsumed within the culpability for the manslaughter offence (counsel referred to Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27] per Howie J) and that in making the sentences for the two offences partly concurrent the sentencing judge had infringed the principle that an offender should not be doubly punished for the same conduct (counsel referred to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623). Counsel for the applicant said that the sentencing judge had not given any reasons in his remarks on sentence for making the sentences for the two offences partly cumulative. 

80Counsel for the Crown pointed out that in the proceedings on sentence counsel then appearing for the applicant had accepted that the sentences for the two offences should be partly cumulative and that cumulation to the extent of one year would be appropriate. Accordingly, it was not surprising that there had been no discussion in the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence about whether the sentences for the two offences should be wholly concurrent or partly cumulative. 

81It was submitted by counsel for the Crown that it had been within the sentencing judge's discretion to make the sentences for the two offences cumulative to the extent to which he had. 

82In my opinion, it was open to the sentencing judge to consider that there had been some separate criminality in the offence of assault with intent to rob which was not comprehended within the criminality for the manslaughter offence and hence to make the sentences partly cumulative. 

83Even if there was only one plan, that plan was capable of being dissected into a part of the plan that Mr Elliot should be intimidated and physically harmed and a part of the plan that Mr Elliot should be robbed. The sentencing judge noted in his remarks on sentence that it was an aggravating factor of the offence of assault with intent to rob (but not of the manslaughter offence) that the offence should be committed in the home of the victim where his cash was believed to be hidden. It was not part of the plan for the manslaughter offence that Mr Elliott was to be intimidated and physically harmed in any particular place. 

84I would reject the second ground of appeal. 

Conclusion 

85Having rejected both grounds of appeal against sentence I would, while giving leave to appeal against sentence, dismiss the appeal against sentence. 

86JOHNSON J: I agree with James J.

1WHEALY JA : I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben J. 

2JAMES J : I agree with Hoeben J. 

3HOEBEN J : 
Offences and sentence 
The applicant pleaded guilty before Syme DCJ on 19 April 2010, which was the day fixed for the commencement of his trial. He came before Sorby DCJ for sentence on 13 August 2010 in respect of the following offences: 

Count 1: Aggravated indecent assault of a child under 16 years contrary to s61M(2) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years with a standard non-parole period of 8 years. 

Count 2: Sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 14 years, contrary to s66C(1) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 16 years. 

The Court was asked to take into account on a Form 1 two offences of aggravated indecent assault on a child under 16 years, contrary to s61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. 

4His Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: 

Count 2 - A fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years commencing 20 June 2010 and concluding 19 June 2012. 

Count 1 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 20 June 2011 and conclude on 19 June 2014 with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months to conclude on 19 December 2015. 

The effect of the sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months. 

5The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the severity of the sentence. 

Background to offences 

6On the evening of Friday 9 January 2009 the victim M, who was then aged 12, travelled to the applicant's home in Guildford with his stepfather. The stepfather was staying with the applicant because it was closer to his place of work. That night M slept on a lounge in the kitchen area while his stepfather slept on the floor next to him. 

7By 5am M's stepfather had already left for work leaving M asleep on the lounge. Other occupants of the house were also asleep. The applicant had been consuming alcohol for much of the night up to and beyond 3am. 

8Shortly after 5am, the applicant approached M while he was still on the lounge and began rubbing his legs with his hands. M was wearing shorts at the time. The applicant then sat on a chair opposite M and pushed or kicked one leg towards M's penis and touched M's penis on the outside of his shorts with his shoe. These were the facts relating to the first offence on the Form 1. 

9The applicant then placed his hands on M's shorts and placed his finger in the area of M's anus, which M said hurt. These were the circumstances relating to count 1 on the indictment. 

10The applicant also licked M's face and put his tongue in M's mouth. These facts constituted the second offence on the Form 1. 

11The applicant then produced his penis from his trousers and asked M to suck it. M sucked the applicant's penis approximately two or three times because he was scared. Those were the circumstances relating to count 2 on the indictment. 

12M then told the applicant that he had to go home. He left the applicant's unit, went home and reported straight away to his mother what had happened. His mother called the police. 

13At about 10.30am on 10 January the police attended the applicant's unit, arrested him and conveyed him to Merrylands Police Station where he indicated he wished to be interviewed with an interpreter. During the interview he denied the allegations that M had made, although he did agree that he had massaged M's leg because M had complained of a cramp. 

14The applicant's clothes were taken and subjected to a DNA analysis. The DNA analysis supported the complaints made by M. 

Applicant's subjective case 

15The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. His personal information was contained in reports from Dr Richard Furst, psychiatrist, dated 26 July 2010 and from Dr Susan Pulman, neuropsychologist, dated 27 July 2010. 

16The applicant was born in December 1957 and was aged 52 at the time of sentence. He had not previously been in trouble with the police and this was his first time in prison. He had been on a disability support pension since 1998. 

17The applicant was born in Nicaragua. During his teenage years, the eight-year civil war in Nicaragua was taking place and he saw a number of people killed. He apparently had some mental breakdown at the age of 19 and was hospitalised in Nicaragua for about 12 months. He said that he continued to have intrusive memories of what happened in Nicaragua. He came to Australia with his then de facto partner in 1987. That relationship broke up and at the time of these offences, he was living on his own in a Department of Housing unit at Guildford. He was hospitalised in Australia at Westmead Hospital under the Mental Health Act 1990 in 2005. 

18At the time of the offences, the applicant was a very heavy drinker and would binge drink on weekends. He used cannabis on a regular basis. He had been drinking heavily on the night of the offences. 

19The applicant told Dr Furst that he could not remember the offences. He was shocked when the police told him what had occurred. He said that he had never done anything like that before. He said that he was not attracted to young boys and girls and had not had any previous intention to do anything sexual to the victim. He said that he was completely ""devastated"" after his arrest, had become depressed and stopped eating. He said that he was seen by psychologists and psychiatrists at the Mental Health Screening Unit at the MRRC after his arrest. 

20Dr Furst examined the medical records from Justice Health which confirmed the history given to him by the applicant. Those records indicated that the applicant was depressed and suicidal after his reception into custody. His presentation at that time was described as ""flat in effect, depressed in mood, sleeping poorly and seeing no reason to live"". Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms relating to his conflict experiences in Nicaragua were also noted. 

21The Mental Health Screening Unit noted alcohol and cannabis abuse. There was evidence of auditory hallucinations. He was diagnosed with a psychotic depression that was thought to be related to his alcohol and substance abuse. He was commenced on anti-psychotic medication. 

22Dr Furst diagnosed the applicant as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. He found that he was suffering from a major depressive disorder with psychotic features at the time of the offence. He found that he was alcohol dependent and was abusing cannabis. In relation to the relationship between the applicant's mental condition and the offence, Dr Furst said: 

""The applicant claimed to be amnesic for the events in question when first arrested and remains at a loss to explain his actions. The lack of memory for the events in which he sexually assaulted his friend's son raises the possibility that he was so intoxicated as to have suffered some type of alcoholic blackout. However, there is also a possibility that his depression and/or his PTSD led him to disassociate in some manner. There is a further possibility that he is simply denying any knowledge of what happened however he seemed frank in his account of other events when interviewed."" 

23When Dr Pulman examined the applicant her findings were consistent with those of Dr Furst. She found that the applicant's overall level of intellectual functioning fell within the extremely low range, with his results being at the first percentile. She concluded: 

""As LB's level of intellectual functioning falls within the extremely low range (equating with a scale score below 70), he meets criteria for having an intellectual disability. His particular score fell between 50 and 69, indicating a mild level of intellectual disability."" 

Remarks on sentence 

24In relation to objective seriousness, his Honour said: 

""These facts reveal an objectively very serious offence. Both specific as well as general deterrence are important elements in this sentencing exercise. This offence involved grooming of the victim, or repetition of the acts. The acts were spontaneous and not planned. In my view whilst objectively serious, both offences fall below the mid-range objective seriousness for this type of offences but above the bottom of the range for such offences."" 

25His Honour noted the assessments of Drs Pulman and Furst, and in particular the applicant's long history of mental problems. He also noted the applicant's alcohol dependence problems. In that regard, his Honour said: 

""Alcohol consumption might assist in explaining the offender's offending behaviour, but it cannot excuse it."" 

26In relation to remorse, his Honour said: 

""The offender did not give evidence before me and express any remorse for his offending. From the reports tendered he appears to be in a state of denial and at a loss as to how he could have acted in such a manner."" 

27His Honour noted that the applicant had no criminal antecedents and that this would be his first time in prison, other than a short period in 2009 before he was granted bail for these offences. Because of the applicant's plea of guilty, his Honour allowed a 12 percent discount. His Honour noted that the standard non-parole period in respect of count 1 did not apply because of the plea of guilty. 

28His Honour took account of the applicant's mental condition as follows: 

""Both offences as I have said are objectively serious although falling towards the bottom of the range for such offences. Specific deterrence is important. General deterrence is important but because of the mental illness, as defined by Dr Furst, of long standing post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, it is not so important, although it does have some weight. 

There are subjective factors in the offender's favour that must be also weighed up. In particular, his traumatic experiences in his country of Nicaragua in his youth ... Weighing up the objective seriousness of the offending with the subjective factors and the need for deterrence to the extent that I have found and taking into account the two matters on the Form 1, I consider a period of non-parole of 4 years to be appropriate with a further period of 18 months on parole."" 

APPEAL 
The sentences imposed both individually and in total were unduly harsh and severe 

29The applicant submitted that despite his Honour finding that the offence under s61M(2) fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness, the sentence imposed by reference to sentencing statistics showed that the sentence was towards the top of the range for offences of this kind. The applicant submitted that the sentence was inconsistent with his Honour's finding that the level of criminality was below the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

30In respect of the s66C(1) offence, by reference to sentencing statistics he made the same submission. 

31As this Court has said on a number of occasions, sentencing statistics can provide general information in relation to the range of sentences imposed for a particular offence but their use is limited. The sentencing statistics here do not of themselves demonstrate that the sentences imposed, both individually and in total, were unduly harsh and severe. What the applicant had to demonstrate was that the sentences were ""unreasonably or plainly unjust"" ( Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33] which was endorsed in Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16 - 17]). The question for this Court is not whether different or lesser sentences could have been imposed, but whether the sentences imposed fell within the proper exercise of his Honour's discretion. 

32I am not persuaded on the basis of the applicant's reliance upon statistics that ground 1 of the appeal has been made out. 

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account or sufficiently take into account the mental condition of the applicant 

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in his appreciation of how mental disability impacted on sentence 

33The applicant submitted that it was clear from the report of Dr Furst that he was suffering from a mental disorder or disability at the time of the commission of the offences. He submitted that in assessing his culpability and the importance of general and specific deterrence his Honour did not have due regard to that consideration. The applicant submitted that his low level of intellectual functioning and poor impulse control were also relevant to assessing the objective seriousness of the offences and should have been taken into account. 

34I have concluded that his honour did not sufficiently take into account the mental condition of the applicant when imposing sentence. It is true that his Honour found that general deterrence was to be given less weight but otherwise his Honour made no further allowance for what was a twofold problem, i.e. a mental disability and significantly reduced intellectual functioning. 

35The extent to which mental disability can affect the sentencing process was discussed by Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson J and Blanch AJ agreed, in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 where his Honour said: 

""22 In the present case the Crown was prepared to concede that some mitigation was appropriate, on the basis of giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence. However, that is not the only way in which mental illness impinges on the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 

23 To the extent that mental illness explains the offence - as her Honour found to be the position in the present case - then an offender's inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood CJ at CL put it in Henry , supra, at [254]: 

""The community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgment. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing."" 

24 I agree with the observations of Malcolm CJ in Lauritsen at [48]: 

""Mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of the imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence."" 

25 Further, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than it may otherwise have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal put it: 

""Specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such"". ( Csiaras, supra, at [400])."""" 

36Here his Honour made no reference to the relationship between the applicant's mental state and the commission of the offence, i.e. as to whether his mental condition made any contribution to the offence. Moreover, his Honour stressed the importance of specific deterrence without any analysis as to why that was so and if so, how that was to be reconciled with the applicant's mental condition. The finding by Dr Furst that at the time of the offence the applicant was suffering from a major depressive disorder with psychotic features, tended to indicate a clear connection between the applicant's mental condition and the offences. That conclusion makes his Honour's emphasis upon specific deterrence as an important factor in the sentencing process somewhat problematic. This emphasis becomes even more problematic when regard is had to the applicant's age and the fact that he had not committed any similar offence in the past. It is significant that Dr Furst did not find any inclination towards such offending on the part of the applicant. 

37Finally, his honour did not turn his mind to the effect which the applicant's mental condition had on the issue of culpability. An inability to make reasoned or ordered judgments was an important consideration when considering what was an appropriate sentence for this applicant. 

38For the above reasons, it was appropriate on the facts of this case to sentence the applicant more leniently than would be the case with an offender without his disability. The result has been to produce an overall sentence that is arguably excessive. 

Ground 4 - The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant groomed the victim 

39The applicant submitted that it was accepted by the Crown that the offences were unpremeditated, unplanned and opportunistic. No one referred to ""grooming"". The applicant submitted that there was no evidence to support a finding of ""grooming"". The applicant submitted that there had been a denial of procedural fairness by his Honour making a finding to that effect without giving him the opportunity of dealing with it. 

40The Crown accepted that this ground of appeal had been made out. It agreed that all of the offences had occurred during a single episode, with no evidence of any prior association between the applicant and the victim. The Crown agreed that such a finding was not open to his Honour. 

Ground 5 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to make any allowance for intoxication on culpability 

41The applicant submitted that his Honour should have given more weight to his consumption of alcohol than simply saying ""alcohol consumption might assist in explaining the offender's offending behaviour, but it cannot excuse it"". The applicant submitted that the heavy consumption of alcohol was relevant in mitigating the objective criminality in that the conduct was impulsive and unplanned, and explained the context of the offences. 

42Since it was common ground before his Honour that the offences were unplanned and opportunistic, little additional weight could properly be given to the fact of the applicant's heavy intoxication than that which his Honour allowed. In Waters v R [2007] NSWCCA 219 at [38] James J, with whom Giles JA and Hislop J agreed, said: 

""38 The fact that an offender was intoxicated at the time of committing an offence is not of itself a reason for mitigating the sentence which should be imposed on the offender. However, the fact that an offender was intoxicated at the time of committing the offence may be taken into account as mitigating the objective criminality of the offence, insofar as it indicates that the offence was impulsive and unplanned and that the offender's capacity to exercise judgment was impaired. See R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 per Wood CJ at CL at 397-398 (273). In the present case, it is clear that, by reason of his state of intoxication, the applicant's conduct was impulsive and unplanned and his capacity to exercise judgment was seriously impaired."" 

43His Honour clearly took those matters into account in his approach to the applicant's intoxication. This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground 6 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account that because of his mental problems the applicant would find his prison sentence much harsher. 

44The applicant submitted that although his counsel had made submissions to that effect, and although the Crown had conceded that such was the case, his Honour made no reference to this consideration in his remarks on sentence. That being so, the applicant submitted that his Honour must have made no allowance for it. 

45Such a consideration is clearly relevant when sentencing an offender with a mental illness. In R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 Sperling J, with whom Grove and Dowd JJ agreed, when summarizing the ways in which mental illness may be relevant said: 

""35 Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: Tsiaras at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]."" 

46This was a relevant consideration. His Honour's failure to make any reference to it leads me to conclude that the applicant's submission should be upheld and that his Honour failed to take it into account. 

Ground 7 - The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant had no remorse 

47The applicant submitted that it was not open to his Honour to find that he ""did not express any remorse for his offending"" in circumstances where the applicant said that he had no recollection of the acts which constituted the offences. The applicant submitted that such a finding was contrary to the evidence in the report of Dr Furst where the applicant indicated his shock and dismay when told what he had done and where Dr Furst referred to his ""expression of remorse about his actions"". The applicant submitted that his plea of guilty was indicative of and consistent with remorse. Finally, the applicant submitted that his Honour's finding that ""he appears to be in a state of denial and loss as to how he could have acted in such a manner"" was not inconsistent with an expression of remorse on his part. 

48The onus of establishing remorse as a mitigating factor rests on an applicant on the balance of probabilities ( The Queen v Oldbrich (1999 ) 199 CLR 270. The assessment of whether or not an applicant has satisfied this requirement is a finding of fact with which this court would not lightly interfere. Nevertheless, a finding of the absence of remorse on the facts of this case required a somewhat more detailed examination of the evidence than that which was carried out by his Honour. To simply reject the presence of remorse because the applicant did not give evidence in which he expressed remorse did not adequately deal with the evidence which was before him. 

Ground 8 - The sentencing judge erred in making no findings in respect of rehabilitation or re-offending 

49The applicant submitted that his Honour should have made a positive finding that he was unlikely to re-offend based on his past good behaviour and the opinion of Dr Furst as to his prognosis. 

50The evidence concerning rehabilitation was complex and contradictory. The question of the applicant's rehabilitation depended very much upon the treatment of his mental condition. The evidence in relation to that was somewhat equivocal, even though Dr Furst identified what he described as ""a number of strengths"" which the applicant had which led him to give a positive prognosis in relation to the applicant's mental condition. On that state of the evidence, it is clear why his Honour did not express an opinion one way or the other as to the applicant's rehabilitation prospects. This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground 9 - The sentencing judge failed to take into account that the s61M offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court 

51The applicant put his argument in relation to this ground of appeal as follows. There was no dispute that the s61M(2) offence was a Table 1 offence and was to be dealt with in a Local Court unless an election was made for a trial on indictment. If dealt with summarily, the maximum penalty which could be imposed was 2 years imprisonment. The s66C(1) offence could not be dealt with summarily as the victim was under the age of 14 years ( Criminal Procedure Act, Schedule 1, Table 1, clause 1). 

52Since neither party made submissions on this issue, the strong likelihood was that the issue was entirely overlooked by his Honour. In those circumstances, given the comparatively minor nature of the offence (touching the victim's anus outside his shorts in a way which hurt him) his Honour should have taken this into account as a matter favouring a lesser sentence. 

53The relevant principles were set out by Hall J in R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 as follows: 

""15 The written submissions on behalf of the applicant and those also on behalf of the respondent refer to a number of decisions of this Court. For the purposes of this application, they are stated in short form as a series of propositions or principles as follows:- 

(a) The first is that a judge in the District Court is not bound by the jurisdictional limit imposed on the Local Court when dealing with an offence on indictment which was capable of summary disposal, but may have regard to that limit when the case is one which could appropriately have been disposed of in the Local Court: Regina v. Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16]; Regina v. LPY (2002) 136 A. Crim. R. 237 at 240 and Regina v. El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30]. 

(b) Secondly, the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, remains a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing judge: Crombie (supra) at [15]. 

(c) Thirdly, however, the relevant decisions that establish that principle do not go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and the subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Where it appears that that circumstance has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal: Crombie (supra) at [16]. 

(d) Fourthly, the significance of the loss of the chance of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court varies from case to case. In some cases it would contribute to mitigation of sentence. It is a matter to be taken into account, but is not a universal factor for the reduction of sentence: Regina v. Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. 

(e) Fifthly, the failure by a sentencing judge to mention the matter in his or her remarks on sentence and the length of the sentence does not necessarily establish that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the matter. In some circumstances the length of the sentence may not suggest that the matter was overlooked: Regina v. Depoma [2003] NSWCCA 382 at [17]. 

(f) Finally, in circumstances where a sentencing judge has made no reference to the summary disposal argument in his or her remarks on sentence, it is necessary to consider whether that omission is indicative of error. One way of testing that proposition is to consider whether the sentence itself appears manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case - if the factor had been taken into account and given appropriate weight, a substantially lesser sentence was appropriate in the case : El Masri (supra) at [45] per Johnson, J. (with whom Hunt, AJA. and Hulme, J. agreed)."" 
 
54More recently, in Bonwick v R [2010] NSWCCA 177, Davies J made observations to similar effect: 

""43 Whilst it is clear that there is no obligation on the sentencing Judge to regard himself or herself limited by the maximum penalty available in the Local Court, two relevantly important principles emerge from the cases. The first is that the extent of the criminality is an important consideration in having regard to the Local Court penalty: R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at [21]; Regina v Said El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29] and McCullough at [26]. Secondly, where it appears that the matter of the Local Court penalty has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing Judge that may properly justify the grant of leave to appeal: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16]. 

44 In the present case, it is likely that the matter was entirely overlooked by the sentencing Judge because it is accepted that neither counsel drew it to the Judge's attention. Further support for that inference derives from the omission of the sentencing Judge to make any reference to the fact that the offences could have been dealt with by the Local Court and from the length of the sentence imposed for each of the offences. 

45 This failure to refer to the Local Court limitation on sentence amounts to an error justifying the intervention of this Court. This is because, as the highlighted passages in Palmer make clear, the fact that the Local Court could have dealt with the matter is a relevant consideration to be taken into account."" 

55The sentence imposed in relation to the s61M(2) offence substantially exceeded the maximum penalty available in the Local Court. The facts relating to the offence did not make it unsuitable to be dealt with by the Local Court. Accordingly, this was a factor which should have been taken into account by his Honour as a relevant consideration when sentencing for that offence. This ground of appeal has been made out. 

Ground 10 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to identify and take into account Form 1 matters in respect of a specific offence 

56The applicant submitted that the Form 1 matters were taken generally into account in respect of both offences rather than one single offence. 

57That is not how I read his Honour's remarks on sentence. While his Honour made a general reference to the Form 1 matters, he did say at the conclusion of his remarks on sentence: 

""I formally attach the two matters in the Form 1 to the s61M(2) offence."" 

This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground of appeal 11 - the sentencing judge erred in the actual sentences he pronounced 

58The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge declared that his view of the appropriate penalty for the s61M(2) offence was 3 years imprisonment but the sentence which he actually imposed for that offence was imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. 

59This ground of appeal has not been made out. It is clear from the context and the terms in which his Honour expressed himself, that he was referring to the non-parole period when referring to 3 years imprisonment. 

Conclusion 

60As is apparent from the analysis of grounds of appeal 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9 there were errors in his Honour's approach to the sentencing of the applicant. Most particularly, his Honour failed in a significant way to have due regard to the serious mental disability and intellectual incapacity from which the applicant suffered at the time when the offences occurred. I have concluded that a term of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 4 years for a mentally disabled man with no relevant criminal history in respect of this series of offences committed over a short period of time is excessive. This is particularly so in relation to the s61M(2) offence which despite the presence of a standard non-parole period of 8 years as a signpost, constituted an offence well below the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of that kind although as his Honour correctly concluded, not at the very bottom. 

61Once proper regard is had to the contribution of the applicant's mental disability to his offending behaviour and to the effect of the other successful grounds of appeal to which I have referred, it is clear that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried. I have concluded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 

62I propose to reduce the sentence for the s61M(2) offence so as to produce an effective sentence of imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. It follows from the orders which I propose that I have not interfered with his Honour's finding of special circumstances. 

63The orders which I propose are as follows: 

(1) Grant leave to appeal. 

(2) Allow the appeal. 

(3) Quash the sentences imposed by his Honour Sorby DCJ on 13 August 2010. 

(4) In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced as follows: 

Count 2 - A sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years to commence on 20 June 2010 and to conclude on 19 June 2012. 

Count 1 - A term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 20 June 2011 and to conclude on 19 June 2013 with a balance of term of 18 months to date from 20 June 2013 and to conclude on 19 December 2014.

		07 October 2011",2011-10-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709126,Passaris v R [2011] NSWCCA 216,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I have had the privilege of reading the judgments of Hall J and Harrison J in draft. Each of their Honours agrees that leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed. I agree with those orders for the reasons given by Harrison J, subject to what I have said below concerning the operation of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 (""the Act""). 

2As Harrison J has pointed out, the question of whether the sentencing judge erred in failing to give consideration under s 17(4) of the Act, to whether the applicant was entitled to a greater discount in respect of his plea to that provided for in s 17(2), depended in the present case on whether the pre-condition to s 17(5)(b) of the Act was satisfied; namely, whether the compulsory conference certificate recorded an offer by the offender to plead guilty to an alternative offence that was refused by the prosecution before committal for trial, and accepted by the prosecution after committal for trial. 

As Harrison J further pointed out, the compulsory conference certificate, incorrectly stated to be a ""Pre-Conference Disclosure Certificate"", certified that the accused offered to plead guilty to the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in contravention of s 35 of the Crimes Act 1900 , and the Director of Public Prosecutions rejected the offer of the plea of guilty to that offence. 

3It was acknowledged at the sentencing hearing that the facts on which the plea was accepted were different to those on which the plea was offered. The extent of the differences was not disclosed. The Crown essentially contended that for the offer to fall within s 17(5)(b) there must be an identity of facts on which the offer was initially based and those on which the plea was accepted. 

4Hall J is of the view that the offer to plead guilty was not an offer falling within s 17(5)(b) of the Act for two reasons. First, that the requirement in s 12(2) that the compulsory conference certificate be signed by the prosecution and the accused person before it is filed was not complied with, and second, because the applicant's offer to plead guilty to the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in contravention of s 35 of the Crimes Act was not an unequivocal offer because it was only made on the basis that the Crown accept the statement of facts propounded by the applicant. 

5Harrison J, on the other hand, is of the view that the offer was one which fell within the provisions of s 17(5)(b) of the Act. 

6Although I am inclined to agree with Hall J that the requirement in s 12(2) that the compulsory conference certificate be signed by the prosecution and the accused person is a mandatory requirement and essential to the validity of the certificate, I would not base my decision on this ground as the point was apparently not taken before the sentencing judge, nor did this Court receive the benefit of any argument on the matter in the course of the appeal. 

7So far as the second question is concerned, namely whether an offer to plead guilty on the basis of certain facts was an offer to plead guilty within the meaning of s 12(3)(c) of the Act and thus falls within s 17(5)(b) of the Act in circumstances where the ultimate acceptance of the plea is based on different facts to those offered by the appellant, I agree with what has been said by Harrison J substantially for the reasons given by him. However, because of the disagreement between Hall J and Harrison J on this issue it is desirable that I shortly set out my reasons for coming to this conclusion. 

8I was initially attracted to the contention of the Crown that, for an offer to fall within s 17(5)(b), there must be an identity of facts on which the offer was initially based to those on which the plea was accepted. An offer to plead guilty to an offence would, as a matter of common parlance, generally include the terms on which the offer was made. Further, such a construction would avoid a situation that may arise where the offender would get the benefit of an early plea in circumstances where the facts upon which his or her offer was based bore little resemblance to the facts which he or she ultimately accepted as correct. 

9However, on reflection I do not think this construction reflects either the words of the section or the intention manifested by the legislation. 

10Section 6(3) of the Act sets out the purpose of the legislation. It provides as follows: 

""6(3) The purpose of the compulsory conference is to determine whether there is any offence or are any offences to which the accused person is willing to plead guilty and any other matters referred to in section 12(3) on which the accused person and the prosecution are able to reach agreement. "" 

11Section 12(3) sets out a series of matters which are to be disclosed in the compulsory conference certificate. Section 12(3)(e) provides as follows: 

""12(3) The compulsory conference certificate is to certify as to the following matters: 

... 

(e) if the accused person has offered to plead guilty to any offence and the offer has been accepted by the prosecution - details of the agreed facts on the basis of which the accused person has offered to plead guilty and details of facts (if any) in dispute ..."" 

12It follows that the section expressly envisages the circumstances where the plea has been accepted but not solely on the facts on which the offer to plea was based. 

13Thus it appears in circumstances where the factual basis of the plea is not agreed to, the prosecution has two choices; either reject the plea or accept it but record in the certificate that certain facts remain in dispute. If it takes the former course it will not be able to go behind the certificate which will record the offer to plead guilty pursuant to s 12(3)(c). However, it will still be able to argue that notwithstanding the plea, as a matter of discretion no discount greater than that provided in s 17(2) should be allowed. If it accepts the plea but disputes some of the facts, that can be taken into account in determining whether a discount greater than that provided in s 17(2) should be allowed. 

14That construction accords with the literal meaning of the words "" offer by the offender to plead guilty "" , and the intention as manifested by s 6(3) of the Act. It also avoids the difficulties which would otherwise arise in going behind the certificate having regard to the prohibition contained in s 6(4) of the Act against the admission of evidence as to what was said at the conference. 

15The Crown submitted that such a construction would allow a defendant to plead guilty on the basis of facts which would traverse the plea. In my opinion, this submission is not correct. There is no doubt that a plea of guilty must be unequivocal: Maxwell v The Queen [1996] HCA 46; (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 511. That means, in my opinion, that it must be solemn confession of the ingredients of the crime and an admission of all facts essential to the offence: Marlow v R [1990] Tas R 1 at 17; Blazevski v Judges of the District Court of New South Wales (1992) 29 ALD 197 at 208. This does not mean, however, that there cannot be a dispute surrounding the facts regarding the offence, provided the facts admitted by the accused are sufficient to constitute the elements of the offence. As I stated above, so much is recognised by s 12(3). In such a case the approach of the Court is as set out by this Court in R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 as follows: 

"" [21] It behoves the parties, especially after a 'plea bargain', to ensure that the sentencing court is made aware from the outset of the proceedings whether there is any dispute as to the factual basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced and identify with particularity what matters are in issue. Disputed facts are to be resolved by accusatorial process upon evidence before the court, Chow v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 604-608. If a statement of facts is to be tendered, it should both support the charge for which the offender is to be sentenced and accord with the offence charged. It should not contain facts that would aggravate the offence in breach of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. If it purports to be an agreed statement of facts so that it is intended to provide the factual basis upon which the parties wish the court to sentence the offender, the facts should be sufficient to permit the court to exercise its discretion and the Crown should not tender other material which might supplement or contradict the facts set out in the agreed statement. If other material is placed before the court which relates to the facts of the offence, then the parties should understand that the court is not bound by the tendered statement of facts or any agreement made between the parties as to the basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced: Altham (1992) 62 A Crim R 126; Chow v DPP , above at 606. All too frequently, or so it seems to me, uncertainty, confusion and, sometimes, error arises because of the failure of the parties, and in particular the Crown, to clearly identify the material upon which the facts of the matter are to be gleaned by the sentencing court. So it was in the present case."" 
 
16In the event that the offer to plead guilty did not encompass an admission of all the essential elements of the offence, in my opinion, it would not amount to a plea of guilty (see Blazevski v Judges of the District Court , at 212) and the prosecution would be entitled to refuse to sign a certificate which recorded that an offer to plead guilty to a particular offence was made. 

17In the present case the certificate sets out that there was an offer to plead guilty and there is no evidence to suggest that the offer did not encompass an admission of all the essential elements of the offence. 

18In those circumstances, I agree with Harrison J that the earlier plea of guilty made by the applicant did fall within s 17(5)(b) of the Act. 

19I should add that the problem raised by the Act in this case could be overcome relatively simply by amending the legislation to provide that a case conferencing certificate should not only set out a plea of guilty but the essential facts on which the applicant agreed to so plead. This would enable a court in the exercise of its discretion to assess the significance of the difference between the facts originally offered and the facts on which the plea was ultimately based. 

20HALL J : I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J that leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed. 

21I, however, have reached a different conclusion to that expressed by Harrison J in relation to Ground 1(iii) of the grounds of appeal. 

22In relation to Ground 1(iii), it was contended that the sentencing judge had ""Failed to take into account the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 NSW "" (referred to in the judgment as ""the Conferencing Trial Act""). I do not consider that there was any failure by the sentencing judge as alleged as I do not consider on the facts established that those provisions were engaged. 

23Harrison J has conveniently set out the relevant provisions. They include, in particular, s 12 and s 17 of the Act. Those are the key provisions for the purpose of Ground 1(iii). 

24There are three bases upon which I have concluded that no appellable error exists in terms of that ground. I will discuss each in turn. 

Validity of the Compulsory Conference Certificate 

25An examination of the facts as established in evidence before the sentencing judge, in my opinion, leads to the conclusion that the statutory requirements for a Compulsory Conference Certificate were not satisfied. 

26The legislative provisions of the Conferencing Trial Act 2008 establish a statutory process which is to be followed following a compulsory conference held under the provisions of the Act. That process includes a certificate that complies with the provisions of the Act. A ""certificate"", by its ordinary dictionary meaning, means a document that certifies or gives assurance or attests to particular facts. By s 12(1) of the Conferencing Trial Act , the prosecution and a legal representative who acted on the accused person's behalf at the conference ""... must complete a Compulsory Conference Certificate..."". Furthermore, s 12(2) requires that the Compulsory Conference Certificate ""... is to be signed by the prosecution and the accused person before it is filed in accordance with subsection (4)"" (my emphasis). 

27The provisions of both s 12(1) and (2) specify mandatory requirements for a Certificate under s 12. A certificate must be both completed and signed by the prosecution and the accused person (or the legal representative who acted on the accused person's behalf). 

28The parties in the present proceedings put their submissions upon the basis that the document in evidence entitled ""Outcome of Local Court Conference"" was a ""compulsory certificate"" under s 12 of the Act. The document stated that, as a result of the conference held on 14 May 2009, ""... the following is certified..."". There then is set out four paragraphs which purport to address the matters specified in s 12(3). 

29The Certificate, ""Outcome of Local Court Conference"", in the present case was, on the evidence, completed and signed by the prosecution only. The Certificate (p 2) was executed by the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions (referred by name as Shiva Rich) dated 20 May 2009. A copy of the Certificate in evidence before the sentencing judge was not executed, (signed) or dated by the ""Legal Representative for the Accused "". Accordingly, insofar as the document purported to be a Conference Certificate, it accordingly failed to comply with s 12(1) and (2) in that it was not completed or signed as specified. 

30I note that the evidence before the sentencing judge included a copy of a facsimile sent by Shiva Rich on 20 May 2009 on the letterhead of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to the legal representative for the accused. The facsimile, in part, stated: 

""Please find attached a copy of the Case Conference Outcome Form. I will have a copy attached to the file at court tomorrow. Could you please sign the form at court so that it can be filed by the DPP solicitor. If there are any issues, please contact me today to discuss ..."" 

31There is no evidence of any response by the legal representative for the accused to the facsimile. There is no evidence that the legal representative for the applicant ever signed the ""Certificate"" or did anything in relation to completing the document. On that basis, there was no evidence before the sentencing judge of a certification as required by the statute. 

32The terms of the Conferencing Trial Act which specifies detailed requirements for a Compulsory Conference (s 6) the completion and signing of a Compulsory Conference Certificate (s 12), in my opinion, evidence a legislative intention that the above statutory requirements form a fundamental and important part of the conferencing scheme established by the Act. The specificity of the requirements in the Act concerning the conduct and certification of compulsory conferences conducted under it, in my opinion, require strict compliance. There is, as discussed below, good reason for that requirement. 

33Strict compliance with the provisions of s 12 is significant when the operation of s 17, Discount for Guilty Plea is taken into account. The express provisions of s 17(4) and (5) depend, inter alia, for their operation upon the existence of a valid Compulsory Conference Certificate. A complying Conference Certificate may under s 17 form the basis for a finding that ""substantial grounds"" exist as alleged in the present case under s 17(5)(b). Such a finding, in turn, has the capacity to produce a benefit for an offender who is to be sentenced in terms of the discount for a guilty plea. However, s 17(6) provides that: 

""6. The burden of establishing the matters referred to in subsection (5) lies on the offender and must be proved on the balance of probabilities."" 

34The deficiencies in the ""Certificate"" as indicated by the evidence in the present case involving a failure to meet the requirements of s 12(1) and (2) leads to the consequence, in my opinion, that the applicant failed to discharge the burden of proving that there existed in fact a Compulsory Conference Certificate in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 

The applicant's offer to plead guilty to the alternative charge was not an unequivocal one 

35There is, in my opinion, a further basis upon which the applicant was not entitled to rely upon the ""Conference Certificate"", even if it could be held that it was a valid Certificate. 

36It is clear on the evidence that the only dispute between the prosecution and the applicant at the conference related, not to the question of an offer to plead guilty to the alternative charge, but solely to the applicant's then insistence upon the plea being accepted on the basis of a statement of facts that he wished to reply upon, but which the Crown refused to accept as one that appropriately or properly recorded the factual substratum for sentencing purposes. 

37In the Disclosure Certificate prepared by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions dated 29 April 2009 and signed on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, it was stated: 

""B. The Prosecution will accept a plea of guilty to the following offences in full satisfaction on the basis of the draft facts attached. 

H/36656286/4 - Malicious inflict GBH with intent"" 

38The ""Outcome of Local Court Conference"" document (the Certificate), paragraphs 2 and 3, recorded the following: 

""2. The Accused person has offered to plead guilty to the following alternative charges not listed in the Prosecution Disclosure Certificate in full satisfaction of the prosecution case: 

(where accused offers to plead to different charges to those offered by the Prosecution - list charges Accused has offered) 

H/36656286/1 - Recklessly cause GBH (Sec.35). 

3. The Director of Public Prosecutions has rejected the offer of plea of guilty to the offence listed above, offered by the Accused Person, and intended to be in full satisfaction of the prosecution case..."" 

39In paragraph 4 of the document, the ""Charge Details"" are set out which included an offence under s 35 and the alternative offence under s 33. 

40The discussion between counsel and the sentencing judge as recorded in the transcript of 23 April 2010 (pp 3 - 4) made it clear that the offer to plead guilty to the alternative offence was rejected by the Crown by reason of the ""set of facts"" put forward on behalf of the applicant and for that reason only. The Crown stated (p 4): 

""McKAY: And the facts were not acceptable to the prosecution."" 

41When counsel referred to the fact that the Crown would only take a plea to a charge under s 33, the sentencing judge observed that that related to the question of the statement of facts, his Honour stating: 

""HIS HONOUR: Yes, that's because of the facts. That's why the Crown said that."" 

42The legal representative appearing for the accused on that occasion did not suggest otherwise and appeared to accept what the Crown had indicated was the basis for the rejection of the applicant's offer, stating: 

""WILLIAMS: Well, the Crown says that, I wasn't party to those negotiations."" 

43The case before this Court has been argued upon the basis that it was by reason only of the fact that the applicant was requiring agreement to a statement of facts that the Crown considered to be unacceptable that led it to reject the applicant's offer. The evidence indicates that the accused offered to plead guilty to the alternative charge and the Crown was prepared to accept the offer but for one matter. The disagreement, as I have stated, related to the applicant's requirement to accept the offer upon the basis of the statement of facts he put forward or that was put forward on his behalf. 

44In the particular circumstances of this case, I do not consider that it can be said that the Crown refused to accept ""an offer"" by the offender to plead guilty to the alternative offence. I will discuss below what may constitute an offer to enter a guilty plea which is capable of acceptance. 

45It cannot, in my opinion, be said that ""... an offer by the offender to plead guilty to the alternative offence set out in the Compulsory Conference Certificate... was refused by the prosecutor "" in the circumstances of this case in which the prosecution, was clearly prepared to accept a guilty plea to the alternative count on an appropriate basis. It was the offender's linking of the plea to the statement of facts he required which resulted in the refusal by the prosecutor to accept the plea but only on that basis. 

46In circumstances where a prosecutor has a duty to the Court (in this case, the District Court) to ensure that a proper factual basis for the plea is stated by agreement and/or otherwise proved, I do not consider that this is a case in which it can be said that the ""offer"" was one capable of being refused or rejected by the prosecutor for the purposes of s 17(5)(b). In the history of this case, the prosecutor's refusal related and related only to the terms of what could be seen to be an offer put on behalf of the accused, namely, that there be a plea of guilty to the alternative charge on the facts framed by him which were unacceptable to the Crown. 

47In that respect, the expression ""an offer"" in the phrase in s 17(5), ""An offer by the offender to plead guilty to an alternative offence"" must be considered by reference to the subject matter of an offer, namely, a plea of guilty to a criminal offence. For that purpose, guidance may be taken from relevant authority. 

48A plea of guilty is usually taken as an admission of all necessary ingredients of the offence charged: see Maxwell v The Queen [1996] HCA 46; (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 510. 

49It is well accepted that a plea of guilty must be unequivocal: Maxwell per Dawson and McHugh JJ at 511. 

50In S v Recorder of Manchester [1971] AC 481 at 491, Lord Reid stated: 

""[it] all depends upon whether the plea of guilty was unequivocal and finally accepted or was equivocal and only accepted provisionally."" 

51In Maxwell , in the discussion as to circumstances that may suggest that a plea is not a true admission of guilt, reference was made to circumstances such as fear, duress and a circumstance involving what may be described as a contrivance, namely (at 511): 

""... or even the desire to gain a technical advantage ..."" 

52Equally, in the application of s 17(5) of the Conferencing Trial Act , the reference to ""... an offer by the offender to plead guilty"" must mean an offer to enter a plea of guilty which is unequivocal in its terms. 

53The Crown's apparent hesitation at the conference in accepting the terms of the applicant's offer and its ultimate rejection of the offer put on behalf of the applicant, namely, that the Crown accept the version of facts put forward on his behalf, clearly supports the inference that the Crown felt bound to reject the offer by reason of it being advanced upon a basis that it considered was an unacceptable version of the facts. The Crown in that respect has an obligation to the sentencing court to ensure that the judge determining sentence has a proper basis for proceeding to undertake the sentencing of an offender. 

54The evidence, of course, establishes that, at the time of the sentencing hearing, a different statement of facts had been drawn up. It was upon that version that the sentencing of the applicant proceeded. 

55The decision whether to charge a lesser offence, or to accept a plea of guilty to a lesser offence than that charged, is for the prosecution and does not involve the approval of the Court: Maxwell at 513. However, a prosecutor would, in my opinion, be subject to the obligation to reject any offer to enter a guilty plea that is made subject to a qualification that the Crown is required to accept the offer upon the basis of a statement of facts which it considers does not properly reflect the elements of the offence or the matters relevant to the determination of culpability of an offender. The acceptance of an offer in those circumstances would directly impact upon the administration of justice by the sentencing court. The Crown in such a case in rejecting the offer to plead guilty, would be acting upon and giving effect to the principles that operate to prevent abuse of the Court's process (including the sentencing process). 

56An offer by an offender to plead guilty to an alternative offence under s 17(5) which is conditioned upon a requirement that the Crown accept a statement of facts put forward on behalf of the offender and which is not a proper statement cannot be considered to be an unequivocal offer made without qualification. An offer that is equivocal or qualified cannot, in my opinion be considered to be "" an offer "" within the meaning of s 17(5)(b). An offer such as that made by the applicant could not be said to be an unequivocal admission of guilt where the statement of underlying facts either do not properly reflect the elements constituting the offence or the true culpability of the offender. It would, in my opinion, be an offer that is contrary to the terms and evident intention of the legislature in relation to sentencing discounts for which s 17 of the Conferencing Trial Act makes provision. 

57In the circumstances outlined above, I do not consider that the applicant satisfied the onus under s 17(6) of the Act. 

58Accordingly, for the above reasons, I consider that Ground 1(iii) should be dismissed. 

Observation in relation to Ground 3 

59I would only add one further comment in relation to Ground 3 (the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive). As Harrison J has observed, the applicant was originally charged with an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes Act . 

60The agreed facts indicate that, although the Crown accepted that the applicant did not inflict grievous bodily harm upon the victim with intent to do so, his actions were, nonetheless so serious that, on any view, the offence to which he pleaded under s 35(2) would have to be regarded at the higher end of seriousness for such offences. 

61The offence for which the applicant was sentenced involved a series of deliberate acts. These included moving his vehicle towards the victim's vehicle causing the victim to become wedged between the vehicles, continuing to move his vehicle forward, causing the victim to fall to the ground and then again moving the vehicle forward with the right wheels running over the victim's legs. 

62Those actions produced an extremely high risk of injury which risk, unfortunately, came home with devastating consequences for the victim. The associated culpability of the applicant after all relevant matters had been assessed, required a very substantial sentence. 

63HARRISON J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him on 21 May 2010 by Sorby DCJ in the District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm on Winston Jarrett contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 . That offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 4 years. His Honour sentenced the applicant on 21 May 2010 to a term of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. He also disqualified the applicant from driving for a period of 3 years to date from the expiration of his non-parole period on 21 May 2016. 

64The applicant had originally been charged with two counts arising from an incident in which he drove a truck over Mr Jarrett on 25 June 2008. This is referred to in more detail later in these reasons. The principal charge was that of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act . The Crown ultimately accepted the applicant's plea to the s 35(2) charge in full satisfaction of the indictment on the first day fixed for the commencement of his trial on 1 September 2009. 

65The applicant relies on three grounds of appeal. They are as follows: 

Ground 1 : The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the applicant's plea of guilty and in particular 

(i) erred in reducing the discount for the guilty plea by finding that the plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity; 

(ii) erred in law by allowing the applicant an insufficient discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty; 

(iii) failed to take into account the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 (""the Act""). 

Ground 2 : A different less severe sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed. 

Ground 3 : The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 

66For the reasons that follow, I consider that leave to appeal should be granted but that the appeal should be dismissed. 

Background 

67The facts were agreed. The applicant was a truck driver with more than 15 years' experience with a transport company. On 25 June 2008 he started work at around 7.00am and in the normal course would have expected to complete his duties by about 4.00pm that day. He drove a nine tonne Hino tabletop truck used to deliver powdered milk to various locations in and around Sydney. 

68Just after midday on that day, the applicant was travelling south along Forest Way at French's Forest. At the same time Mr Jarrett was driving his Kenworth prime mover on the same road ahead of the applicant. Mr Jarrett's vehicle was in the lane turning left at Warringah Road and the applicant's vehicle was in the lane turning right. As Mr Jarrett's vehicle entered a sweeping left turn onto Warringah Road the applicant cut across in front of him. The vehicles came very close to each other. Shortly thereafter both vehicles stopped side by side in their respective lanes at traffic lights, with the applicant's vehicle on the left side of Mr Jarrett's vehicle. 

69Mr Jarrett got out of his vehicle and walked around to the driver's side of the applicant's vehicle. He struck the mirror on the truck with his hand and appeared to make a move toward the driver's side door handle as if about to open it. The door did not open. Mr Jarrett was situated between the two vehicles when the applicant drove forward and to his right. Mr Jarrett became wedged in an upright position between the two vehicles. The applicant continued moving forward, and Mr Jarrett fell to the ground a short distance in front of his truck. Mr Jarrett's upper body was under the corner of his truck but his legs protruded beneath the applicant's truck between its front and rear wheels. The applicant drove forward and the rear wheels of his truck ran over Mr Jarrett's legs. 

70Mr Jarrett sustained severe and extensive injuries. These included an open pelvic fracture, a lacerated liver, a ruptured bladder, a severe rectal injury, loss of portion of his lower bowel, a fracture of his right femur and an injury to his prostate. He was placed in an induced coma for nearly two months. 

71His Honour found that the offence was objectively serious and that the applicant's vehicle had caused very serious and extensive injuries to Mr Jarrett resulting in life long disabilities. His Honour found that the emotional loss and harm to Mr Jarrett was also substantial. He found that the offence fell well above the mid range of objective seriousness for such offences. 

Subjective features 

72The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. A psychological report from Ms Joan Langham dated 14 October 2009 was tendered on his behalf. The applicant reported that his mother had left his father when he was a child. He ran away from home during his adolescence and reported having been sexually abused as a child. He complained of anxiety and was extremely distressed when he saw Ms Langham. 

73Dr Seidler, the applicant's treating doctor, reported that he had had a heart attack in 1964 at the age of 20, and a hepatitis C infection. He had been referred to the diabetes clinic at St Vincent's Hospital. He had high blood pressure and exhibited signs of anxiety and depression, spending many hours in bed. He had been prescribed anti-depressant medication. The applicant had prior convictions, including two counts of assault in 1978 and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 1996. 

The applicant's argument 

74In his remarks on sentence his Honour commented as follows: 

""The plea entered by the [applicant] was not at the earliest opportunity but on the day of the trial, and I will allow twelve percent for the plea's utilitarian value in accordance with R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383."" 

75The applicant contended that his Honour fell into error inasmuch as he failed to have regard to the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act . Some of the relevant provisions of that Act are as follows: 

"" 12 Compulsory conference certificate 

(1) The prosecution and a legal representative who acted on the accused person's behalf at the conference must complete a compulsory conference certificate after a compulsory conference. 

(2) The compulsory conference certificate is to be signed by the prosecution and the accused person before it is filed in accordance with subsection (4). 

(3) The compulsory conference certificate is to certify as to the following matters: 

(a) the offence or offences (including any back up or related offences within the meaning of section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 ) with which the accused person had been charged before the conference and for which the prosecution will seek committal of the accused person for trial or sentence, 

(b) any alternative offences to those referred to in paragraph (a) discussed at the compulsory conference, 

(c) any of the offences referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) to which the accused person has offered to plead guilty, 

(d) whether the accused person or the prosecution has accepted or rejected any such offers, 

(e) if the accused person has offered to plead guilty to any offence and the offer has been accepted by the prosecution-details of the agreed facts on the basis of which the accused person has offered to plead guilty and details of facts (if any) in dispute, 

(f) any additional offences with which the accused person has been charged to which the accused person has offered to plead guilty and agreed to ask the court to take into account under section 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, 

(g) if the accused person considers the brief of evidence provided inadequate information to enable the accused person to assess the prosecution's case-details of the inadequacy. 

(4) ... 

13 Effect of compulsory conference certificate 

(1) Except as provided by this section, a compulsory conference certificate that has been filed, or a copy of such a compulsory conference certificate, is not admissible in any proceedings before any court, tribunal or body and such a certificate and any of its contents: 

(a) are not to be disclosed to any person other than the prosecution, a police officer, the accused person or the accused person's legal representative, the victim of the offence concerned or a member of the victim's immediate family (within the meaning of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996 ), and 

(b) cannot be required to be produced under a subpoena issued in any proceedings before any court, tribunal or body. 

(2) A compulsory conference certificate, or copy of a compulsory conference certificate, is admissible in any proceedings in a sentencing court for the purpose set out in section 17 (7) and is evidence of the matters certified in it. 

(3) A compulsory conference certificate, or copy of a compulsory conference certificate, and the contents of such a certificate may be disclosed for the purposes of a proceeding referred to in subsection (2). 

(4) A sentencing court must refuse to admit evidence of any compulsory conference certificate if any provisions of this Part with respect to the holding of the compulsory conference concerned or the preparation of the certificate have not been complied with unless it is satisfied that there was a good and proper reason for the failure to comply with the provision concerned and that it is in the interests of justice to admit the evidence. 

(5) A person who discloses the contents of a compulsory conference certificate, or copy of a compulsory conference certificate, in contravention of subsection (1) is guilty of an offence. 

16 Sentencing for certain indictable offences taking into account guilty plea 

(1) In passing sentence for an indictable offence on an offender who has pleaded guilty, a sentencing court: 

(a) must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the penalty it would have imposed but for the guilty plea, and 

(b) must allow a discount on the sentence for the guilty plea in accordance with section 17 (1) and may allow a discount in accordance with section 17 (2) or (4). 

(2) A discount for a guilty plea, in relation to an offence, means a discount for: 

(a) the saving in resources and time that would otherwise be expended in a trial for the offence but for the guilty plea, and 

(b) the avoidance of the additional trauma to the victim that might be caused by a trial for the offence, and 

(c) the contrition that the sentencing court considers that the offender demonstrates by pleading guilty, and 

(d) any other benefit associated with or demonstrated by the guilty plea. 

(3) ... 

(7) This section does not affect or limit any mitigating factor other than a guilty plea that a court may take account of in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence. 

(8) Sections 21A (3) (k) and 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 do not apply to the passing of a sentence to which this section applies. 

(9) A discount for a guilty plea is not to exceed the applicable limits provided in section 17. 


17 Discount for guilty plea 

(1) If an offender pleaded guilty to an offence at any time before being committed for sentence, the sentencing court must allow a discount for the guilty plea calculated as follows: 

(a) if the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term-a term that is 25% less than the term the court would otherwise have imposed, 

(b) if the court imposes a fine-a fine that is 25% less than the fine the court would otherwise have imposed, 

(c) if the court makes a community service order directing the performance of community service work for a specified number of hours-work for 25% less than the number of hours the court would otherwise have ordered to be performed, 

(d) if the court imposes a good behaviour bond for a term-a bond for 25% less than the term the court would otherwise have imposed. 

(2) If an offender pleaded guilty to an offence at any time after being committed for trial, the sentencing court may allow a discount for the guilty plea of up to 12.5% less than the term, fine, work or bond that it would otherwise have imposed. 

(3) However, when calculating the appropriate discount for the purposes of subsection (2), the court may only allow a discount that is proportionate to the remaining benefit of the guilty plea as determined by reference to the matters set out in section 16 (2). 

(4) A sentencing court may allow a discount under this section for a guilty plea that is greater than that referred to in subsection (2) (but not greater than that referred to in subsection (1)) if an offender has pleaded guilty to an offence after being committed for trial and the court is satisfied that substantial grounds exist as referred to in subsection (5) for allowing a greater discount. 

(5) For the purposes of subsection (4), substantial grounds exist for allowing a greater discount if: 

(a) the compulsory conference certificate in relation to the offence records an offer by the offender to plead guilty to an alternative offence set out in the compulsory conference certificate that was refused by the prosecutor at any time before committal for trial and the offender was subsequently found guilty of that alternative offence, or 

(b) the compulsory conference certificate records an offer by the offender to plead guilty to an alternative offence that was refused by the prosecutor at any time before committal for trial and accepted by the prosecutor after committal for trial, or 

(c) the offer to plead guilty to an alternative offence is made for the first time, and accepted, after committal for trial and the offender had no reasonable opportunity to offer to plead guilty to such an offence before the committal, or 

(d) the offender was found unfit to be tried for the offence concerned after being committed for trial and pleaded guilty to the offence when he or she was subsequently found fit to be tried. 

(6) The burden of establishing the matters referred to in subsection (5) lies on the offender and must be proved on the balance of probabilities. 

(7) The sentencing court may, for the purpose only of resolving any issue concerning the matters agreed to by parties at, or after, any compulsory conference held in respect of the offence to which the offender has pleaded guilty, or of making a determination in relation to any matter referred to in subsection (5), take into account the compulsory conference certificate relating to the conference."" 

76Having regard to the terms of s 17, it should be noted that on 14 May 2009 a case conference was held between the parties. The matter was then still in the Local Court. At that time the applicant offered to plead guilty to the s 35(2) offence, for which he was subsequently sentenced. That offer is contained in a Pre-Conference Disclosure Certificate that was tendered before his Honour. It is in these terms: 

""A conference was held with the prosecution and the accused person's legal representative on 14 May 2009 at Sydney. 

As a result of the conference the following is certified: 

1. The Prosecution has listed in the attached Disclosure Certificate those charges in which pleas are sought in full satisfaction of the prosecution case. 

2. The Accused person has offered to plead guilty to the following alternative charges not listed in the prosecution Disclosure Certificate in full satisfaction of the prosecution case: 

H36656286/1 - Recklessly cause GBH (sec. 35) 

3. The Director of Public Prosecutions has rejected the offer of a plea of guilty to the offence listed above, offered by the Accused Person and intended to be in full satisfaction of the prosecution case. 

4. The prosecution is seeking that the Accused Person be committed for trial on the following offences: 

Charge Details 

Recklessly cause GBH (sec. 35) 

Dangerous Driving occasioning GBH (sec. 52A(3)(c)) 

Fail to Stop (sec. 52AB(2)) 

Maliciously inflict GBH with Intent (sec. 33)."" 

77That certificate is a ""compulsory conference certificate"" for the purposes of ss 12 and13 of the Act. 

78Counsel for the applicant drew his Honour's attention to the 14 May 2009 offer to plead guilty. The transcript of what passed between his Honour and counsel at that time is instructive and is in the following terms: 

""WILLIAMS: Just in relation to the timing of the plea your Honour I hand up a document headed 'Disclosure Certificate' which outlines negotiations between legal representatives prior to the plea of guilty. Your Honour will see that there was an offer by the [applicant] through his lawyers to plead guilty to this charge at an earlier date. It was not then accepted by the Crown. That date being 14 May 2009. 

McKAY: I have no objection to this but my concern is, my recollection is and I stand corrected if my friend can - that I've seen documentation, attached with the offer to plea[d] was a set of facts which the defence was suggesting the offer was based on and they are facts different to what's being presented to you this morning. 

WILLIAMS: That is correct your Honour but... 

McKAY: And the facts were not acceptable to the prosecution. 

WILLIAMS: But the end result, your Honour, is that the Crown has said here the Crown would only take a plea to a charge under s 33. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes that's because of the facts. That's why the Crown said that. 

WILLIAMS: Well the Crown says that, I wasn't party to those negotiations. 

HIS HONOUR: No. Well I'll take it into account."" 

79Later during submissions his Honour asked about the discount for the plea of guilty. That appears in the following extract: 

""HIS HONOUR: What percentage do you say for the plea? 

WILLIAMS: I agree with my friend that between 10 and 15 per cent."" 

80Counsel for the applicant in this Court did not appear at the sentencing hearing. He submitted in this Court that it was unclear why his predecessor had made that concession before his Honour. Whatever may have been the reason, he submitted first that it could not be regarded as a concession that substantial grounds in accordance with s 17(4) did not exist, or secondly that the concession somehow cured his Honour's failure to engage or adequately to exercise the s 17(4) discretion. According to this submission, it followed that a greater discount should have been allowed and that in the circumstances some other sentence was warranted and should have been imposed at law in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 

81The applicant contended that the sentencing judge did not consider whether or not there were ""substantial grounds"" within the meaning of that expression in s 17(5) of the Act, upon the basis of which a discount of up to 25 per cent could have been allowed. The applicant submitted that this was an error. He referred to LJ v R [2010] NSWCCA 289 at [29] - [30] as follows: 

""[29] Both parties agreed in this Court, but not unfortunately before his Honour, that the Criminal Case Conferencing scheme applied to the applicant. As the plea had been entered before committal, s 17(1)(a) mandated a 25 per cent discount for the plea whereas the sentencing judge had allowed a discount of 15 per cent. In Do v R [2010] NSWCCA 182 and Tran v R [2010] NSWCCA 183, Hislop J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Barr AJ agreed) accepted the Crown's concession in those cases that the failure by the sentencing judge to give a 25 per cent discount when the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act applied was a material error, which required the sentence to be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced. 

[30] The failure to apply the mandated discount is an error of such materiality as to justify the Court's intervention, having regard to the terms of s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I am satisfied that ""some other sentence...is warranted in law and should have been passed."" The applicant is to be re-sentenced."" 

82The sentencing judge asked whether the applicant had pleaded at the ""first opportunity"" and was informed by the Crown that the applicant had pleaded guilty to the alternative count on the day of the trial. The Crown submitted that a discount of approximately 10 per cent was appropriate with 15 per cent being the ""upper limit"". 

The Crown's response 

83The Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act was not in terms referred to by the parties at the sentencing hearing, so that his Honour was not expressly alerted to any possible need to exercise his discretion under s 17 of the Act. However, the Crown submitted that a proper reading of the section indicates that the fundamental criteria for the fixing of discounts referred to in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 52 MVR 528 remain relevant where the plea is entered after the offender is committed for trial. 

84Earlier cases would appear only to have dealt with the situation where the statutory entitlement to a 25 per cent discount arose following a plea of guilty entered at committal. See, for example, Do v R [2010] NSWCCA 182 at [2]; Tran v R [2010] NSWCCA 183 at [2]; LJ v R at [3]; Greer v R [2011] NSWCCA 40 at [13] and Chompeay v R [2011] NSWCCA 96 at [11]. The Crown contended that the applicant's reliance on LJ v R was misplaced because that case involved a plea in the Local Court thereby engaging s 17(1) of the Act. In the present case, the Crown submitted that only s 17(5)(b) could be relevant at best. However, the Crown sought to argue that even that section did not apply, because there was a dispute about the facts upon which the applicant was prepared to plead and those upon which the Crown was prepared to accept that plea. 

85The Crown contended that the exercise of discretion contained in s 17 was still informed by the common law principles relating to discounts for early pleas. In relation to the award of a discount between 12.5 per cent and 25 per cent on ""substantial grounds"" in s 17(4), the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Regulation 2008 includes a standard form of written advice in plain English, which is to be given to accused persons under the case conferencing regime. Portion of the form is entitled ""Maximum sentence discount for guilty plea after committal for trial"" and includes the following: 

""If you plead guilty at any time after being committed for trial, a court may discount your sentence by up to 12.5% for the guilty plea depending on how much of a benefit will result from you pleading guilty at that stage of the proceedings. If the court considers there is no benefit gained from the guilty plea at that stage, no discount for the guilty plea will be allowed. 

In certain exceptional circumstances, you may be allowed a sentence discount of up to 25%."" 

86The Crown emphasised that this was consistent with the principles promoted in Borkowski . 

87The Crown submitted that irrespective of whether or not it was suggested that the discount should be below or above 12.5 per cent in the present case, the applicant's offer to plead guilty at the case conference stage in the Local Court was contingent upon a set of facts that was unacceptable to the Crown and the applicant did not in the end result attempt to prove those facts. Indeed, in due course facts were agreed. His Honour the sentencing judge was then entitled to determine the objective seriousness of the offence by reference to the facts as agreed. 

Supplementary submissions 

88As a result of some concerns that arose during the hearing of the application in this Court, on the question of the differing factual basis for the original offer to plead and those tendered as the basis for the plea that was ultimately accepted, the parties were invited to provide supplementary submissions. 

89The applicant confronted the issue of whether or not what the Crown described as his ""conditional"" offer was an ""offer"" for the purposes of s 17(5)(b) of the Act. The Crown contended that the applicant's offer to plead guilty was contingent upon a set of facts that were unacceptable to the Crown and that the applicant in the end did not attempt to prove them. In contrast the applicant contended that no such issue arose at the sentencing hearing and that there was no evidence before the sentencing judge about what were the facts underpinning the applicant's original offer to plead. The agreed facts upon the basis of which the applicant pleaded guilty were tendered in evidence. The applicant submitted that the difference between them and any earlier version was either uncertain or irrelevant. 

90The applicant sought to analyse the operation and effect of the statutory regime in the following way. If he fell within the terms of s 17(5)(b), the applicant was entitled to have the sentencing judge consider the exercise of a discretion to allow a discount of between 12.5 per cent and 25 per cent for a plea. However, there is no provision in the Act dealing with what is to occur in circumstances where there is a disagreement between the parties about the facts that should support a plea and for that reason the prosecution refuses to accept it. The applicant contended that this was to be contrasted with the position where an offer is accepted by the prosecution so that s 12(3)(e) applies. In such a case, details of the agreed facts on the basis of which the accused person has offered to plead guilty and details of facts (if any) in dispute must be certified. 

91The purpose of a compulsory conference is to determine whether there is any offence or there are any offences to which the accused person is willing to plead guilty and any other matters referred to in s 12(3) on which the accused person and the prosecution are able to reach agreement: s 6(3). Other than s 12(3), in cases where agreement has finally been reached, there is no provision in the Act enabling the parties to set out details of agreed or disputed facts. The applicant contended that the so-called conditional offer made by the accused to plead guilty at committal, which the Crown rejected, was an offer to plead guilty for the purposes of s 17(5)(b) of the Act. 

92The Crown also made further submissions. The Crown perceived that the applicant's argument was based upon an interpretation of the ""offer"" in s 17(5)(b) being limited to ""a plea of guilty to the elements of any given offence"" and that ""the facts are not elements of the offence"". The Crown argued that the applicant is therefore driven to the conclusion that even an offer to plead guilty to an offence contingent on facts that were said to traverse the guilty plea would still be an offer falling within s 17(5)(b) of the Act. 

93In stark contrast, the Crown contended that the ""offer"" for the purposes of s 17(5)(b) must include the set of facts that were offered as part of the offer to plead guilty to any particular charge. From first principles, the facts that are admitted by an accused person form the basis of the sentencing court's findings on matters such as the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence. Their influence and effect in this respect cannot be gainsaid. The facts, therefore, may determine whether or not the sentencing tribunal disposes of the case without recording a conviction at one extreme or imposes the maximum penalty for the offence at the other. 

94The importance of the facts is also recognised in the various provisions of the Act: see, for example, ss 6(1)(d), 6(2)(a), 6(3), 7(1)(a), 8, 9, 11(3), 12(3)(e) and 12(3)(g). 

95In the present case, the applicant's offer to plead to a s 35 offence before the committal clearly was not unconditional. There is, however, in the Crown's submission, a major difficulty posed by s 6(4) of the Act, which prevents the disclosure of anything said between the parties or any admission made during a compulsory conference or negotiations after the conference. The Crown submitted that this was unsatisfactory because justice otherwise dictated that the facts proposed by the defence should be disclosed. Any rejection by the Crown of an offer to plead guilty based upon those facts could then be taken into account either by this Court or the sentencing court and its reasonableness properly considered in assessing the extent of any discount. Section 6(4) creates a blanket exclusion over anything said in a compulsory conference. That would logically extend to include any ""agreed facts"". The further reference in s 6(4) to s 13 would not appear to assist, because s 17(7) only permits the court to consider the compulsory conference certificate, to which a set of ""rejected"" facts need not be annexed. 

96By way of contrast, the sentencing court and this Court can take account of the circumstances in which the offer to plead guilty was rejected by the Crown, because it formed part of the evidence before the sentencing judge and is available to this Court in the transcript of those proceedings. The matters revealed in the extract from the transcript set forth at [79] and [80] above were therefore properly and uncontroversially taken into account by the sentencing judge and are similarly available for consideration in this Court. 

97The Crown submitted that the applicant's interpretation of s 17(5)(b), that the ""offer"" to plead guilty is to be considered effectively in a vacuum unadorned by the underpinning facts, would produce the absurd result that any applicant could offer to plead guilty to an alternative or back up offence on patently unacceptable facts. If that led to a rejection of the plea by the Crown, the applicant could nevertheless choose later to plead guilty to the same charge on facts acceptable to the Crown, whilst simultaneously calling in aid s 17(5)(b) of the Act to argue for a discount exceeding that which might be available on common law principles as summarised in Borkowski . According to the Crown, this would potentially undermine the operation of the scheme of the Act and could not have been intended. 

98Finally, the burden of establishing the existence of ""substantial grounds"" in s 17(5)(b) lies on the applicant: s 17(6). In this case that would necessarily or at least arguably include the burden of establishing that the facts underpinning the rejected plea to the s 35 offence in the Local Court were not substantially or relevantly different to the agreed facts upon the basis of which the Crown ultimately accepted the applicant's plea of guilty. The applicant has not discharged that onus so that the relevant ground of appeal fails. 

Consideration 

99There does not appear to be any dispute between the parties that the applicant pleaded guilty to the s 35(2) offence after being committed for trial. So much is apparent from the applicant's submission that the plea falls squarely within the terms of s 17(5)(b) of the Act even despite the disagreement exposed in the passages from the transcript recorded above. On the other hand, the Crown relies upon that disagreement to support the contention that s 17(5)(b) does not apply. This is said to be because, even though the compulsory conference certificate records an offer by the offender to plead guilty to an alternative offence under s 35(2), which was refused by the prosecutor at some time before committal for trial, the plea that was ultimately accepted by the prosecutor after committal for trial was based upon different facts. On this basis, according to the Crown, s 17 was not relevantly engaged at all so that his Honour's failure to refer to it was both explicable and inconsequential. 

100The first question to be determined therefore is whether the Criminal Case Conferencing scheme applies to the applicant and whether he falls within s 17(5)(b) of the Act. 

101The applicant certainly offered to plead to a charge pursuant to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act prior to his committal. He ultimately did so at his trial. A compulsory conference certificate issued. It was tendered in the sentencing proceedings. The literal terms of s 17(5)(b) were satisfied. That triggered a basis upon which the applicant was able to contend that he was entitled to a discount of between 12.5 and 25 per cent. However, it is critical to understand precisely what is encompassed in this case by the words ""an offer"" in the expression ""records an offer by the offender to plead guilty to an alternative offence"" in s 17(5)(b). The offer is both the offer ""that was refused by the prosecutor at any time before committal for trial and accepted by the prosecutor after committal for trial"" (emphasis added). It would seem to be apparent that the reference to ""an offer"" in s 17(5)(b) that has been rejected and then later accepted is a reference to the same offer. 

102If an accused person has offered to plead guilty to any offence and the offer has been accepted by the prosecution, the compulsory conference certificate must certify details of both the agreed facts on the basis of which the accused person has offered to plead guilty as well as details of any facts in dispute: s 12(3)(e). The applicant in the present case offered to plead guilty to a s 35(2) offence but the prosecution declined to accept that offer. This is said to be because there was a disagreement about the facts. However, it would appear from the terms of s 12(3)(e) that what should have happened is that the applicant's offer to plead guilty to the offence should have been accepted upon the basis of facts that were agreed whilst specifying the facts that remained in dispute. This regime appears to contemplate what amounts to the conditional acceptance of an offer. In the events that occurred, there was no acceptance of any offer, conditional or otherwise. That had at least two consequences. First, there was no reference in the compulsory conference certificate to any disputed facts. Secondly, and for that reason, the applicant has potentially been deprived of an opportunity to qualify as a s 17(5)(b) offender and establish ""substantial grounds"". 

103In my opinion, the applicant does qualify as a s 17(5)(b) offender. There can be no doubt that a proper understanding of the facts that underpin a plea of guilty is critical to the sentencing process. The Act anticipates the distinction between agreed and disputed facts. The compulsory conference certificate in this case was silent about disputed facts. The applicant promotes the certificate in support of his attempt to establish the existence of ""substantial grounds"" for the purposes of s 17(4). He is in my view entitled to rely upon what the certificate says for that purpose. It remained open to the Crown to establish that there were good reasons for the rejection of the plea before committal if it wished to do so. That follows from the fact that the disputed facts could have been included in the certificate in accordance with the s 12 procedures. 

104Discussions and negotiations between an offender and the Crown will usually, if not always, involve competing views about the grounds upon which the plea is offered and the grounds upon which it will be accepted. The applicant's submission proceeds upon the basis that provided the charge to which the offender relevantly offers to plead and the charge in respect of which the Crown is willing to accept a plea remains the same, there is no basis for preventing the applicant from establishing s 17(5)(b) ""substantial grounds"" just because the disputed facts are not specified in the compulsory conference certificate. I agree. 

105The next question that arises is whether or not, if the Criminal Case Conferencing scheme did apply to the applicant, his Honour fell (or was led) into error in failing to refer to or apply s 17(5)(b) of the Act when passing sentence, with the result that the sentencing proceedings miscarried. The applicant contends that he did and that he was thereby deprived of the opportunity to argue the existence of ""substantial grounds"" for a discount between 12.5 and 25 per cent. The Crown contended that it did not matter that his Honour did not specifically refer to or apply s 17(5)(b) in terms, because it was open to him to give a discount up to 25 per cent in any event in accordance with the common law. This much was said to be apparent from the general discussion by both counsel of a discount up to as much as 15 per cent. 

106As appears above, his Honour remarked that the applicant did not enter a plea ""at the earliest opportunity"". It is apparent that in expressing the matter in that way, his Honour intended to refer to the fact that the plea was entered ""on the day of the trial"". It also seems clear, therefore, that in so saying his Honour was not dealing with the applicant upon the basis that he was a s 17(5)(b) offender. In my opinion this amounts to an error, as the applicant contends in Ground 1, because he failed to take the provisions of the Act into account. The compulsory conference certificate establishes that the applicant offered to plead at committal and well before ""the day of the trial"". 

107The next issue to be determined is what, if anything, flows from that error. For example, it was always open to his Honour to have declined to find that a discount in the range of between 12.5 per cent and 25 per cent was warranted, despite the existence of the s 17(5)(b) ""substantial grounds"". This was a finding that was open to him as a matter of discretion. This case is different to LJ v R in that respect. I do not consider that this is a case where the exercise of the sentencing discretion miscarried because, for example, his Honour erroneously disregarded the 12.5 to 25 per cent range for discounts within which he was bound by the terms of the Act to operate. The error was in not taking that range into account, not in failing to find a discount that fell within it. 

108Even if I am wrong about this, I do not consider that any less severe sentence is warranted in law or should have been passed. The applicant made the following submission in support of Ground 3: 

""[54] The offence carried ... a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 4 years. The starting point for the sentencing judge before plea was a little over 9 years imprisonment. This is indicative of the fact that the sentencing judge gave very little effect to any subjective circumstances and imposed a sentence which failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed and proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the crime committed."" 

109I do not consider that this necessarily follows. As the applicant's submissions otherwise accept, the imposition of the maximum penalty for any offence should be reserved for those cases that can properly be characterised as falling within the worst category of cases for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451 - 452. The sentence imposed in the present case was close to the maximum. It was not suggested at the sentencing hearing that the offence fell within the worst category. However, his Honour found that it fell ""well above the mid-range of objective seriousness"". The injuries caused to the victim are relevant in this respect and his Honour was obviously influenced by them. He was in my view entitled to be. I am not satisfied that his Honour fell into error in imposing the sentence that he imposed. A sentence that commences ""very close to the maximum penalty"" is not of itself demonstrative of error in general and is not so in this case in particular. The sentence imposed by his Honour is stern, but it is in my opinion neither unreasonable nor plainly unjust. 

Conclusion and orders 

110I would propose the following orders: 

1. Grant leave to appeal. 

2. Dismiss the appeal.

		22 November 2012",2011-09-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709141,R v AMBO [2011] NSWDC 156,"Judgment  APPLICATION FOR A DIRECTED VERDICT  1At the conclusion of the Crown case, Counsel for the accused made an application for a directed verdict. These are my reasons for rejecting that application.  INDICTMENT  2The accused is charged with one count on an indictment as follows:  Between about 5 February 2011 and about 8 February 2011 in the waters between the Republic of Indonesia and the Territory of Christmas Island, Australia, facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of five or more people, namely a group of fifty-three people who were non-citizens and travelled to Australia and who had, or have, no lawful right to come to Australia, and he did so reckless as to whether those people had or have a lawful right to come to Australia .  OFFENCE  3The charge has been brought against the accused under section s 233C of the Migration Act which provides:  (1)  A person (the first person ) commits an offence if:  (a) the first person organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia, or the entry or proposed entry into Australia, of a group of at least 5 persons (the other persons ); and  (b) at least 5 of the other persons are non-citizens; and  (c) the persons referred to in paragraph (b) who are non-citizens had, or have, no lawful right to come to Australia.  Penalty: Imprisonment for 20 years or 2,000 penalty units.  ELEMENTS  4The elements of this offence are as follows; that the accused:  (1) Organised or facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia a group of at least 5 persons;  (2) At least 5 of the other persons are non-citizens of Australia;  (3) Those 5 persons who are non-citizens of Australia had or have no lawful right to come to Australia.  5It is the third element which raises the issue in this application, that is, the meaning of the phrase ' had or have no lawful right' as it applies to the relevant persons in this case.  FACTS  6On 8 February 2011 a SIEV (Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel) was apprehended in Australian waters off Christmas Island containing 55 persons. Two of them (the accused - who comes from Sulawesi, Indonesia - and his nephew) were said to be the crew of the vessel. The remaining 53 were said to be stateless or from either Iran or Iraq.  All had boarded that vessel in Indonesia which had travelled towards Australia in a journey that lasted about sixty hours.  7The SIEV was boarded by a Royal Australian Navy boarding party from HMAS Maitland. The SIEV was taken to Christmas Island where those on the vessel were off-loaded, processed and detained, initially in the Christmas Island detention centre and then subsequently in other centres on Christmas Island. Evidence was given from seven of those passengers, all of whom are currently in immigration detention.  8A number of others from that vessel have been given protected status. There is no evidence before me as to the basis for whatever applications were made in each of those cases. This is said to be relevant in terms of the Defence submission that it always was possible for such applications to be made by any person on the relevant vessels.  9Evidence has been given that those who had passports from other countries or who had false passports gave them to various persons immediately prior to their embarkation onto the SIEV. Those passports were either destroyed or not returned to them or in one case, thrown overboard. All seven have given evidence that they did not have Australian visas at all relevant times.  APPLICATION  10Against this background, Counsel for the accused has sought that I direct a verdict of acquittal on the basis that:  (a) those on the boat had a lawful right to come to Australia; or, in   the alternative  (b) the Crown has not proved that they did not have a lawful right to come to Australia.  11Mr Kerkyasharian submits that, on either of these bases, the passengers on the SIEV had a lawful right to come to Australia in that they could subsequently apply for asylum and/or refugee status. Accordingly, the jury cannot be satisfied that the people had no lawful right to come to Australia and consequently, there should be a verdict of acquittal.  12The Crown opposes the application. It is submitted that the passengers on the SIEV did not have visas at the time they were apprehended travelling from Indonesia to Australia. In brief summary, the Crown case is that they did not have visas and consequently did not have a lawful right to come to Australia.  VICTORIAN COURT OF APPEAL STATED CASE  13Both parties have referred to a similar or related case - Cth DPP v Jeky Payara - where the same issue has been the subject of a stated case to the Victorian Court of Appeal.  Defence counsel has tendered on the voir dire the submissions made to that Court by both the Appellant and the Commonwealth DPP (MFI 1).  14The stated case before the Victorian Court of Appeal is as follows:  (1)  Does a person who wants to come to Australia for the purpose of seeking asylum from persecution have a 'lawful right to come to Australia' within the meaning of section 233C(c) of the Migration Act (Cth) 1958?  (2) If a person who enters Australia for the purpose of seeking asylum from persecution is subsequently granted asylum did they have a 'lawful right to come to Australia' within the meaning of section 233C(c) of the Migration Act at the point that they entered Australia?  (3)  If the answer to either question 1 or 2 is yes, what circumstances must the prosecution prove to establish that the ""other persons"" referred to in section 233C(c) of the Migration Act had 'no lawful right to come to Australia'?  15It is agreed that section 233C requires that persons brought to Australia had 'no lawful right to come to Australia' .  There is no statutory definition for the phrase 'no lawful right to come to Australia' . No application has been made for me to state a case on this matter.  SUBMISSIONS  16A summary of the respective submissions relied on in this case is as follows:  17ACCUSED  Counsel for the Appellant in the Victorian stated case makes the following arguments:  18The entitlement to seek asylum from persecution founds a lawful right to come to Australia, at least for those people whose claim for asylum is ultimately accepted.  19Section 233C of the Migration Act does not specifically equate the lack of a valid visa with the absence of a lawful right to come to Australia.  If Parliament had intended this, it could have used the language 'unlawful non-citizen'. An earlier provision establishing this offence used this device: Section 232A of the Migration Act referred to 'unlawful non-citizens' .  20The use of the alternatives 'had or have' in the wording of the section suggests that an entitlement to come to Australia can be determined after the fact through an assessment of refugee status.  The phrase 'or have' must be intended to capture something not captured by the word 'had' . The word 'have' in this context must logically refer to a later point in time.  If the word 'had' denotes the position at the time of the conduct, the words 'or have' are otherwise redundant.  21People seeking asylum from persecution have a right to come to Australia to seek such asylum; international law imposes positive obligations in relation to treatment of asylum seekers regardless of how those asylum seekers arrive.  Australia has imported these international obligations into its domestic law through the Migration Act .  22The right to come to Australia as referred to in s 233C is no more than a right to present at the border and make a claim for asylum, however, a 'right' to 'come to Australia' includes a right to present at Australia's borders to seek asylum.  23International law is relevant to contextualise the phrase 'lawful right to come to Australia' and can be used as a tool of statutory interpretation. Article 14(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives everybody the right to 'seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.' This does not impose an obligation on States to grant asylum but it does impose on States an obligation not to obstruct a person's lawful right to seek asylum.  Reference is made by Counsel for the Appellant in the Victorian matter to Article 33 of the Convention and s 36 of the Migration Act .  24Mr Kerkyasharian, Counsel in the present case, also submits that section 503 of the Migration Act is the determinative provision in that it specifies categories of people who cannot lawfully come to or remain in Australia.  He submits that none of the relevant persons in this case fall within those categories.  He also refers to the Crown submission that section 42 of the Act requires everybody who comes to Australia to have a valid visa, and that a person without a current, valid visa is unlawfully in Australia.  He argues that section 42 in itself provides some exemptions from holding a visa, some of which are ex post-facto, i.e., they only apply after a person arrives in the migration zone.  Accordingly he submits that the absence of a visa does not equate with 'no lawful right' .  25Mr Kerkyasharian further submits that, if I find - contrary to his submission - that s 42 is the relevant provision, a visa is not required to travel to Australia if a non-citizen is brought into the migration zone under 42(2A) - the power relating to detain people found on an intercepted off-shore boat. He asserts that the Crown has not proved that the people were not taken off the ship and taken into the migration zone.  There is evidence in the Crown case that the people were taken to Christmas Island but no evidence that they were not later taken into the migration zone; in fact, seven of the witnesses came to Sydney to give evidence.  In this event, he submits that s 42(1) does not apply and the Crown case fails as it is predicated on these people requiring a visa to come to Australia.  26In relation to the wording 'had or have' in the section, Mr Kerkyasharian submits that these words should not be read down so that only the word 'had' applies.  Given the serious nature of the charge, Counsel submits that the words 'or have' should be given their plain meaning.  He refers to the fact that the Crown has not led any evidence to show that applications for asylum and /or refugee status have been denied.  27Mr Kerkyasharian also asserts that the existence of a scheme whereby people seeking asylum can apply for refugee status evinces a lawful right for them to do so.  In the alternative, Counsel argues that the Act does not take away a right to apply for asylum.  On this basis, people seeking asylum have a lawful right to come to Australia and to make such an application.  28CROWN  The Crown opposes the application and relies on the Commonwealth Crown submissions in the Victorian stated case in CDPP v Jeky PAYARA . In essence the Commonwealth submission is that to travel without a visa is to travel without a lawful right to come to Australia. A person claiming asylum does not thereby obtain a lawful right to travel to or enter Australia and that the provisions of the Act specifically provide against that.  29The Crown in the Victorian stated case has submitted that s 233C(1)(c) is clear, that there is no uncertainty surrounding the definition of the element. The 'lawful right' referred to in s 233C(1)(c) is a right under domestic law and such a right only arises from the granting of a visa pursuant to the Act. In other words, if the people who form part of the 'group' coming to Australia do not have valid visas, this element of the offence is satisfied.  30The right of asylum is not an individual right to assert a right to enter a State or territory and insist on being received.  The Crown reiterates the obligation on States not to return asylum seekers to the place of persecution.  31The Crown further relies on the ""Object"" section of the Migration Act , section 4 , which states at (b) : ""... the Parliament intends that this Act be the only source of the right of non-citizens to so enter..."" Accordingly, the Migration Act requires non-citizens to enter Australia lawfully.  32S 42 of the Migration Act states that, inter alia, ""a non citizen must not travel to Australia without a visa that is in effect."" The Crown asserts that the accused's claim that a genuine asylum seeker without a visa has a lawful right to come to Australia is difficult to reconcile with this provision and other provisions of the Act that indicate that legitimate entry is dependent on possession of a valid visa.  33In response to the Defence submissions in regard to the wording 'had or have', the Crown asserts that it is the status of the other person at the time the accused engaged in the conduct that is relevant.  A subsequent change of status (for example, as would occur with the granting of a protection visa) does not exonerate an accused nor retrospectively give a person who entered unlawfully a lawful right to come to Australia.  34Mr Lee, Counsel for the Commonwealth DPP in this matter, has referred me first to customary international law to look at the implications of conventions and protocols relating to refugees and asylum seekers and then refers to domestic law, specifically, the Migration Act .  35Counsel for the Crown referred me to the following cases: NAGV & NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration  & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs (2005) 222 CLR 161; Minister for Immigration v Ibrahim (2000) 204 CLR 1; T v Home Secretary [1996] AC 742; Applicant A v Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs (1996-1997) 190 CLR 225; Nguyen Tuang Cuong v Director of Immigration [1997] 1 WLR 68; R v Mahendra [2011] NTSC 57 which advance the following principles.  International law deals with the right of asylum as a right of states, not individuals; individuals cannot act outside municipal legal systems.  The contents of Conventions do not detract from the right of a States to determine who shall enter its territory ( NAGV, applied in Ibrahim ).  The Privy Council case of Nguyen refers to the fact that refugee status is not an international passport that entitles one to demand entrance into a contracting state.  The only active obligation on states is not to punish asylum seekers or return them to the claimed country of persecution.  36The Crown submits that Australian law is determinative as to whether travel to or entry into Australia is lawful or unlawful.  In relation to the Object of the Act , Mr Lee refers me to sub-sections 1-3 of the s 4 of the Act , particularly sub-section 1 where the purpose of the Act includes the regulation of the 'coming into ' Australia by non-citizens.  37Mr Lee has referred to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Anti-People Smuggling & Other Measures Bill (C'th) 2010 where s 233C is discussed. The Crown asserts that reference to the third element of 'lawful right' addresses proposed entry in terms of compliance with Australian law. He submits that the combined effect of sections 29 and 42 of the Migration Act is that a person's lawful right to enter is dependent on the grant of a visa. Those provisions together with the combined effect of sections 188-189 determine if a person seeking asylum has a lawful right to travel to/enter Australia.  38In response to Defence submissions regarding the applicability of s 503 , Mr Lee notes that s 503 is contained in Part 9 of the Act titled 'Miscellaneous' .  The Crown submits that it is illogical that the determinative section regarding lawful or unlawful entry into Australia would be placed in this section rather than within Part 2 , titled 'Control of Arrival and Presence of Non-Citizens'. Mr Lee notes that sections 29 and 42 are in Part 2 .  Further, Mr Lee asserts that s 503 is restrictive in its terms and applies specifically to sections 200-203 .  39In response to the Defence assertion that a person brought into the migration zone at a later point in time does not require a visa, Mr Lee argues that the submission ignores the extra-territorial applicability of the offence provision of s 233C . Further, it cannot be the case that the exceptions listed in 42(2A) have the retrospective effect of validating what, up until that point, would otherwise be unlawful travel.  40On the matter of the offence containing the words 'had or have' , the Crown submits that the focus of the provision is on the conduct at the relevant time; in this case, when the SIEV was intercepted by the RAN.  The word 'have' correlates with s 4.1 of the Criminal Code - the physical element of the offence; which refers to the circumstances in which the conduct occurred. The Explanatory Memorandum relates the phrase 'had or have' to ' does not or would not comply with the entry requirements under Australian law' .  The Crown submits that this mirrors the section in reference to a specific point in time.  41In reply, Defence asserts that to cover conduct at the relevant point in time, the word 'had' would cover this situation.  The word 'have' should be given its natural and ordinary meaning.  LAW  42In The Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 287; 1995 HCA 20, the High Court addressed the relationship between domestic Australian law and international law, establishing that there are international rights which exist but that they may be overborne by clear domestic legislation to the contrary.  The subsequent case-law referred to me by the Crown confirms this approach.  43In Plaintiff M70/2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship; M106/2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2011] HCA 32, Kiefel J summarised the position at [247] and following:  In Polites v The Commonwealth ( (1945) 70 CLR 60 at 68-69 per Latham CJ (citing Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 8th ed (1937) at 130), 77 per Dixon J and 81 per Williams J; [1945] HCA 3) it was accepted that a statute is to be interpreted and applied, so far as its language permits, so that it is in conformity, and not in conflict, with established rules of international law. (A similar approach had been applied in Jumbunna Coal Mine NL v Victorian Coal Miners' Association (1908) 6 CLR 309 at 363 per O'Connor J (citing Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 3rd ed (1896) at 200); [1908] HCA 95.) In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 287; [1995] HCA 20) , Mason CJ and Deane J took the proposition to apply to favour the construction of a statute which is in conformity, and not in conflict, with Australia's international obligations, at least so far as the language of the legislation permits.  The ambiguity, to which such a construction was relevant, should not be viewed narrowly, in their Honours' view.  Their Honours went on to say (Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 287-288.  See also Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam (2003) 214 CLR 1 at 33 [100]; [2003] HCA 6.) :  ""So expressed, the principle is no more than a canon of construction and does not import the terms of the treaty or convention into our municipal law as a source of individual rights and obligations.""  The rule of construction stated in Teoh has been applied in Kartinyeri v The Commonwealth ((1998) 195 CLR 337 at 384 [97] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; [1998] HCA 22.), Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth ((2003) 211 CLR 476 at 492 [29] fn 64 per Gleeson CJ; [2003] HCA 2), and Coleman v Power ((2004) 220 CLR 1 at 27-28 [19] per Gleeson CJ; [2004] HCA 39).  44International law recognises that a state has the right to regulate its own position in regard to refugees. Relevant authorities make it clear that the Convention does not confer on refugees or those claiming refugee status the capacity to act outside the municipal or domestic legislation. Similarly, a contracting state can determine who should be allowed to enter its territory - R v Ibrahim [2000] 204 CLR 1 per Gummow J at [137 ]; Applicant A v MIEA (1996-1997) 190 CLR 225 at 273; and in the UK, T v Immigration Officer [1996] AC 742 at 754B. That approach is also confirmed in Article 26 of the Convention itself.  45In that regard Australian law is determinative as to whether travel to and entry to Australia is lawful or unlawful. The relevant Australian domestic law is the Migration Act . In the context of this case, I do not see any conflict between the Migration Act and relevant principles of international law. Even if there was, the provisions of the statute must be enforced, if and to the extent to which they amount to a contravention of accepted principles of international law  - Kartinyeri v The Commonwealth (1998) 195 CLR 337 at 384 [97] per Gummow and Hayne JJ, citing Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 204; [1982] HCA 27).  46Nor do I see that there is any ambiguity about the provisions of the Migration Act . The relevant part of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill (2010) concerning the relevant section under which this indictment has been laid - s 233C - sets out that the legislation is aimed at:  ""strengthening the Commonwealth's anti-people smuggling legislative framework by ensuring that an appropriate range of offences are available to target and deter people smuggling activity and by creating greater harmonisation across Commonwealth legislation.  The Bill will put in place laws to provide greater deterrence of people smuggling activity and to address the serious consequences of such activity.""  47That in turn reflects the Migration Act in the objectives - s 4 , the specification that visas are the basis for the right to enter or remain in Australia - s 29, and the unequivocal statement in s 42(1) that a person must not travel to Australia without a visa.  CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS  48The issue of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the travel for the passengers on the SIEV in this case was determined at the time of their entry to Australia in the territorial waters off Christmas Island.  49The reference in the Explanatory Memorandum to the words 'have or had' being akin to 'does not or would not' are relevant in this regard to determine the interpretation intended by Parliament. The Explanatory Memorandum goes on to explain that this means that the ""bringing or coming, or entry or proposed entry, does not or would not comply with the entry requirements under Australian law."" In my view the words 'would not' do not import some future entitlement to claim protection; rather, those words cover a situation where a person has already entered Australia.  50Against the background of the matters set out, there does not seem to be any ambiguity about the Commonwealth position as set out in the legislation. I see no reason why the phrase 'a lawful right to come to Australia' should be interpreted in this case to mean that any subsequent determination that one of the passengers on the SIEV is a refugee, can retrospectively entitle such an applicant to have a 'lawful right' to come to Australia at the time they were apprehended.  51I do not accept the submissions advanced in relation to the effect that s 503 rather than s 42 provides for what constitutes 'unlawfulness' .  That section is concerned with specific categories of applicants in referring to sections 200-203 .  52The third element of the offence on which the jury will be directed is the circumstance that the persons coming to Australia 'had or have no lawful right to come' . That does not import a requirement to consider a possible future entitlement. Once in Australia, a person has a right to claim asylum. But that does not affect their status as having arrived unlawfully and without a visa and, under Australian law, becoming unlawful non-citizens.  53I reject the submission that I should direct the jury that the passengers on the SIEV vessel who accompanied the accused were persons who had a lawful right to come to Australia.  54In my view the interpretation sought by Defence counsel would require either legislative amendment to the Migration Act , or a contrary interpretation by a higher court following consideration of the relevant provisions by a higher court. I am bound to apply the law as it applies at this time.  RULING  55I reject the application for a directed verdict of acquittal.  **********

		13 October 2011",2011-09-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709150,R v Salvatore Vincenzo CUTRALE [2011] NSWCCA 214,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 

2HIDDEN J: This is a Crown appeal against sentences imposed upon the respondent, Salvatore Vincenzo Cutrale, after his committal to the District Court for sentence on the following charges: 

(1) Attempt to choke or strangle with intent to enable himself to commit an indictable offence, an offence under s 37 of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years; 

(2) Sexual intercourse without consent, an offence under s 61I of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 14 years. 

3On the first charge he was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months, to commence on 31 October 2009, the date of the offences and of his arrest. On the second charge he was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months, also to date from 31 October 2009. The sentences were, then, wholly concurrent. The pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest opportunity and his Honour allowed a discount of 25% for their utilitarian value. The sentencing judge's starting point for the first charge was 12 years imprisonment, and for the second charge 9 years and 3 months. 

Facts 

4The two charges arise from a very serious incident which occurred in the small hours of Friday, 31 October 2009 in the Glebe area. The respondent was 39 years old at the time. The victim, who was unknown to him, was a young English woman who had arrived in Australia in the previous month on a working visa. She was living with her boyfriend in a home unit near Wentworth Park. She had been socialising with some co-workers and caught a taxi back to the units, arriving at about 1am. 

5She got out of the taxi and walked towards her unit block. The respondent came from behind her, grabbed her, knocked her off balance and pulled her into Wentworth Park. She ended up lying on her back and the respondent placed a hand around her throat and squeezed it, so that she could not breathe. He placed his other hand across her mouth and nose, again preventing her from breathing in or out. He lay on top of her, preventing her from moving. She thought she was going to be killed, and began to kick and scratch the respondent. He lay over her legs to stop her. She continued to scratch him on the face and neck with her fingernails. She tried to call for help, but she could not because of the pressure of the offender's hands on her throat and over her mouth and nose. He told her to shut up. She blacked out. 

6A man who lived nearby heard the sound of moaning and a female voice, which sounded distressed. He went to the park and approached the area where the respondent and the victim were. It seems that he could see two people in the park, but not clearly. He asked if they were okay and a male voice yelled, ""Fuck off, you idiot."" He then saw the respondent and the victim, who were unknown to him, the respondent lying on his side and the victim in his arms. Her top was pulled up. He heard her voice, which was muffled, but thought she was laughing. He thought that they were having sex and, embarrassed, he turned away and returned to his unit. 

7The victim regained consciousness, still lying on the ground. She was disoriented. Her top and bra had been pulled down, exposing her breasts, and her shoes, leggings and underwear had been removed. She saw the respondent crouching near her and noticed that his face was bleeding, apparently as a result of her scratching him. He said, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" Still disoriented, she thought he was trying to help her. Her mobile phone was next to her. She called her boyfriend, saying that she thought she was going to die and that she did not know where she was or what had happened to her. He told her to go towards the lights. She handed her phone to the respondent, who told the boyfriend that they were in a grass field somewhere but he did not know where. The boyfriend noticed that he spoke slowly and that he sounded ""very dopey."" 

8The victim adjusted her clothing as best she could, but could not find some of the items which had been removed. Her contact lenses had been dislodged during the incident and she had difficulty seeing, but she could identify her unit block. She called her boyfriend again, who met her outside and found her to be extremely distressed. He called the police. 

9The victim was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, where a sexual assault kit was prepared. Subsequent testing of swabs revealed the presence of semen in her vagina, consistent with the respondent having had intercourse with her while she was unconscious. At the hospital she complained of extreme pain to her neck, and a number of injuries to her face and right hand were noted. The injuries to her face included pinpoint bruises below the eyebrows and subconjunctival haemorrhage in both eyes. 

10A doctor from the hospital's sexual assault service reported that the facial injuries indicated blunt force trauma from being held around the chin and neck, and that the bruising and haemorrhage indicated sufficient force to cause a rise in venous pressure and subsequent unconsciousness. The doctor stated that a strangulation injury causing unconsciousness is ""extremely serious and has been known to result in death or brain damage."" Fortunately, the victim did not sustain any long-term serious injury of a physical nature. Not surprisingly, however, there were grave psychological sequelae. 

11When police arrived at the scene, they found the respondent still in Wentworth Park, although a considerable distance from where the incident had occurred. He appeared to be sleepy and was unsteady on his feet, and they concluded that he was intoxicated by alcohol or some other drug. Police observed that his face was covered in blood and he had scratches around his neck and other parts of his body. He told them that he had been robbed by a number of men, who had hit him with a steel pole. He later took part in a limited electronically recorded interview but, as I understand it, made no admissions. He was charged, and has remained in custody since his arrest. 

12The sentencing judge received a victim impact statement in which the victim expressed eloquently the physical and enduring psychological effects upon her of this terrifying experience. 

13At the sentence proceedings the respondent gave evidence that on the day in question he had had a good deal to drink and had also taken some Endone tablets for headaches, which he said he had been suffering since he had been the victim an assault in September 2008. He gave an account of the offences in which he sought to minimise his culpability by reference to his intoxication. The sentencing judge did not accept this evidence, saying that he was ""mightily unimpressed"" by it. 

Subjective case 

14The appeal does not require any examination of the respondent's background, about which he also gave evidence. His criminal history is not of significance. It includes a conviction in Queensland for indecent assault for which he was sentenced to a short term of imprisonment, but that offence was committed in 1991. His Honour did not find him to be remorseful about the present offences, and was unable to arrive at any conclusion about his prospects of rehabilitation. 

The appeal 

15The focus of the Crown's appeal was his Honour's imposition of wholly concurrent sentences for the two offences. His Honour passed concurrent sentences because he concluded that the two offences constituted ""one course of criminal conduct."" The Crown prosecutor in this Court conceded that the sentence for each offence, while lenient, was within range. However, she submitted that the order that they be served concurrently resulted in an aggregate sentence which fails to reflect the totality of the respondent's criminality and is, accordingly, manifestly inadequate. 

16The Crown prosecutor referred to R v MW [2007] NSWCCA 291. That was a Crown appeal against sentences imposed for offences committed in an incident somewhat similar to the present case. That offender pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, being the infliction of actual bodily harm, and attempting to choke with intent to commit an indictable offence, being sexual intercourse without consent. He also asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of committing an act of indecency. The aggravated sexual assault offence carried a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

17The offender was the victim's stepfather. His relationship with her mother had been volatile, and during an argument between them a matter of days before the offences the victim had called the police (as she had done on previous occasions). On the occasion in question the offender lured the victim to a reserve, apparently bent on venting his anger at her calling the police. He tried, unsuccessfully, to gag her and threatened to kill her. During a struggle she was forced to the ground, and he inserted his finger into her vagina. She was crying, and he told her to shut up and punched her several times to the face. This constituted the aggravated sexual assault. He then tried to put his penis into her vagina, she called for help, and he grabbed her by the throat with both hands and began to choke her. She was unable to breathe and lost consciousness. This gave rise to the charge of attempting to choke her with intent. While he had his finger inside her vagina, he exposed his penis and masturbated. This was the Form 1 matter. 

18The offender was intoxicated by drugs at the time. He had an unfavourable criminal record, including previous convictions for robbery and for inflicting actual bodily harm. However, he was accepted to be remorseful for the subject offences and had good prospects of rehabilitation. Like the present respondent, his sentences were discounted by 25% for early pleas of guilty. 

19The sentencing judge imposed concurrent sentences for the offences, both of which this Court found to be inadequate. The Court also found that the sentencing judge erred in imposing wholly concurrent sentences. With reference to the attempting to choke offence, McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Barr and Bergin JJ agreed, said, ""When that attempt results in the victim becoming unconscious the offence is one of considerable gravity"": [43]. His Honour added, also at [43]: 

""Furthermore, it was entirely inappropriate to provide concurrent sentences for both offences. The initial physical assault and act of intercourse was very serious. However, the subsequent attempted choking of the victim which rendered her unconscious was of a different character and required an identifiable penalty."" 

20The appeal was allowed. On the aggravated sexual assault count the offender was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 years. On the attempting to choke count, taking into account the Form 1 matter, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 11 years, with a non-parole period of 8 years, accumulated upon the previous sentence by 1 year. The aggregate sentence was 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. The appeal was determined before the introduction into the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 of s 68A, and the Chief Judge noted that, it being a Crown appeal, the substituted sentences were ""at the bottom of the available range"": [45]. 

21In R v HQ [2003] NSWCCA 336, the offender was also the stepfather of the victim, who was a 15 year old girl. He pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to strangle her with intent to commit an aggravated indecent assault and one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. He woke the victim in the early hours of the morning and asked if he could touch her. She refused. He brandished a knife, and told her to be quiet or he would kill her brother and cousin (who, presumably, were also asleep in the house). Threatening her with the knife, he took her to a back room. He attempted to touch her breast but she told him to leave her alone. He again threatened to kill her brother and cousin if they awoke. He squeezed her neck with both hands and she had trouble breathing. This was the first count. 

22Still brandishing the knife, he kept asking her to allow him to touch her and she continued to refuse. He again seized her neck with both hands and attempted to strangle her (the second count). She could not breathe, she lost control of her bladder and lapsed into semi-consciousness. While she was in that state, he had penile/vaginal intercourse with her and ejaculated (the third count). 

23The sentencing judge sentenced the offender to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment on the first and third counts, but to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period on the second count which was accumulated by 2 years. The aggregate sentence was 13 years with a non-parole period of 10 years and 3 months. The sentences were arrived at after a discount for his pleas of guilty, but if the sentencing judge quantified the discount that does not appear in the judgments in this Court. 

24His appeal against those sentences was unsuccessful. He had a criminal history which included entries for common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On the other hand, there was taken into account in his favour the fact that he suffered from a depressive illness and faced a lengthy custodial term in strict protection. Spigelman CJ (O'Keefe J agreeing, Greg James J dissenting as to the effective non-parole period) held that the sentences were well within the range of the sentencing judge's discretion and that the partial accumulation of 2 years was entirely appropriate: [45] - [46]. 

25The sentencing judge had imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for the first count which was entirely subsumed within the sentence for the third count, which she had described as objectively more serious: [37]. In rejecting a ground of appeal that her Honour had erred in partly accumulating the sentence for the second count, the Chief Justice said at [39]: 

""The act of sexual intercourse without consent in the particular circumstances of aggravation was a significant offence of itself. It had been preceded by an attempt to strangle with intent to commit the conduct which constituted the second offence. However, the two offences were distinct in their criminality. It would, in my opinion, be rare that sentences for offences related in this way should be entirely concurrent. Her Honour was entitled, within the exercise of her discretion, to determine that each of these distinct offences should contribute separately to the effective punishment, so that one was not entirely subsumed within the other. I can see no error in anything that her Honour said or did in this regard. The sentences imposed do not offend the principle of totality."" 

26In McKechnie v R [2006] NSWCCA 13, the offender was found guilty at trial of attempting to choke with intent to have sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated sexual assault (the circumstance of aggravation being occasioning actual bodily harm). He was sentenced on each count to concurrent terms of imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years. 

27Like the present case, the offender and the victim were strangers. He attacked her at a beach on the north coast of New South Wales. He grabbed her with both hands around her throat, so that she could not breathe, and pushed her down onto a sandbank. He sat on top of her with his hands around her throat. She still could not breathe and feared for her life. When he released his grip on her she attacked his eyes, nose and throat with her hands. She ran, but he grabbed her again and said, ""You've fucking made me really angry now, you bitch."" He pushed her head into the sand so that she could not breathe, he continued to squeeze her throat, and he put his fingers into her vagina and twice inserted his penis. 

28His appeal against conviction was unsuccessful. On sentence, it was noted that he had an extensive criminal record, including convictions for offences of violence, some of which involved choking. He was also on bail at the time of the subject offences. It was also noted that the complainant had suffered substantial injury and emotional harm. The fact that concurrent sentences were passed was not a matter which the Court was called upon to examine. In dismissing the appeal against sentence, Hall J (with whom Mason P and Barr J agreed) concluded that the sentences ""appropriately reflected the seriousness of the offences"" and that they were not manifestly excessive: [89]. 

29Counsel for the respondent, Mr Strickland SC, noted that the Crown did not contend that the sentences in the present case, viewed individually, are manifestly inadequate, and emphasised the discretionary nature of the decision whether sentences should be concurrent or cumulative. He argued that no error had been shown in his Honour's exercise of that discretion here, given the close association between the two offences. He also submitted that a global sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months was not inadequate to reflect the overall criminality of the episode. 

30In particular, he argued that the three cases to which the Crown prosecutor referred do not demonstrate that the global sentence is inadequate. He noted that in each of them the sexual assault charged was the aggravated offence under s 61J of the Crimes Act , whereas the respondent pleaded guilty to the offence in its unaggravated form under s 61I. In MW and HQ , the offender was the stepfather of the victim and, obviously, those offences involved a grave breach of trust. HQ was a particularly serious case, involving two acts of choking and the use of a knife. In all three cases the offender had a less favourable criminal record than the applicant's, including offences of violence. Particularly was this so in McKechnie , and that offender was also on conditional liberty at the time of the offences. 

31On the question of concurrency or accumulation, Mr Strickland also sought to distinguish MW and HQ . The first charge in the present case was attempting to choke or strangle with intent to enable the applicant to commit an indictable offence, and that indictable offence was the sexual assault the subject of the second charge. In MW , the offender had committed an aggravated sexual assault by digital penetration before the attempt to choke the victim. The act of choking occurred while he was attempting penile penetration, and it was with the intent to achieve that penetration that the choking was attempted. In HQ , the offender attempted to strangle the victim the second time with intent to commit aggravated indecent assault, following her continued refusal to allow him to touch her. It was not with the intention of committing the act of sexual intercourse which then ensued. That was a separate act, the subject of the third count. Accordingly, said Mr Strickland, in both those cases there was a measure of distinction between the act of choking and the sexual assault charged which is absent in the present case and which justified some accumulation of sentence. 

32I can see the force of that submission. Of course, whether sentences should be concurrent or cumulative is a matter of discretionary judgment depending on the facts of the case at hand, and this is not the occasion to revisit the familiar line of authority on this topic. However, a passage in the judgment of Howie J (with whom Adams and Price JJ agreed) in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1, 168 A Crim R 41, is pertinent to this case. His Honour said at [27]: 

""... there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both."" 

33Whether two or more offences are part of a single episode of criminality is obviously relevant to the question of concurrence or accumulation, but it is not necessarily determinative of it. As always, the decision turns upon the circumstances of the particular case. Clearly, in the present case the two offences constituted a single episode of criminality. The crucial question, however, is that posed by Howie J in the passage quoted: can the sentence for one of them comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other? I am satisfied that it cannot. The attempt to choke the victim was not a relatively minor act of violence incidental to the sexual offence. It was a serious and dangerous assault, involving a measure of criminality separate from the sexual intercourse. Some accumulation of sentence was called for. 

34In any event, an overall sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 months, while substantial, is insufficient to mark the gravity of these offences. In so saying, I have regard to the fact that the respondent was disinhibited by intoxication of some kind, which is consistent with his having apologised to the victim after the event. Of course, that intoxication provides some explanation for the offences but in no sense excuses them. Allowing for the differences between the cases to which we were referred and the present case, those cases support the proposition that the aggregate sentence here is inadequate. 

35Mr Strickland mounted an argument that this Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene even if error were established. The transcript of the sentence proceedings reveals that, after hearing the submissions of the representatives of the Crown and the respondent (neither of whom appeared in this Court), his Honour announced the sentences which he intended to impose and the fact that they would be concurrent. He then interposed another matter before embarking upon his remarks. Mr Strickland argued that the prosecutor should have taken the opportunity before his Honour commenced his remarks to submit that he risked falling to appealable error if he pursued the course which he had proposed. 

36I see no basis for the exercise of our residual discretion in these circumstances. In the course of submissions to his Honour the prosecutor had argued that the sentences should be partly cumulative. It is clear enough that when his Honour announced the orders he proposed, he had arrived at his decision and there was no basis upon which it was open to the prosecutor to canvas it. It is also clear enough that the reason his Honour did not immediately proceed to sentence was that it was convenient at that point to interpose the other matter. 

37On re-sentence, I have regard to a recent affidavit of the respondent in which he has expressed remorse for these crimes. He has also described the pain which he continues to experience from the injuries he suffered in the assault of 2008 which, he says, leaves him feeling ""very vulnerable and fearful"" within the prison where he is held. The affidavit also discloses that he has been undertaking general education and skills training while in custody. 

38I would allow the appeal. The court's intervention is confined to directing that the sentences be served partly cumulatively, the Crown prosecutor having conceded that the sentence on each count is within range. I would direct that the sentence on the first count, attempting to choke or strangle with intent, should commence 2 years later than the sentence on the second count, that is, on 31 October 2011. The result would be an aggregate sentence of 11 years. Because of the accumulation I would find special circumstances to the limited extent of reducing the non-parole period for the first count to 6 years and 3 months. The effective non-parole period, then, would be 8 years and 3 months, thus preserving the statutory ratio between that period and the aggregate sentence. The respondent would be eligible for release on parole on 30 January 2018. 

39I would propose the following orders: 

(1)Appeal allowed; 

(2)Sentence on the second count confirmed; 

(3)Sentence on the first count quashed and, in lieu, respondent sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months, commencing on 31 October 2011 and expiring on 30 January 2018, and a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months, commencing on 31 January 2018 and expiring on 30 October 2020.

2709151,Luke Nathan Richard BARRETT v R [2011] NSWCCA 213,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA: I agree with Hidden J. 

2HIDDEN J: The applicant, Luke Nathan Richard Barrett, was committed to the District Court for sentence for a series of offences. The first four charges arose from an incident which took place at Parramatta between 17 and 18 October 2006. They were the following: 

1.Aggravated break, enter and steal, an offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years; 

2.Malicious damage, an offence under s 195(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment; 

3.Take and drive a conveyance (deemed larceny), an offence under s 154A(1) of the Crimes Act , also carrying a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment; 

4.Stealing from the person, an offence under s 94 of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment. 

The sentencing judge was asked to take into account on a Form 1, when sentencing for the first charge, an old offence of break, enter and steal which was committed on 10 November 2001. That offence in its unaggravated form carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment: s 112(1) of the Crimes Act . 

3The fifth charge was a further offence of break, enter and steal, committed on 2 March 2006. His Honour was also asked to deal with a driving offence on a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act , but that has no bearing on the present application. 

4His Honour imposed sentences in the reverse order of the numbered charges. On the fifth charge, break, enter and steal, committed on 2 March 2006, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years, commencing on the date sentence was passed, 20 November 2009. On the four charges committed between 17 and 18 October 2006, his Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: 

On the fourth charge, stealing from the person, a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years, commencing on 22 March 2010; 

On the third charge, take and drive conveyance, a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months, commencing on 21 June 2010; 

On the second charge, malicious damage, imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year, also commencing on 21 June 2010; 

On the first charge, aggravated break, enter and steal, taking into account the additional charge on the Form 1, imprisonment for 6 years, comprising a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance of term of 1 years, again commencing on 21 June 2010. 

5The aggregate sentence was imprisonment for 6 years and 7 months, dating from 20 November 2009 and expiring on 20 June 2016, and an effective non-parole period of 5 years and 1 month, expiring on 20 December 2014. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. The only ground of the application is that, when sentencing for the first charge, his Honour did not find special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. 

Facts 

6Given the limited scope of the application, it is unnecessary to set out in detail the facts of the offences. A brief summary is sufficient to expose their nature and gravity. 

7The first four charges relate to a serious criminal episode which extended over about 2 hours on the night of 17 October to the early hours of 18 October 2006. The applicant and a co-offender broke into a building at Parramatta used by the Office of State Revenue. There they stole a variety of items which were the property of that Office, including three palm pilots and five laptops. This was the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, the circumstance of aggravation expressed in the charge being that the applicant was in the company of his co-offender. However, as will be seen, the offence was attended by a number of other circumstances of aggravation set out in s 105A of the Crimes Act . The applicant was armed with an offensive weapon, a knife. A security guard was deprived of his liberty and corporal violence was inflicted upon him. 

8The security guard came upon the offenders while they were in the building but before they had stolen the property. He yelled at them and they ran towards some glass doors. The co-offender shoulder-barged the doors, causing them to crack, but they could not escape. The guard approached them, and the applicant threatened him with a folding knife. He directed the guard to lie face down on the floor, and he was tied up. 

9The applicant searched the guard's pockets and removed two mobile phones, a handheld terminal, some keys, and a building access swipe card. This constituted the offence of stealing from the person. He also seized the guard by the collar and struck him across the back of the head twice, dislodging his glasses and causing him some pain. 

10The applicant tried to use the swipe card to open the doors, without success. The offenders then shoulder-barged another door and kicked at it, causing it to crack and bend out of shape. The damage to the doors, together with some damage to other fixtures apparently caused during their search for items to steal, constituted the charge of malicious damage. 

11On several occasions the applicant asked the guard where a safe and cash could be found, threatening to stab him if he was lying. On one occasion he threatened to kill the guard if he did not disclose how to open a locked cabinet, despite the guard's protests that he did not know how to do so. 

12In the event, the co-offender untied the guard after he said that he would show the offenders how to get out of the building. The guard indicated some doors which could be opened by the use of the swipe card. The applicant carried some of the laptops out of the building and drove the guard's vehicle towards the main doors. This gave rise to the charge of take and drive conveyance, although what the purpose was in doing so is not spelled out in the statement of facts. 

13Sometime thereafter the two offenders left the building. In the meantime the guard had called police, but by the time they arrived the offenders had made good their escape. 

14As I have said, the Form 1 offence was one of break, enter and steal committed on 10 November 2001. In the early evening the applicant broke into a home in West Wollongong and stole a set top box, a gold ring, a Play Station, a computer hard drive and a camera. 

15The fifth charge was a break, enter and steal committed in daylight on 2 March 2006 at Sefton. The applicant forced open the front door of a home and stole a number of items, including a CD player, a DVD player, a VCR, a watch, and some money. 

16The applicant was later linked to the offences by physical evidence. DNA consistent with his was found at the scene of the offences at Parramatta and Sefton, and his fingerprint was found on a flyscreen which had been removed to effect his entry to the home at West Wollongong. On 23 June 2007 he was arrested for other offences in the Australian Capital Territory. It was in the following year, while he was in custody, that he was charged with the present offences. 

17The co-offender was dealt with by another judge. The sentences imposed upon him have no bearing on the present application. 

Subjective case 

18The applicant was 23 years old at the time of the offences the subject of the five charges, all committed in 2006. (At the time of the offence on the Form 1, committed in 2001, he was 18.) He is now 28. He has a bad criminal record, commencing in Children's Courts in 1999, the year he turned 16. There are numerous entries thereafter, primarily for offences of dishonesty, including break, enter and steal and the unlawful use of motor vehicles. Apart from some charges dealt with in Wollongong District Court in 2006, there are no entries for violence. The disposition of those charges was the subject of a Crown appeal, to which I shall refer in a moment. He has been sentenced to terms of imprisonment on several occasions. 

19The Crown appeal related to an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal and three charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, committed in the early morning of 1 January 2005. The applicant broke into a home in Wollongong, triggering an alarm which was heard by the three occupants of the home, who were nearby. They returned to the house and intercepted the applicant. In the course of his trying to escape, he assaulted each of them, as well as a neighbour who came to their assistance. The appeal was allowed in part, and the effect of this Court's order was an aggregate term of imprisonment for 4 years and 7 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 7 months: R v Barrett [2006] NSWCCA 348. 

20The applicant was on parole in respect of those sentences in October 2006, when the offences the subject of the first four charges were committed. At that time he was also subject to suspended sentences imposed by the Drug Court in August 2006 for an offence of break, enter and steal and related offences. I might add that he was subject to that parole and to those suspended sentences when he committed the offences which led to his arrest in the Australian Capital Territory in June 2007. There he was dealt with for a variety of offences, mainly of dishonesty, which included two counts of burglary with intent to steal. 

21While he was in custody his parole was revoked, and he was required to serve a balance of term expiring on 22 December 2010. As I have said, the sentences the subject of this application commenced on 20 November 2009, so that roughly 13 months of his aggregate sentence has been served concurrently with that balance of term. Full time custodial sentences were also imposed by the Drug Court, but they had expired before the present sentences were passed. 

22The aggregate sentence imposed for the offences in the Australian Capital Territory was imprisonment for 15 months, dating from the date of his arrest there, 23 June 2007. However, because of the revocation of his parole in this State, the applicant remained in custody after that aggregate sentence expired. Accordingly, he has been in continuous custody since 23 July 2007. Upon the expiry of the effective non-parole period imposed in respect of the present sentences on 20 December 2014, he would have been in custody for a little under 7 years and 5 months. He would then be eligible for release on parole for 18 months. 

23He had a very dysfunctional upbringing. His parents separated when he was an infant. Thereafter he had little contact with his father and he was brought up by his mother. She had several subsequent partners, who were violent towards her and one of whom, he alleged, abused him physically and sexually. 

24He was taken into care by the Department of Community Services at the age of 11, and he also alleged that an officer of that Department sexually abused him when he was 12 or 13 years old. He spent his teenage years living on the streets, in refuges or juvenile institutions. Although he completed year 10 at school, he is only semi-literate. He has had no more than limited, unskilled employment. He has an extensive history of abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs, commencing when he was 9 years old. 

25His mother committed suicide in 2002, just before he turned 18. After her death he began to renew his relationship with his father, but his father died of a heart attack in 2005. His only sibling is his younger brother, who lives in the ACT. There were before his Honour a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report, from which it appeared that he might benefit from drug and alcohol treatment, anger management and psychological counselling generally. 

The application 

26As noted above, his Honour passed fixed terms of imprisonment on all the charges but the first, in respect of which he sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. That sentence maintained the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. 

27The only ground of the application is that his Honour erred in failing to find, or to adequately consider, whether there were special circumstances justifying a departure from that statutory proportion. This issue had been raised in submissions on sentence on the basis that, if there were to be accumulation of sentences, the period of parole eligibility might be disproportionate to the total period the applicant would be required to serve in custody. Reference was made to R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58 and R v Pollock (1993) 67 A Crim R 166. In his remarks his Honour said, without elaboration, that he did not find special circumstances. 

28His Honour expressed no finding about the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation but, given his criminal history, they could fairly have been seen as bleak. Nevertheless, the accumulation of sentences was a significant factor on the issue of special circumstances. What called for consideration was not just the measure of accumulation within the sentences which his Honour passed, but also the measure of the accumulation of those sentences upon the term he was already serving. The effect of the sentences his Honour passed, as I have said, was an aggregate term of 6 years and 7 months with an effective non-parole period of 5 years and 1 month. The proportion of that non-parole period to the aggregate sentence is roughly 77%. When regard is had to the whole period of continuous custody, in round figures 7 years and 5 months, and the period of parole eligibility of 18 months, the proportion is roughly 83%. 

29It is well established that accumulation of sentence, whether by reference to sentences passed on one occasion or to a sentence which the offender is already serving, is a basis for a finding of special circumstances. Equally, it is well established that whether special circumstances are found for that reason is a matter for judgment in each case. Certainly, there is not a general requirement that the proportion between effective non-parole period and aggregate sentence should not exceed 75%. Nevertheless, where it does, one would expect the sentencing judge to articulate his or her reasons for doing so and, in the absence of such reasons, the inference might be drawn that the practical effect of the accumulation was overlooked: R v Nightingale [2005] NSWCCA 147, per Tobias JA (with whom Buddin and Hall JJ agreed) at [39] - [46]. 

30That inference is available here. Furthermore, the case raises another issue, although it is one which does not appear to have been raised before his Honour. There is authority that the risk of institutionalisation might be a basis for a finding of special circumstances. A number of cases concerned with this issue were cited by Fullerton J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) in Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 at [24]. Among those cases was R v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5, 118 A Crim R 131, decided by a bench comprising Simpson and Dowd JJ. It is unnecessary to recite the facts of that case but, significantly for present purposes, on re-sentence the court found special circumstances largely because of the degree of institutionalisation of that offender: see the leading judgment of Dowd J at [66] - [67], Simpson J agreeing at [9]. 

31In Jackson , at [25], Fullerton J expressed the approach of the court in Lemene , and the principle underlying it, in this way: 

"" The adjustment in the statutory ratio was made in that case expressly to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender who had spent little time out of an institution over the course of his adult life having suffered social, educational, psychological and occupational disadvantages in his youth. Her honour's approach, however, underscores the fact that a risk of institutionalisation, even in the face of entrenched recidivism and serious reoffending, is a factor a sentencing court may regard as a sufficiently special circumstance to warrant an adjustment to the statutory ratio under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ."" 

(In that passage Fullerton J appears to have attributed to Simpson J observations which, in fact, are to be found in the judgment of Dowd J.) 



32In my view, the present case called for that approach. The applicant's criminal history discloses that from 2002 until his present period of custody, commencing in 2007, he had been in and out of gaol. In 2002 and in each of the ensuing years he was sentenced to prison terms, and on two occasions he was returned to custody following the revocation of a parole order. As I have said, his present custodial situation is such that by the time he next becomes eligible for release on parole he will have spent almost 7 years in prison. 

33No doubt, the genesis of his pattern of offending is his seriously disadvantaged upbringing. By the time he is eligible for parole he will be in his 30's. The stage must be approaching when prison is the only environment in which he can function. Supervision and the sanction of parole when he is next released may be the last chance to break the cycle he has been in since his youth. The author of a pre-sentence report found him to be suitable for a medium to high level of intervention by the Probation and Parole Service. 

34In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the process of sentencing the applicant miscarried and that this court should intervene. If the applicant were released when he becomes eligible for parole, he would be at conditional liberty for 18 months. That is a significant period but, given his background and the length of time he would by then have been in custody, I am satisfied that a longer period would serve his interest and that of the community. That said, any reduction of his effective non-parole period must take account of the need for that period to be sufficient to reflect his criminality. 

35In the event of re-sentence, affidavits of the applicant and his solicitor were read. They disclose that, while in custody, the applicant has pursued counselling for a variety of problems arising from his background, including his drug and alcohol addiction. He has established contact with his brother and a girlfriend, both of whom are supportive of him. He has a 9 year old daughter, who is cared for by his brother. He deposes that on his release he hopes to undergo residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation and to be allowed to live in the ACT, where his brother is. 

36His criminality is such that only a relatively modest reduction of the effective non-parole period could be justified. I would reduce it by 9 months, yielding a period of parole eligibility of 2 years and 3 months. The proportion of that period to the aggregate sentence, having regard to the whole period of continuous custody, is about 25%. I would achieve that result by reducing the non-parole period on the first charge from 4 years to 3 years and 9 months. 

37I would propose the following orders: 


Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. 

The sentences on the second, third, fourth and fifth charges are confirmed. 

The sentence on the first charge, aggravated break, enter and steal, is quashed. In lieu, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 21 June 2010 and expiring on the 20 March 2014, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 21 March 2014 and expiring on 20 June 2016.

2709155,Kalache v R [2011] NSWCCA 210,"Judgment 

1ALLSOP P: I have read the reasons of Simpson J and Buddin J. I agree with the orders proposed by Buddin J. Given the disagreement between them I should express my own reasons for coming to the view that I have. I need only be brief, given the comprehensive discussion of the issues by my colleagues. 

2The concept of special circumstances is one derived from the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 44(2) (and its predecessor, the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW), s 5(2)). It assists in informing the appropriate ratio between the non-parole and parole periods in any given case. As such, it affects the justice and appropriateness of the overall sentence: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 at 62-63 and Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 623-624 [45]-[49] and it bears upon an important element and purpose of the sentencing process, rehabilitation: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 3A(d); Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476 and The Queen v Shrestha [1991] HCA 26; 173 CLR 48 at 69. 

3It is true that there was little explicit material here as to the prospects of rehabilitation. The various offences revealed a propensity for dishonesty, the last including a disregard for the administration of justice. There was no foundation to conclude, however, (and neither sentencing judge did) that rehabilitation was so unlikely as to be a concept legitimately to be viewed as foreign to the sentencing process. 

4As the reasons of Buddin J make clear, the failure of a sentencing judge to address the question of special circumstances in the process of cumulation may, and in all likelihood will, reveal error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 

5As I appreciate it, the disagreement between Simpson J and Buddin J is not one as to principle but it is as to the reading of the reasons of, in particular, Woods DCJ. As Howie AJ said in Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 at [24]-[25], the reasons for sentence in this context are crucial. 

6The tasks of the sentencing judges here were difficult. There were a series of offences, all deserving of sentences of imprisonment. No complaint is made about any individual sentence. The nature of the reference by Woods DCJ to special circumstances, the sentences imposed by him and the lack of reference to a consideration of the overall effect of the sentences on the relationship between non-parole and parole periods lead me to agree with Buddin J that his Honour failed to give consideration to the assessment of an overall appropriate sentence in the light of the applicant's history of incarceration. 

7I have difficulty with concluding that Bennett DCJ committed any error given how the sentencing submissions before him appear to have been approached by the parties. Bennett DCJ was faced with a serious offence (attempt to pervert the course of justice), even if at the lower end of the range of seriousness for the crime. 

8In these circumstances, I agree with Buddin J that intervention is warranted by the error of Woods DCJ. I agree with the sentence proposed by Buddin J. No lesser non-parole period is warranted. The parole period vindicates, to the limited extent possible, the purpose of rehabilitation through earlier release and supervision. 
9SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences consecutively imposed upon him on 22 June 2009 and 21 June 2010 in the District Court by, respectively, Woods DCJ and Bennett DCJ. 

10The sole issue raised by the application concerns the structure of the total term of the sentences following their accumulation. The applicant's contention is that he is subject to an overall term of imprisonment that has an inappropriate emphasis on the non-parole period, at the expense of the period of the sentence during which he would be eligible for release on parole. It is not contended that any of the individual sentences is manifestly excessive or otherwise attended by error. The argument takes into account sentences earlier imposed on the applicant, on two occasions, that are not the subject of complaint. 

11The contention is based upon s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") which relevantly provides: 

""(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 

(2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision)."" 

In other words, absent special circumstances, a non-parole period is not to be less than 75 percent of the total sentence. 

12Notwithstanding s 44, by s 45 a sentencing court may decline to set a non-parole period (for reasons there specified) and instead set a fixed term. 




The Applicant's Sentencing History 

13It is necessary to set out the applicant's sentencing history, including sentences not the subject of the application. The applicant has in fact been sentenced on four separate occasions, and has been in continuous custody since 26 June 2008. His sentencing history is as follows: 

(i) On 26 August 2008 he was sentenced in the Local Court (in respect of offences of possessing or using a prohibited weapon, and possessing or attempting to possess a prescribed restricted substance) to two concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment of 2 months, commencing on 26 June 2008 and expiring on 25 August 2008; 

(ii) on 14 November 2008, he was sentenced by Woods DCJ (following jury conviction, in respect of one count of conspiracy to defraud and one of money laundering, committed in February and July 2001) to: 


imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years, commencing on 26 August 2008 (i.e. at the expiration of the August 2008 sentences) and expiring on 25 August 2010; 
imprisonment for 2 years and 2 months, commencing on 26 February 2009 and expiring on 25 April 2011, with a non-parole period of 18 months, expiring on 25 August 2010. (This sentence was partially accumulated on the previous sentence). 

The aggregate sentence conformed to the s 44(2) proportions; 

(iii) on 22 June 2009, he was again sentenced by Woods DCJ (following jury conviction of one count of conspiracy to defraud and three counts of money laundering, committed in 2004) to: 


three concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for 2 years, commencing on 25 August 2010 (i.e. at the expiration of the non-parole period of the November 2008 sentence) and expiring on 24 August 2012; 
Imprisonment for 3 years and 4 months, commencing on 25 April 2011 and expiring on 24 August 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months expiring on 24 August 2013. (This sentence was partially accumulated on the concurrent terms). The second sentence incorporated a slight variation from the s 44(2) proportions, which if applied, would have yielded a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, on a head sentence of 3 years and 4 months. The variation restored, to the aggregate sentence, the s 44(2) proportion. But when taken in conjunction with the August and November 2008 sentences, the non-parole period represented 86 percent of the total of the sentences to that date imposed; 

(iv) on 21 June 2010, he was sentenced by Bennett DCJ (following conviction after trial by judge alone, of an offence of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, committed on 19 June 2008) to: 


imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 25 June 2013 and expiring on 24 June 2014, with a non-parole period of 9 months expiring on 24 March 2014. (This sentence was partially accumulated on the previous sentences). The sentence conformed to the s 44(2) proportions. When taken in conjunction with all earlier sentences, the non-parole period represents 93 percent of the total of the sentences imposed.

15Since no complaint is made about any of the individual sentences imposed, it is unnecessary to go into detail about the nature of the offences. It is sufficient to say that the conspiracy offences involved the applicant agreeing with other participants in a scheme by which financial institutions were fraudulently induced to advance to purported borrowers sums in excess of the value of properties against which the funds were lent; the money laundering offences involved the disposition of the funds so obtained. Woods DCJ remarked that the 2001 and 2004 offences were essentially similar. (It is only the sentences imposed in respect of the 2004 offences that are the subject of this application.) 

16The pervert the course of justice offence was committed on 19 June 2008, by the applicant asking a person who was to be a Crown witness in the prosecution of the 2004 offences to make a false statement concerning the evidence he could give. Bennett DCJ found the offence to be ""at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness"". (AB 62) 

17There is little material of a personal nature concerning the applicant revealed in any of the remarks on sentence. He was born in January 1970, and was 31 at the time of the commission of the first (2001) set of conspiracy and fraud offences; 34 at the time of the second set, and 38 at the time of the pervert the course of justice offence. He is now 41 years of age, and will, when eligible for release on parole, be 44. 

18It appears that on only one occasion during this course of sentencing was any mention made of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. In sentencing the applicant in 2009, Woods DCJ said: 

""I find special circumstances for varying the normal relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period in count 1, consisting in the structure of the sentences to be imposed overall."" 

19His Honour therefore varied the statutory proportion. As I have said above, the effect of the variation of the statutory provisions in one sentence was to restore the statutory proportion of the aggregate sentence. 

20Section 44(2) does not specify the bases upon which the proportions stated in the subsection may be varied. However, commonly, two bases are seen. The first concerns rehabilitation. A non-parole period may be reduced in order to allow the offender an extended period of time under supervision on parole. The second arises when cumulative sentences are being imposed. If the statutory proportions are to be retained in the overall sentence, as distinct from the individual sentences, it is sometimes necessary to vary the proportions of the non-parole and parole periods in the individual sentences in order to achieve that result. That is exactly what Woods DCJ did, and that I take it, is what he meant by the somewhat elliptical remark, extracted above. 

21It is to be noted of s 44, that while imposing a prohibition (reversible) on the imposition of a sentence in which the non-parole period is less than 75 percent of the overall sentence, there is no corresponding prohibition on fixing a sentence in which the non-parole period exceeds that proportion. Nor is any reason required to be given where that is done. However, this Court has held, on more than one occasion, that a sentencing court which decides to take that course would be well advised to explain why it does so: see, for example, Wakefield v R [2010] NSWCCA 12. This is to avoid an inference that the structure of the sentences arose by oversight: R v Henry [2004] NSWCCA 306; Wakefield . 

22As is apparent from what I have said above, on the single occasion where the statutory proportions were varied in the applicant's favour, some explanation was given. The applicant does not complain of the way in which the individual sentences were structured; what he complains of is that, by the progressive accumulation of sentences, the sentences became more and more skewed in favour of the non-parole period, at the expense of the parole period. By the time Bennett DCJ imposed his sentence, the proportion (taking into account all sentences dating back to the 2008 Local Court sentences) was 93 percent of the overall sentence. 

23As I have said, the argument advanced on behalf of the applicant is that the non-parole period should be reduced in order to lengthen the period in which he is eligible for release on parole, in order to accommodate his need for rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. The sentences imposed by Woods DCJ in 2009 and Bennett DCJ in 2010 ought to have taken into account the increasing disparity between the statutory proportion, and the proportions the sentences were accumulating 

24One difficulty with the argument is the sparsity of material available to establish any need for rehabilitation. What there is, emerging from the various Remarks on Sentence, is, essentially, limited to the following. The applicant came to Australia at the age of 6 (from where is not stated), is married and has three children. He has, apart from the offences mentioned in these reasons, limited criminal record, although his record includes an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm for which, in 1993, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a minimum term of 4 years, with an additional term of 18 months. (The severity of the sentence, which was upheld on appeal, is an indicator of the gravity of the offence). 

25This judgment is not concerned with the length of any of the individual sentences imposed. It is directed solely to the complaint made, that the total term commencing with the sentences of 2 months commencing on 26 June 2008 resulted in a total term of imprisonment in which the non-parole period is disproportionate and excessive. 

26I cannot accept that the evidence establishes the proposition for which the applicant contends. It is, I accept, highly unusual to see an accumulation of sentences that results in an overall sentence bearing the proportions that this accumulation of sentences does. However, having regard to the applicant's criminality, I am unable to see that any lesser non-parole period would be adequate. The only means of achieving a more conventional proportion would be by extending the head sentence, a course that is expressly available under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912; but that is a power that is rarely exercised, and one that is not realistically available in this application. I bear in mind that, although it would have been unusual, given the length of the sentences it would have been open to any of the judges to impose a fixed term of imprisonment - had either done so, he would also have been obliged to explain his reasons for doing so. 

27I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal. 

28BUDDIN J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Simpson J in draft. Regrettably, I am unable to agree with her Honour. 

29As Simpson J points out, the combined effect of the sentences imposed upon the applicant by Woods DCJ on 22 June 2009 and by Bennett DCJ, is that the non-parole period which the applicant is serving represents just over 93% of the total term. The further consequence is that whereas the applicant was eligible, as a result of the sentences imposed by Woods DCJ to a parole period of 12 months, the overall period by reason of the sentence imposed by Bennett DCJ is now one of just 5 months. Furthermore, by the time the applicant becomes eligible to be released on parole he will have spent a total of 5 years and 9 months in continuous custody. 

30As Simpson J has also observed, Woods DCJ made a finding of ""special circumstances"" albeit in somewhat elliptical terms. The effect of that finding was to produce an overall sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years for the offences in respect of which the applicant then stood for sentence. In other words, the sentences were structured in such a fashion as to produce a non-parole period which represented 75% of the overall term for that group of offences. However, those sentences were ordered to be served cumulatively upon two pre-existing sentences, a feature of the case to which Woods DCJ did not refer when determining the sentences in question. On the other hand, Bennett DCJ made no reference at all to the question of ""special circumstances"" and the non-parole period which his Honour imposed represented 75% of the overall term of the sentence which his Honour imposed. 

31The sentencing of offenders for multiple offences produces particular challenges. In Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 the High Court said: 

The totality principle is a recognised principle of sentencing formulated to assist a court when sentencing an offender for a number of offences. It is described succinctly in Thomas, Principles of Sentencing , 2nd ed (1979), pp 56-7 as follows (omitting references): 

The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'. The principle has been stated many times in various forms: ' when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong '; 'when ... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences'. 

See also Ruby, Sentencing , 3 rd ed. (1987), pp. 38-41. Where the principle falls to the applied in relation to sentences of imprisonment imposed by a single sentencing court, an appropriate result may be achieved either by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed. Where practicable, the former is to be preferred. [at 62-3] (emphasis added) 

32In Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said: 

To an offender, the only relevant question may be ""how long"", and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well as, of course, as questions of totality. [at para 45] 

33See also Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616. 
34A sentencing judge is bound to consider the question of ""special circumstances"" in accordance with the terms of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . The requirement to do so, particularly where it is also necessary to accommodate the principles of totality, is an issue with which this Court has had to grapple on a number of occasions in recent years. 

35In Simpson v R (1992) 61 A Crim R 58, a number of sentences were imposed upon an offender who was, like the present applicant, serving a sentence at the time. Hunt CJ at CL, with the concurrence of the other members of the court, said: 

The principal objection taken on behalf of the applicant is to the gross disproportion between the total minimum term of four and a half years which he has to serve and the only effective additional term of three months. He says that, although the three months additional term represents what may be called the ""usual"" proportion of one-third of the last minimum term imposed ( Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW), s 5), it represents only just over 5 percent of the total sentences of the two counts which he is serving (that is, total sentences of four years and nine months). 

... 

The judge did not, however, give any consideration to whether special circumstances were established by the extraordinary disproportion - created by the sentences which he was imposing simply by adhering to the formula provided by s 5(2) - between the total minimum term of four and a half years and the effective additional term of three months. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the judge made an error in the exercise of his sentencing discretion. 

In my view, the sentence should be restructured so as to produce the result that the additional term is one-third of the total minimum term, but maintaining the present total sentences of the two courts of four years and nine months. [At pp 60-62] 

36In Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 an effective sentence of 7 years 4 months and 22 days imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years 8 months and 10 days was imposed. Howie AJ, with whom the other members of the court concurred, said: 

His Honour found that there were special circumstances and applied that finding to reduce each of the non-parole periods that he specified for the individual sentences. ... 

The overall non-parole period imposed by ... was, on my calculation, 77 per cent of the overall head sentence. For my part I do not understand why a judge would find special circumstances on each separate offence, yet impose a sentence on overall basis where the non-parole period is more than 75 per cent of the total sentence. This Court has on more than one occasion been troubled by applications for leave to appeal in similar situations. Sometimes the Court has upheld the appeal and sometimes it has been dismissed. The individual decisions depend upon what can be gleaned of the Judge's intention from the sentencing remarks. 

... 

Those remarks indicate to me that his Honour intended a finding of special circumstances to apply to the overall period of custody that the applicant was required to serve as a result of the five offences he had committed. 

However, not only did his Honour's finding of special circumstances not translate into a reduction of the overall non-parole period imposed by him, but also, when consideration is given to the overall sentence he is to serve as a result of the sentences imposed by both Judges, the overall non-parole period is about 80 percent of the total sentence. I do not believe that [the sentencing judge] intended this result. As I have indicated the Crown fairly conceded the point. [at paras 23-26] 

37Those cases provide illustrations of the two broad categories of case in respect of which the Court has seen fit to intervene. The first category concerns a situation in which the sentencing judge has failed to address the issue of ""special circumstances"". The second category concerns a situation in which the sentencing judge has made a finding of ""special circumstances"", but has then failed to give effect to that finding in structuring the overall sentencing outcome. There are many other such instances. See R v Close (1993) 31 NSWLR 743; R v Clissold [2002] NSWCCA 356; R v Lyndon [2003] NSWCCA 152; R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215; R v Reicher [2003] NSWCCA 300; R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86; R v Henry [2004] NSWCCA 306; R v Jammeh [2004] NSWCCA 327; R v Attard [2004] NSWCCA 376; R v Ibrahim [2005] NSWCCA 43; R v Swan [2005] NSWCCA 252; Fina'i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134; Perry v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 351; (2006) 166 A Crim R 383; Buadromo v R [2007] NSWCCA 43; GAC v The Queen; WC v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 287; (2007) 178 A Crim R 1; Dunn v R [2007] NSWCCA 312; Diesing v R [2007] NSWCCA 326; MAJW v R [2009] NSWCCA 255; Flynn v R [2010] NSWCCA 171; Briggs v R [2010] NSWCCA 250; Thorpe v R [2010] NSWCCA 261; Wakefield v R [2010] NSWCCA 12; IS v R [2011] NSWCCA 142; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118. 

38However, there have been instances in which this Court has not intervened in circumstances in which the non-parole period has exceeded 75% of the overall term. See, for example, Musgrove v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 21; (2007) 167 A Crim R 424; Trindall v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 119; (2007) 171 A Crim R 87. 

39What is significant about each of those decisions however is that there was no question of inadvertence on the part of the sentencing judge because in each case the judge intended to produce the particular sentencing outcome which was imposed. 

40Moreover, in each of those cases the actual period of time which the offender was anticipated to spend on parole was to be measured in years rather than in months. 

41In that context it may be observed that in Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7, RA Hulme J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said 

This brings me to the point that the focus should not be solely upon the percentage proportions that the non-parole and parole periods bear to the total term. The actual periods involved are equally, and probably more, important. In the present case the judge's sentencing order allows for a potential period on parole of 2 years 6 months. There was no evidence before the judge that required a conclusion that this was insufficient to meet the purposes for which the judge found special circumstances. [at para 41] 

42Furthermore, in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, Spigelman CJ said, with the concurrence of the other members of the court: 

The length of the non-parole period remains, however, of potential significance. Indeed, the requirements of rehabilitation would be best computed in terms of a period of linear time, not in terms of a fixed percentage of a head sentence. The desirability of a longer than computed period of supervision will be an appropriate approach in many cases. It is not, however, the only perspective. [at para 58] 

43The decisions to which I have referred, in my view, lend considerable support to the applicant's claim that both sentencing judges have fallen into error. As I have said, Woods DCJ found ""special circumstances"" on account of the need to accumulate the sentences with which he was concerned in June 2009, but then failed to consider the impact of those sentences upon the applicant's overall custodial circumstances. In my view, this failure constituted an error. Furthermore as I have also said, Judge Bennett failed to refer to the question of ""special circumstances"" at all. The explanation for his Honour's failure to do so may lie in the fact that the parties at first instance apparently did not bring the matter to his Honour's attention. The consequence, in my view, is that his Honour simply overlooked the matter and thereby compounded the error into which Woods DCJ had fallen. That said, I accept that the challenge facing Bennett DCJ was particularly stark given that he was imposing a sentence of relatively short duration in respect of a single offence against the background of the pre-existing sentences which were described by Simpson J. 

44Putting the matter another way, neither judge appears to have undertaken the task of which the High Court spoke in Mill (supra) of having a ""last look at the total [sentence] just to see whether it looks wrong"". In my view, a sentence in which the period of eligibility for release on parole is just 5 months, against an overall non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months in custody, is unable to withstand that kind of analysis. 

45Moreover, an important purpose of sentencing is the rehabilitation of offenders. The community has a profound interest in ensuring that that objective is pursued. It is very difficult to see how that objective is likely to be achieved should the sentencing outcome in the present case be permitted to stand. I accept that the evidence concerning the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation was very limited. Nonetheless, his prospects had not evaporated to the point at which it could be said that he was beyond redemption. The applicant's history did not, for example, suggest that he was a career criminal who had continued to offend whilst on parole. Nor did either of the sentencing judges make a finding of that kind. 

46For those reasons I am of the view that the Court should intervene and proceed to re-sentence the applicant. I see no warrant for interfering with the effective total head sentence of 6 years and 2 months imprisonment. I propose however that the effective non-parole period should be reduced to one of 5 years. I appreciate that the proportion which the non-parole period bears to the head sentence is still in excess of 75 percent, but in my view that period in custody is the minimum period which is required in all the circumstances. It will be necessary to restructure some aspects of the sentences which were imposed in the District Court in order to give effect to the outcome which I have foreshadowed. I should also observe that in arriving at that outcome, I have borne steadily in mind the various principles to which I referred at the outset of these reasons. In my view, the simplest way in which to achieve the proposed outcome is to alter only the sentence imposed by Woods DCJ in respect of the offence of conspiracy to defraud and leave the other sentences intact. The reason why various of the sentences are fixed terms is because of the manner in which the sentence which is now last in time is structured. 

47I propose the following orders: 

1 Grant leave to appeal. 

2 Allow the appeals. 

3 Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and in substitution therefor impose the following sentences: 

(a) for the offence of perverting the course of justice, sentence the applicant to a fixed term of 9 months to commence on 25 August 2010 and to expire on 25 May 2011; 

(b) for each of the three offences of money laundering, sentence the applicant to concurrent fixed terms of 2 years to commence on 25 February 2011 and to expire on 25 February 2013; 

(c) for the offence of conspiracy to defraud, sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months to commence on 25 October 2011 and to expire on 24 June 2013 with a total term of 2 years and 10 months to expire on 24 August 2014. 

4 The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 24 June 2013.

2709156,Rae v R [2011] NSWCCA 211,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Johnson J. 

2HIDDEN J : I agree with Johnson J. 

3JOHNSON J : The Applicant, Toni Maria Rae, seeks leave to appeal with respect to a sentence imposed in the District Court on 23 August 2010 for a significant drug supply offence. 

4The Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge that, on 25 September 2009, at Edgecliff, she did knowingly take part in the supply of an amount of a prohibited drug, namely 1,000 tablets purported to be MDMA (ecstasy), being an amount not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug. This is an offence contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

5The Applicant was sentenced by Garling DCJ to a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 8 October 2009 and expiring on 7 April 2013, with a balance of term of two years commencing on 8 April 2013 and expiring on 7 April 2015. 

Grounds of Appeal 

6The Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

(a) Ground 1 - the sentence imposed upon the Applicant's co-offender, Adel Abhari, gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the Applicant. 

(b) Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence committed by the Applicant. 
 
Facts of Offence 

7A detailed statement of agreed facts was tendered before Garling DCJ. The Applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. As will be seen, this is an important point of distinction as between the sentence imposed on 17 December 2010 by Hosking SC DCJ upon the Applicant's co-offender, Adel Abhari. 

8Garling DCJ found the following facts (ROS1-4, 23 August 2010): 

""The facts which I have been supplied with are lengthy and they form part of exhibit A. The police set up an operation. On 23 September 2009 an undercover operative met with the offender. During the meeting the undercover operative indicated he wanted 1,000 MDMA tablets, or ecstasy. The offender told the undercover police operative that she would be willing to supply in lots of 1,000 tablets. She said they would cost thirteen dollars. The cost of the tablets could come down if the relationship continued. There were certain discussions about money she felt was owing to her. That meeting was subject to physical surveillance and the conversations were recorded. 

On 24 September she contacted the undercover police officer and said she was able to supply 1,000 ecstasy tablets. She arranged to meet the undercover police operative the following day to provide samples of the tablets. The police then intercepted a text message from the offender to a co-offender, Abhari, which bears some importance in that there is a third person involved in all this, a person quaintly named Peter Pan who appears to be the person actually supplying the drugs to Abhari and then to the offender. 

On 25 September the offender spoke to Abhari. They discussed the availability of the 1,000 ecstasy tablets and she was told there were plenty of tablets available. They were discussing ways in which the transaction could be carried out, and she confirmed that she would pay eight dollars per tablet. She said she was willing to drop the price to the customer to twelve dollars a tablet, which would have given a profit of four dollars per tablet. 

On 25 September they met at a cafe and there was a discussion re the supply. The offender stated that her supplier had twenty-five bags, each containing 1,000 tablets. She stated that her supplier could supply tablets with different stamps, et cetera. During the meeting she telephoned Abhari asking for an estimate as to how long the deal would take to complete. A short time later she was observed to enter premises at Darling Point and then she came out with Abhari. They followed the car to Brighton-Le-Sands. There was then a text message sent by Abhari to the offender, again indicating some of the conditions about when the drugs would be available and again nominating Peter Pan as the person who would be supplying them. The police say the message related to Abhari supplying Rae with ecstasy tablets and the leader of the syndicate is referred to as Peter Pan. 

There were more telephone conversations recorded and more text 
messages. On 29 September a further text message was sent by Abhari to the offender about the supply and about the agreement to supply the undercover police operative with 1,000 ecstasy tablets, to be delivered in a container of fish oil tablets. On the same day there were further telephone calls, and indeed I think it was Abhari who had to deposit the rego papers and car keys of his car, which appears to be a BMW, to enable him to get the drugs. There was then a telephone call from Abhari to Rae. He says, 

'I will come, jump in the cab. He will follow me to give it to you. Get the bag, get back in the cab, go to your street and fix you up there. You will get in the cab' -- 

Abhari said: 

'He will get in the cab, he will meet me in your street, straight from here, straight there. I will see you, give it to you, I will get the bag, go to your place or he will come down and do it himself.' 

He was worried it was a rip. A little later on the same day she was again telephoned. He said he was looking for a cab. She said the undercover police operative would be there in twenty minutes and she directed him to a place near New South Head Road, Edgecliff. He asked how they were going to deal. She said 'jump out in the middle of the street, bang bang'. She said she was in her car. Abhari said 'when you get here come over, I will look out for you and when you come into the street past the first car park, turn into there'. He said he was jumping in the cab. She was going to the supermarket to get an appropriate bag. Police were conducting surveillance. 

At about 3.50 on the same day a taxi was observed to enter this area. Abhari exited the taxi, met the offender, they walked to the undercover police operative's car parked nearby. She placed a green-coloured enviro bag containing a newspaper in the car boot, Abhari placed the blue, red and white-coloured Lonsdale brand bag in the car boot, the undercover police operative opened the bag and saw it contained a plastic container. Located within the container was an amount of powder and a white plastic bag which also contained white powder. The undercover police operative handed Abhari a green-coloured enviro bag which contained $12,000 in Australian currency. He then ran to the taxi and police followed the taxi. 

A short time later police met with the undercover police operative and got the drugs. In the container was an amount of powder. Located within the powder was a plastic bag which contained 249.2 grams of white powder. A little later on the same day police intercepted a call between the undercover police officer and the offender. He told her he had only received the powder, 'I only got powder nothing else'. Abhari could be heard in the background and it seems he formed the opinion that he had provided the wrong drugs and wrong bag. There was then a discussion about what was contained in the bag and Abhari says, 

'It is the coke for the Asians. It was to go to the Asians. They are going to go off their head. Tell them I will call you back, I will call you back.' 

The powder was subsequently analysed and contained no prohibited drug. 

On 8 October a search warrant was executed. The offender was located within a unit. The mobile phone with the number which had been used was confirmed as hers. It was located in the premises. She declined to participate in a record of interview and notes were found which indicated she was clearly involved in this dealing. Mr Abhari has been charged."" 

9The Applicant remained in continuous custody from 8 October 2009 and the sentence was backdated to that date. 

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances 

10The Applicant was born in New Zealand in February 1972. She was 37 years' old at the time of the offence and 38 years at the time of sentence. 

11The Applicant's criminal history contains one entry. On 23 July 2008, she was sentenced at the Downing Centre Local Court for an offence of possess prohibited drug and received a six-month bond under s.10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

12A report dated 11 August 2010 prepared by Michelle Player, clinical psychologist, was tendered in the defence case on sentence. The sentencing Judge extracted the Applicant's personal history from that report. 

13After leaving school, she was employed in the hospitality industry for many years. She managed a massage parlour in Auckland for about two years from 1999 and came to Australia in about 2001, where she worked thereafter as a sex worker and in the escort industry. 

14His Honour accepted that the Applicant had abused methylamphetamine on a daily basis over an eight-year period and that some of the Applicant's drug usage related to her area of work. His Honour observed that the Applicant had gone into gaol with ""a very significant drug problem"" and that the Applicant had availed herself of a drug and alcohol program in custody and required further assistance. 

Some Other Findings on Sentence 

15The Applicant was allowed a 25% discount for her early plea of guilty to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea. Further, his Honour observed that the Applicant had ""expressed some remorse"" . 

16The sentencing Judge found ""special circumstances"" by reference to the Applicant's need for ongoing assistance with her drug problem and her good prospects of rehabilitation in that respect, together with the fact that this was her first term of imprisonment. 

Findings Concerning Objective Seriousness of the Offence 

17To place in context the findings concerning the objective seriousness of the Applicant's offence, it is helpful to refer to submissions made for the Crown and the Applicant at the sentencing hearing in the District Court on 20 August 2010. 

18As mentioned earlier, the only evidence before his Honour was the statement of agreed facts together with the report of Ms Player. The Applicant did not give evidence on sentence. 

19Counsel for the Applicant submitted that, in terms of objective seriousness, this offence was ""in the low end of the range for offences of this type"" . This submission was made ""primarily because no drug was supplied"" . It was submitted that the Applicant's role was at the lower end of any hierarchy and was motivated by a desire to obtain money to repay a debt (T2, 20 August 2010). 

20The Crown submitted that the offence lay above the lower end of the range of objective seriousness. The Crown pointed to the Applicant's agreement to supply 1,000 tablets with the intention that they be disseminated into the community to end users. It was submitted further that it was immaterial that the powder supplied did not contain any prohibited drug. A quantity of about 249 grams of powder had been supplied. The Crown observed that this quantity lay about half way in the commercial quantity for MDMA, which lay between 125 and 500 grams. The Crown submitted that the Applicant was more of a ""middle person"" than a ""facilitator"" (T5-6, 20 August 2010). 

21The sentencing Judge made a number of factual findings, culminating in a finding that the Applicant's offence ""probably falls just very slightly under the middle of the range"" . His Honour made the following findings (ROS6-8): 

""The offender was the person who dealt with the undercover police officer. She offered to supply a thousand ecstasy tablets. He, at all times, dealt with her and she did it to make a profit but it appears that above her was a co-offender who seems to me to play a greater part in this. In other words, to get those tablets she goes to the co-offender, he then goes to another person, referred to as 'Peter Pan', and I will conveniently use that reference, who supplies to him. So she, in effect, whilst negotiating and making a profit, is still reliant on her co-offender who is reliant on this other person. She is there physically when the drugs are meant to be handed over and she plays an active part in that. The amount of drug to be supplied was significant. The drug itself was not supplied. I am not sure of what occurred. There was no doubt that the intention was to supply it but for some reason it was not. However, as the Crown has pointed out in their submissions and, in particular, referring to the decision of R v Yaghi (2002) 133 ACR at 490 where [it was] said: 

'It is regrettably a fact of life within the organised drug trade that 'rip-offs' occur, that those who choose to cloak such an endeavour with the appearance of a genuine drug [deal] , must accept the consequences if their conduct happens to fall within the specific provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.' 

And several cases are quoted. Each of those cases 'confirmed that the relevant mens rea was that relating to the agreement or conspiracy to make an offer to supply which would be regarded by the offeree as genuine rather than an intention to perform it'. But in this case it is slightly different than that because she did intend to perform it. She intended to hand over those pills in return for a significant amount of money. However, also present with her at the time was the co-offender who was playing a very active role. The point of that case, as I see it, is that whether you actually supply the amount or whether you offer to supply it but for some reason it does not get handed over the [law] still regards that as supply. 

It is argued on her behalf that I should assess this matter at the lower end of the range. I do not agree and I do not agree for these reasons. The amount to be supplied was significant. The part played by the offender was significant. Whilst lesser than the other two she was actively sourcing these drugs and was actively there to hand them over. I concluded, having reviewed a number of matters, that she probably falls into a category which is slightly under the middle range. I concluded that by taking into account the part she played, the fact the drugs were not actually supplied, that she did not at any stage actually have the thousand tablets, but she certainly intended to. But also taking into account that the amount of powder supplied, even though it was not a prohibited drug, was still a very significant amount and I take into account also the amount of the drugs to be supplied. Taking all those matters, and particularly the part she was playing in all this, into account I feel that it probably falls just very slightly under the middle of the range. Under those circumstances and because of the plea of guilty I do not have to impose the standard non-parole period, but I must have reference to it."" 
 

Ground 2 - Suggested Error in Assessment of Objective Seriousness 

22It is appropriate to consider the second ground of appeal first. This ground is to be determined by reference to the sentencing proceedings before Garling DCJ. Any question of comparison with findings made by Hosking SC DCJ, following the sentencing hearing for Adel Abhari, do not arise for consideration under this ground. 

Submissions 

23Mr Barrow, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that it was not open to the sentencing Judge to make a finding that the Applicant's offence fell slightly under the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Although Mr Barrow sought to draw some assistance from a number of the findings of Hosking SC DCJ when sentencing the co-offender, he accepted that it was necessary for him to demonstrate error on the part of the Judge who sentenced the Applicant. 

24Mr Barrow submitted that the findings of the sentencing Judge ought to have led to a conclusion that the offence fell towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness. Although Garling DCJ was not taken to the decision in Vu v R [2006] NSWCCA 188, Mr Barrow submitted that this decision assisted the conclusion that his Honour fell into error in sentencing the Applicant. He submitted that the Applicant's offence was an isolated one and was not part of a course of conduct. Her role, according to the submission, was that of a facilitator or conduit. Whilst the Applicant appeared to believe the transaction was genuine, counsel submitted that she had no capacity whatsoever to fulfil the offer to supply the drugs. 

25Mr Barrow submitted that the part played by the Applicant was exceedingly limited, with the background to her involvement appearing to be as a consequence of an unpaid substantial debt arising from her work as a sex worker. He submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to find that the Applicant had been manipulated and exploited by Adel Abhari into participating as she had done. 

26Whilst acknowledging that the quantity of powder supplied in this case (249.2 grams) was substantial, counsel submitted that it was well below the upper threshold for this offence, with the commercial quantity range being 125 to 500 grams. 

27The Crown submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to make the finding which he did concerning the objective seriousness of the Applicant's offence. The Crown submitted that it was not accurate to describe this as an isolated offence, given the stated willingness of the Applicant to continue the relationship, with a reduced price if further supplies were to occur. 

28Further, the Crown submitted that the Applicant's motivation was profit. It was submitted that it was not accurate to portray the Applicant's role as that of a facilitator or conduit. The Crown pointed to the statement of agreed facts which demonstrated that the Applicant negotiated and secured the order with the undercover police operative. As the sentencing Judge had found, the Applicant had every intention to fulfil the order. There was nothing in the agreed facts to indicate that this was a scam or was obviously so to the Applicant. 

29To the extent that the Applicant sought to rely upon the decision in Vu v R , the Crown submitted that most of the factors identified by Hall J in that decision existed in this case. 

Decision 

30To make good the first ground of appeal, it is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that the finding concerning the objective seriousness of this offence was not open to the sentencing Judge: McBeth v R [2009] NSWCCA 235 at [30]. 

31In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282, Spigelman CJ (Simpson J agreeing) observed at [37]: 

""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour."" 


32The following features are of particular significance to the assessment of objective seriousness in this case: 

(a) the Applicant was the point of contact with the buyer and negotiated quantity and price - she was not a mere conduit or facilitator, but rather a significant frontline participant engaged in negotiation of price and quantity; 

(b) the Applicant was engaged in this activity for profit, and with the expectation of further profit should the offending continue - her explanation for needing the money does not reflect materially upon the objective seriousness of the offence; 

(c) at all times, the Applicant believed that she was to supply 1,000 ecstasy tablets which would make their way into the community and to end users of the drug - she did not believe or suspect that this was a ""rip off"" or scam being perpetrated on the buyer, rather she believed it was a substantial drug supply which was unlikely to be an isolated one; 

(d) the fact that the powder supplied was sodium bicarbonate was unknown to the Applicant - this feature does not significantly reduce the level of objective seriousness of this offence. 

33I accept the Crown submission that, even when measured by reference to the factors in Vu v R , the objective seriousness of the Applicant's offence cannot be minimised. I keep in mind, as well, the fact that Garling DCJ did not have the benefit of submissions by reference to factors mentioned in Vu v R . It is important that this Court does not engage in an artificial process, removed from the reality of the sentencing hearing, in determining whether error has been established in the imposition of sentence at first instance. 

34Of course, the list of factors in Vu v R at [89] constitutes a helpful summary, but it does not constitute a form of mandatory checklist. Consideration of the factors in Vu v R at [89] in this case leads to the following assessment. 

35Firstly, the terms of the offer, particularly as to quantity of the drug and price, reveals an offer to supply 1,000 ecstasy tablets at $13.00 per tablet, with a reduced price per tablet if the relationship continued. An actual supply of 249.2 grams of a substance which the Applicant believed to be ecstasy was made, just under half the upper limit of the commercial quantity for this drug. 

36Secondly, the agreed facts did not indicate that the Applicant's offer to supply was an isolated one, intended to be committed as a one-off offence. Rather, the negotiation between the Applicant and the buyer pointed at least to the prospect of an ongoing drug supply relationship. 

37Thirdly, the Applicant was motivated at least by commercial gain, if not greed. Some explanation was suggested by way of the need for money to pay a debt. However, this could not greatly assist the Applicant and, in any event, the Applicant did not give evidence which would have permitted some testing of her financial motivation. 

38Fourthly, the evidence established that the Applicant, at all material times, had the intention to fulfil the offer to supply 1,000 ecstasy tablets and believed that she had the capacity to satisfy this intention. 

39Fifthly, it was the case that, unbeknown to the Applicant, the substance that was being supplied was not ecstasy so that, viewed objectively, she did not have the capacity to fulfil the offer to supply the 1,000 ecstasy tablets. However, she believed that she did and this was not, in her mind, a ""rip off"" or scam arrangement. 

40Sixthly, it is clear that the Applicant attempted to fulfil the offer. She was directly involved in the supply of 249.2 grams of a substance which she believed was a prohibited drug. This was not a case where there were mere words, unaccompanied by significant action on the part of the Applicant. 

41To my mind, the finding concerning the objective seriousness of the Applicant's offence was open to the sentencing Judge. This is not a case where the factual findings of the Judge simply do not fit the ultimate classification of the offence. Nor is it a case where the recital of the matters disclosed in the agreed statement of facts ought have led to an inevitable conclusion that the Applicant's offence fell towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness. 

42I would reject the second ground of appeal. 

Ground 1 - The Parity Ground 

43The Applicant was sentenced by Garling DCJ on 23 August 2010. For reasons that were not explained in this Court, the co-offender, Adel Abhari, appeared before Hosking SC DCJ on 10 December 2010. The records of the two sets of proceedings in the District Court do not shed light on how the Applicant and her co-offender came to be dealt with at different times, before different sentencing Judges. 

44Following a lengthy sentencing hearing, at which Adel Abhari gave evidence and was cross-examined, Hosking SC DCJ adjourned the matter to 17 December 2010 for sentence. On that date, for an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, Adel Abhari was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 20 December 2009 and expiring on 19 June 2011, with a balance of term of 18 months commencing on 20 June 2011 and expiring on 19 December 2012. 

Submissions 

45Mr Barrow submitted that the disparity between the sentence imposed upon the Applicant and that imposed upon Adel Abhari is so marked as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the Applicant. 

46Although acknowledging that Adel Abhari gave evidence at his sentencing hearing, and that significantly different factual findings were made by Hosking SC DCJ to those reached by Garling DCJ in sentencing the Applicant, Mr Barrow submitted that the extent of the disparity between sentences was such as to make good the ground of appeal based upon parity. Counsel submitted that the differences between the objective seriousness of the offences committed by the two co-offenders could not reasonably give rise to the difference between sentences actually imposed. Further, counsel submitted that the subjective circumstances of Adel Abhari were less favourable than those of the Applicant. Adel Abhari had a prior conviction for a drug supply offence. 

47The Crown pointed to the significantly different findings made by the two sentencing Judges which served to explain the difference in sentences. The remarks on sentence of Garling DCJ had been brought to the attention of Hosking SC DCJ and his Honour concluded, for reasons which he gave, that no direct question of parity arose between the two offenders. The Crown submitted that Hosking SC DCJ certainly took a lenient approach in sentencing the co-offender but that, upon examination of the different findings of the two sentencing Judges based upon different bodies of evidence before each of them, the Applicant had not demonstrated a legitimate sense of grievance so as to make good the first ground of appeal. 

Related Offenders Sentenced by Different Judges 

48Before turning to determine this ground of appeal, some observations are appropriate concerning the sentencing proceedings for the two offenders before the District Court. 

49Although the Applicant and Adel Abhari were co-offenders in the same criminal enterprise, they came to be sentenced before different Judges on different occasions. It is not clear why this happened. The Applicant was committed for sentence from the Central Local Court on 24 June 2010 in relation to the charge for which she was sentenced. Adel Abhari was committed for sentence from the Central Local Court on 1 July 2010. There is an indication in the transcript of the sentencing hearing of 10 December 2010 concerning Adel Abhari, that his sentencing hearing had not been reached on a prior occasion. There is nothing to indicate why he did not proceed to a sentencing hearing, together with the Applicant, before Garling DCJ on 20 August 2010. 

50Courts have emphasised the desirability of related offenders appearing for sentence at the same time before the same Judge, and the problems which may arise where that practice is not followed. 

51The authorities were gathered in the decision of this Court in Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67 ( ""Dwayhi"" ) at [33]-[46]. It is appropriate to once again refer to these principles. 

52There are significant advantages where related offenders are sentenced by the same Judge at the same time, with remarks on sentence containing factual findings and conclusions concerning the relative criminality of the offenders and differing subjective features of each of them: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71]; Gurney v R; Willetts v R [2011] NSWCCA 48 at [81]-[82]; Dwayhi at [39]-[43]. 

53Different Judges may take different views as to the relevant culpability of related offenders: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 320; R v Mercieca [2004] VSCA 170 at [6]; Dwayhi at [35], [37]. 

54Where co-offenders are dealt with separately, there may be differences in the substratum of facts upon which the different sentencing Judges act and the impressions formed by them with respect to the relative roles, levels of responsibility and prospects of rehabilitation of the individuals involved, with this flowing in part from the different emphases which can be expected to be placed on aspects of the offending behaviour and the circumstances of the offenders: R v Rodden [2005] VSCA 24 at [28]; Dwayhi at [38]. 

55Strong maintenance of the practice of related offenders being sentenced by the same Judge at the same time will serve the public interest in consistent and transparent sentencing of related offenders which underlies the parity principle itself: Dwayhi at [46]. 

56A recurring theme in the authorities is that, where co-offenders are sentenced after hearings before different Judges, there may be different evidence and submissions, leading to different conclusions being expressed by the sentencing Judges concerning criminal conduct of persons involved in the same criminal enterprise. 

57The present case constitutes a vivid illustration of that problem. 

The Parity Principle 

58The relevant principles are well known, but it is useful to restate them before moving to the resolution of this appeal. 

59Disparity between sentences is not of itself a basis of appellate intervention, but a factor to be weighed when the Court considers whether the sentencing process has been attended by error and, if so, whether the Court should intervene: R v Li [2005] NSWCCA 154 at [44]; Dwayhi at [25]. 

60A complaint of disparity accepts that the sentence imposed on an offender cannot otherwise be challenged. It is the sentence imposed upon a co-offender which is said to give rise to a sense of injustice, not the sentence imposed upon the offender: Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189 at [7]; Dwayhi at [26]. 

61The test for determining whether there is a legitimate sense of grievance is objective. What has to be demonstrated by an applicant is not that he or she feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the applicant's grievance is justified: R v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 at [34]; Dwayhi at [21]. 

62Where there is a degree of disparity so as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for this Court to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective circumstances. This Court will not necessarily intervene where the co-offender's sentence is so inadequate that the Court should not take it into account: Lewins v R at [7]; Dwayhi at [21]. 

63A ground asserting disparity is concerned with such markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on co-offenders that they give rise to a genuine feeling on the part of a reasonable and impartial observer that justice has not been achieved because one offender has been unfairly treated, having regard to the sentence passed upon the other offender. What is required is a gross, marked, glaring or manifest disparity: England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[67]; Dwayhi at [23]-[24]. 

Decision 

64Adel Abhari gave extensive evidence and was cross-examined at his sentencing hearing concerning his involvement in the criminal enterprise (T7-29, 10 December 2010). The remarks on sentence of Garling DCJ concerning the Applicant were placed before Hosking SC DCJ. Submissions were made by reference to the evidence adduced before Hosking SC DCJ, which sought to differentiate the sentencing decision for that offender from that which had been made, four months earlier, with respect to the Applicant. 

65Hosking SC DCJ reached a different conclusion concerning the objective seriousness of Adel Abhari's offence (ROS2-3, 17 December 2010): 

""Judge Garling took the view that in Ms Rae's case the objective criminality of her part in this offence fell just below the mid range of objective seriousness. For the reasons I am about to give, I take the view that in relation to Mr Abhari that the objective criminality of what he did fell very much towards the lower end of the applicable scale. I will soon set out my reasoning for that conclusion."" 

66Hosking SC DCJ proceeded to make findings of fact. His Honour observed that Adel Abhari had referred at times to another person, Peter Pan, with his Honour being ""satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was no such person as Peter Pan, not only a person by that name, but that no person even using that name ever existed"" (ROS2). His Honour referred again to the evidence of Adel Abhari (ROS4): 

""In the offender's sworn evidence he said that there never were any Asians. He said that Peter Pan was a fiction. He said that he never intended to supply a prohibited drug to Rae or the undercover operative. In effect he did not have the wherewithal to supply any prohibited drug to Rae, the undercover operative or anyone else. He said that his reference to 'it's the coke for the Asians, my God it was to go to the Asians' was a kind of ruse like Peter Pan was a ruse in what to my mind was an almost comical attempt to explain away the fact that he had recently participated in what is commonly called colloquially a drug rip off."" 

67Hosking SC DCJ stated that he found the evidence of Adel Abhari credible and that he was inclined to believe him (ROS5). His Honour then proceeded to consider the factors referred to by Hall J in Vu v R at [89] (ROS5-7). After considering Adel Abhari's subjective circumstances, Hosking SC DCJ returned to the sentence imposed by Garling DCJ on the Applicant (ROS9): 

""I have factored in, in a general way, or at least I have taken into account, Ms Rae's sentence by his Honour Judge Garling. In my view there is no direct question of parity between the two of them because their mental states were so different, even though they committed the same offence. Ms Rae evidently is appealing what she says is the severity of her sentence. I simply note that as a fact I have been told. For reasons I have indicated, in my view there are significantly different factors applying to the sentence of Mr Abhari compared to the sentence of Ms Rae."" 

68This Court has observed that considerable obstacles are faced by an applicant seeking to invoke the parity principle in circumstances where the sentencing Judge was fully aware of the sentences imposed upon a co-offender and the reasons for those sentences, and indicates in the sentencing remarks why the Judge is departing from the co-offender's sentence: Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [58]. In this case, Hosking SC DCJ explained why he was reaching different conclusions, based upon a significantly different body of evidence, to those conclusions that had been reached by Garling DCJ with respect to the Applicant. 

69There is a substantial difference in the quantum of sentences imposed upon the Applicant and Adel Abhari. However, there was a significant difference in the evidence before the two Judges, and the findings and conclusions reached by those Judges by reference to the evidence adduced at the separate sentencing hearings. 

70In my view, the Applicant has not demonstrated an objective legitimate sense of grievance so as to make good this ground of appeal. A reasonable and impartial observer would have regard to what took place at the different hearings, and the conclusions reached by the respective Judges by reference to the evidence and submissions before them. The substantial difference between the sentences imposed upon the two offenders is explained by the substantially different factual findings arising from the very different evidentiary foundations before the two Judges. 

71It might be readily concluded as well that Adel Abhari was fortunate to achieve a lenient sentencing outcome. That, however, was the product of a hearing which took a very different course to that of the Applicant. 

72In my view, this ground of appeal has not been made good. 

Conclusion 

73The Applicant has not demonstrated error on the part of the sentencing Judge in accordance with Ground 2, nor has she established an objective legitimate sense of grievance in accordance with the first ground of appeal. 

74I observe that, even if error had been demonstrated, I would not have been persuaded that some lesser sentence should have been passed so as to warrant a substituted sentence for the purposes of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 
 
75I propose the following orders: 

(a) leave to appeal granted; 

(b) appeal against sentence dismissed.

		14 September 2011",2011-09-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2709177,Regina v CUR24 [2011] NSWDC 177,"APPLICATION 

Preliminary matters : 
1Application has been made on behalf of CUR24 that I should disqualify myself from embarking upon his sentencing for child sex offences of which he was convicted by a jury and of embarking upon a trial of CUR 24 for child sex offences unrelated to those of his first trial. The claim is one of apprehended bias. 

2The application was made as a motion supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Greg Walsh, Solicitor. After embarking on the hearing and deciding that I should deal with the matter and I should give reasons for doing so, I became aware of a decision of the Court of Appeal (Barton v Walker ([1979] 2 NSWLR 740) that casts doubt on the appropriateness of doing so. Indeed, the Court was of the view that the motion was not cognizable. After all, how does a Judge order himself not to do something and how would such an order be enforceable? 

3I also considered whether I should, as O'Brien J did, order that the application be removed from the file because it was not cognizable. However, what I have decided to do is to deal with the matter on its merits and dispose of the controversy. I gratefully accept the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, however, and because of this, this decision is not entitled, as a decision on a motion regularly brought would be, in the name of the Queen and the accused. I refer to the applicant throughout by a code name I gave him some time ago to protect his identity. 

Facts: 
4Before going further with the application, it is important that I should first set out a chronology of the proceedings so far. 

5On 27th September 2010 I commenced the trial of CUR 24, with a voir dire hearing to determine legal issues before the jury was empanelled on 2nd November 2010. Ultimately, on 29th November 2010, the jury convicted him on three charges of indecent assault and on 30th November, 2010 the jury convicted him of a further five charges of indecent assault. He was found not guilty of two charges of indecent assault. 

6After the jury was discharged, a hearing was held on 30th November on the question of bail and following this hearing, I refused bail and CUR24, who had been on bail, was taken into custody, where he still remains. 

7Before this trial commenced, the parties told me that a number of trials, perhaps 4 or 5 would need to be held to deal with the large number of charges that had been laid against CUR24 and I said that I would do all trials, so that there could be consistency in legal rulings and if there were convictions, consistency in sentencing. It was not possible to commence the next trial in 2010 and I directed that it commence on 7th February 2011. 

8On 17th December 2010, the question of sentencing was ventilated, but I decided not to proceed to sentence because it might generate unwelcome and prejudicial publicity. It was not possible, as I saw it to sentence CUR24 and to direct that details of the sentence be suppressed (see John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of NSW & Ors (2004) 61 NSWLR 344) 

9On 7th February 2011, I commenced the second trial with a voir dire hearing. On 21 February 2011 I indicated what evidence I was likely to allow and I gave written reasons for that on 22 February. Mr Philip Boulten SC, counsel for CUR24 told me that he had instructions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal for leave to appeal against my decision. That application was made and I understand a hearing was held. So far, no decision has been given by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

10The question of undertaking a sentence hearing was mentioned before me again on 27th January 2011, the 3rd February 2011, the 11th February 2011 and 25th February 2011, but I did not set down any hearing for sentence as I wanted to see what the Court of Criminal Appeal determined in the application for leave to appeal against my pre- trial rulings 

11The first trial concerned child sex offences against girls but the other trials, I was told, would all concern allegations that CUR24 committed child sex offences against boys when he was a teacher an d a priest at Saint Stanislaus College, Bathurst some years ago. 

12It was apparent at the time of the first trial that the arrest of CUR24 had generated a considerable degree of publicity and during the voir dire proceedings at the second trial it was clear that there were a number of websites that made allegations of a serious nature against CUR24 and against others. 

13Indeed, a great deal of the time occupied in the voir dire for the second trial was devoted to dealing with the question whether any of the likely witnesses and/or complainants and/or tendency witnesses were affected by the pre-trial publicity so that the giving of evidence by them would not be fair. 

14On 15 March 2011, Mr Clive Jeffreys Solicitor was sworn in as a judge of this Court and I attended the swearing in as one of the judges sitting on the bench. At this time, there was no likely hearing before me of any matter concerning CUR24. No sentence date had been fixed, nor was it possible to continue with the second trial. 

15As was customary following a swearing in of a new judge, morning tea was provided to anyone who wished to attend. Normally those attending included the judge and his family, his friends, other judges, other lawyers and administrative and legal staff of the District Court. It was common for Associates to attend and as far as I am aware, anybody who wished to attend, could attend. No formal invitations are ever issued. 

16These morning teas are always informal. There are never any speeches. They are occasions where people present mingle around. Usually, I am present at them for no more than about 15 minutes. 

17The morning tea is always held in a large room on the 21st Floor which is used as a Judges' Common Room. From time to time other receptions are held in this room and sometimes the Judicial Commission of New South Wales organises seminars in this room. 

18Mr Greg Walsh solicitor, attended the swearing in ceremony and the morning tea. He frequently attends these ceremonies and the morning tea after the ceremony. 

19I have known Mr Walsh personally for more than 30 years. When I was a barrister, he would brief me to appear for his clients from time to time. For the most part I appeared in civil cases. 

20Mr Walsh has always a done a considerable amount of criminal law work in his practice and in the few years before 2000, when I became a judge, he developed a considerable practice appearing for Catholic priests and brothers who were charged with child sex offences. At one stage, he frequently briefed Mr Chester Porter QC to appear for his clients. He also briefed other barristers to appear for them and he appeared for some of them directly. To my knowledge he has appeared in such cases in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia. From time to time, over the years, I have met him on a social basis and have discussed in a broad sense this part of his practice. 

21Within the past few years, he has borrowed from me a set of robes I had kept from my days as a junior counsel, my barristers wig and some jabots so that he could appear as counsel in the Supreme Court of Tasmania in a child sex case involving a priest or a brother. He discussed this briefly with me. 

22After the CUR24 case commenced, I cannot recollect discussing child sex cases with him in any way except perhaps in passing. If I bumped into him in the street, he might mention that he had another case. I have never discussed CUR24 with him at all. 

23I can remember Mr Walsh being present at the swearing-in and at the morning tea ceremony and I recollect him telling me at the morning tea ceremony that he was particularly there because the new judge, like him, was a solicitor. 

24I have considered Mr Walsh's claims about what I said to him at the morning tea but I am unable to agree that I used the words attributed to me, apart perhaps from greeting him on the basis that he was appearing for another paedophile, something that he then confirmed. That greeting was a friendly one. I am absolutely certain I did not tell him that I had a view that all paedophiles should be put on an island and starved to death. 

25It is my memory that some years ago, during the hearing of the paedophile reference at the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police service, a psychologist was asked by the Commissioner, Wood J, what he thought could be done to rehabilitate paedophiles. My recollection is that he expressed the view that they should all be placed on an island. I have no memory that he considered the island should be a desert island or that they should be starved to death. My memory may be an imperfect one and I have not had access to any Royal Commission transcript to refresh my memory. 

26This view, understandably enough, was rejected by the Commissioner. I did not take this man to be making a serious suggestion that paedophiles should be exiled. Rather, it seemed to me that he was expressing a view that rehabilitation was very difficult. He was engaging in a form of hyperbole. I feel confident that Wood J did not have a view that the witness had a literal view that paedophiles should be marooned. 

27It may be that I recounted to Mr Walsh something of what this man had said but I cannot ever recollect this man talking about starving them to death. That is what makes me confident that I did not at any point express such a view, which I would regard as abhorrent. 

28I think I may have said, ""Greg, I heard someone say that what should be done with paedophiles is to put them all on an island"", but I doubt that I said this as the second thing I said to him when I met him. It seems probable to me that we said more to one another than what he has deposed to, because my experience of social occasions is that there is a great deal of small talk in even the briefest of conversations. 

29I also have never expressed an opinion to Mr Walsh that all persons charged with paedophile offences are guilty. It is perfectly obvious that many of those who are charged are found not guilty and in the case of SKA v the Queen (reported in [2009] NSWCCA 186; [2011]HCA11), I expressed the view that the accused should not have been convicted at all. This view was rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal and the sentence I imposed on SKA was doubled. 

30I do not know how Mr Walsh came to the conclusion that I made the comments he attributes to me. I also do not understand how he could possibly believe that I had a personal view that pedophiles should be put on a desert island and starved to death. Whatever was said by me to him was said in passing at a noisy social function. It was not a considered statement of opinion, such as might be expressed by someone at a seminar or in a newspaper article. 

31It seems probable to me that he has misunderstood what I did say. It seems clear that he did not at any time during this brief conversation ask me what I meant or whether I was serious in what I said. At no point did he raise with me my views on sentencing. If he was really concerned by what I said, I would have expected him to have raised it with me. 

32He would have access to the AUSTLII database and I would think he would be aware of all relevant decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court. He would have been aware of the Court of Criminal Appeal decision on SKA v the Queen (supra) since it was delivered on 14th July 2009. Well before he made the current application he would have been aware of the High Court decision in the same matter, since it was delivered on 4th May 2011. 

33Because the application was made to me 6 months after the swearing-in, I find myself in the position where I cannot recollect with any accuracy at all what words passed between us. That is to be expected. Indeed, it would be remarkable if I were to have a memory of words spoken at a chance encounter at a social event 6 months ago. If the application had been made within a few days of the swearing in, it is possible my memory would be better. 

34I hold no view about what sentence I should impose on CUR24. As far as I am aware, no evidence of any substance has been presented to me. No submissions have been made to me and I have not considered the matter at all. I also want to make it plain that I have no opinion on whether CUR24 is or is not guilty of any other offences. The Jury that is empanelled decides that question. 

35When I decided to hear all the trials, I did so on the basis that I expected they would run fairly soon after one another, but that now is not at all possible and I would have to consider whether I preside over any further trials of CUR24. I must retire in 3 years and 5 months. I may well decide to retire earlier and I have doubts that I would want to embark on further trials if there was a real possibility that the trials would not finish before my retirement. 

The Law. 
36The argument is advanced that I should discharge myself from sentencing CUR24 and from conducting any further trials of CUR24, because "" a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind"" to deciding sentence or conducting further proceedings( See Johnson v Johnson(2000) 201 CLR 488) 

37As is said in the headnote to Kwan v Kang [2003] NSWCA 336, 

"" The element of reasonableness needs to be stressed. (Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1990 170 CLR 70). There must be a reasonable apprehension on the part of the fictitious observer that the decision maker's mind is so prejudiced in favour of a conclusion already formed that he or she might not alter that conclusion, irrespective of the evidence or the arguments."" 

38It is first of all important to determine what the independent lay observer might reasonably apprehend in the circumstances that obtained. What Mr Walsh observed is not to the point. 

39In my opinion, what an independent lay observer might reason ably have apprehended was that: 
The words spoken were uttered between two men who knew one another well enough to greet one another by their first names. The exchanges between them were brief and uttered in a noisy atmosphere where many people were talking at once and people were moving from group to group . 

40Neither Mr Walsh or I at any time mentioned the name of CUR24 or talked in any way about his sentencing or his upcoming trial or the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

41Neither of us were talking about any case or any theory of sentencing. What I said in reporting what a man had said some years ago, clearly was not meant to be taken seriously . 

42The words "" might reasonably have apprehended"" mean what they say - the independent lay observer must be applying reason. 

43In Zanatta v McCleary ([1976]NSWLR 230) the Court of Appeal considered an appeal where the appellants sought to put affidavit evidence before the Court to show that after he had delivered judgment in a civil case, a judge had spoken to a number of lawyers at a function and had told them that he had, with the assistance of the Deputy Sheriff, checked his impressions of the evidence of a medical practitioner by contacting the doctor informally and out of court. 

44The Court of Appeal refused to receive the affidavits. 

45Street C.J said this(232 D-E), inter alia: 
"" Before coming to the legal significance of the matters advanced on this appeal, some preliminary comment is called for. Passing over the question of the prudence of a judge taking part in a conversation in such terms as are alleged in the affidavits, it is a departure from the dictates of good taste, and a regrettable repudiation of the privilege of professional intimacy for counsel and solicitor, made privy to a confidential, albeit indiscreet, disclosure by a judge to publish to the world at large the sentiments and information thus confided in them......"" 

46Samuels J.A (239G -240B) said this: 
""The affidavits assert that, in the conversation which they purport to recount, the learned judge not only offered a private exposition of the grounds upon which he determined the factual issues before him, but dilated upon his own experience in support of his opinion. It is, however, unnecessary to decide whether this encounter took place in the terms alleged; and I do not do so. But it would be destructive of the mutual confidence which must exist between the bench and the profession , if social occasions were to be used as a means of recording a judge's private conversation, however imprudent, for the purpose of showing that he has expressed personal views of a particular kind."" 

47There is weighty authority for the proposition that the decision of a judge as to whether to disqualify himself is not to be decided upon motions and as a contested question of fact (See Australian National Industries v Spedley (26NSWLR411 at 436 per Mahoney JA) . 

48The reasoning behind what Mahoney JA has said applies with considerable force in the present situation, since the facts are not clear, there is no reference in any of them to any litigant nor to any litigation and all depends on how the facts are construed. This is far from any known case where disqualification for ostensible bias has been raised. In all reported cases,(except two) litigation was actually in progress, the parties were known and the facts were clear. 

49In the two exceptional cases of Newcastle City Council v Lindsay ([2004] NSWCA 198) and Timmins v Gormley ([2000] 1 All ER 65) the judge had written articles indicating a decided view on litigation frequently before her and him) That was not the situation here because I was not at a seminar and was not delivering my considered views on anything 

50I am not suggesting that because there is a social occasion, a Judge cannot indicate bias on his part against a particular litigant, (indeed, see the Fiji case referred to by Mr Boulten) but where no litigant is named or is the subject of any discussion at all, I find it extremely difficult to see the basis on which it is in any way appropriate for lawyers to report parts of a conversation that allegedly occurred 6 months previously during a social occasion and say that by some form of necessary implication, the judge can be understood to have been referring to a particular case. 

51In the present instance, I have already presided over a trial that has led to some convictions of CUR24. That trial finished almost 4 months before the morning tea. 

52The fact is that I have not at any time expressed any opinion about the CUR24. Nor could any remarks of mine at the morning tea be seriously accepted as indicating a bias against child sex offenders of such a nature that any persons charged with such offences could reasonably apprehend I judged them in advance of trial and conviction. 

53I have presided over many trials involving such offenders. I have always left the decision to the jury and have made it plain that I do not attempt to influence their decisions. In the case of SKA(supra), I twice published judgments, once on bail and once on sentence in which I made clear my view that SKA should not have been convicted. I also expressed my distaste about applying to this case a sentence of the severity of the prescribed standard non-parole period 

54Mr Walsh would have been aware of SKA and would have been aware of my careful approach to summing up cases before a jury. 

55If there were any substance in the claims, they should have been made very close to the time of the morning tea. I would then have had some chance of remembering more clearly what was said and the context in which it was said. Waiting 6 months to put on an application of this type and to make it in fact, not on any of the previous mention days, but on the day I had decided I would fix a sentence date, is quite unfair. 

56In Vakautu v Kelly((1989) 167 ALR 568) the High Court had to consider a number of claims that a quite distinguished NSW judge had shown ostensible bias. Part of the claim concerned remarks made during the hearing that some doctors to be called by the appellant were an ""unholy trinity. ""No objection was taken at the time about these remarks. In his reasons for judgment delivered some time later, the Judge made further critical remarks about one of the doctors, in effect describing his evidence as being negative "" as it always is and based as usual upon his non-acceptance of the genuineness of the plaintiff's complaints of pain"" 

57The High Court (see Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ) held ( p 637) that 
"" if the above comments made by the learned trial judge in the course of the trial had stood alone, we would have been of the view that the appellant having taken no clearly stated objection to them at the time and having stood by until the contents of his Honour's judgment were known, could not now found upon them in order to have that judgment set aside on the grounds of a reasonable apprehension of bias"" 

58If the Judge had not, in his reasons for judgment, made a further series of allegations against the doctors, a finding of ostensible bias would not have been made. 

59The same reasoning applies here and with even more force because the claims are based on unrecorded discussions at a morning tea function 6 months ago. For that reason alone, it would be appropriate to refuse the application. 

60Mr Phillip Boulten S.C has referred me to many cases, including a Fiji case of a Judge indicating at a social function that he would ""put away"" a particular person appearing before him for sentence. That case has some similarities to Branko Balic (no 2)(1994) 75 ACrim R 515 where a judge was overheard speaking to another judge and forecasting that he would refuse bail to a named person (Balic) then appearing before him, notwithstanding there was no application to do so by the Crown, nor had the Judge given the accused any indication of any intention to do so. 

61The Fiji case and the Balic case are the only cases to which I have been referred of ostensible bias being found as a result of something said informally out of court. Both were cases where the judge made predictions about what he would do to an identifiable person then appearing before him. They are factually different to the present case. 

62In the present application, I am being asked to disqualify myself, not because I expressed any opinion about CUR 24, and in circumstances where I had nothing before me in Court any decision to make about him, but because I expressed intemperate but unquestioned views (if Mr Walsh is correct) in which it is said I advocated illegal exile, torture and murder of paedophiles, something that I deny doing. 

63There are numerous authorities for the proposition that a Judge should not disqualify himself merely because someone asks him to do this ( see for example Fitzgerald v DPP (1991) 24 NSWLR 45; re JL ex p CJL(1986) 161 CLR 342 at 352) As I said when this application was made on 9th September 2011, it would be an easy way out for me to accede to this application, but that is not a proper basis for doing this. 

64I refuse the application because I said and did nothing to indicate any form of prejudgment on my part of any litigation involving CUR24. There was no litigation before me at the time of the morning tea and in my opinion, no lay observer could reasonably apprehend that my mind was affected by bias against CUR24 . 

65I also refuse it, because the application was made too long after the 15th March 2011 morning tea . 

66I order that no mention be made of the identity of the applicant. I permit the media to have access to the affidavit of Mr Walsh, but I order that there is to be no publication of the names of any judges mentioned in the affidavit, other than my name.

		21 November 2011",2011-09-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2709179,R v John SMITH* [2011] NSWDC 233,"Judgment


1John Smith has been charged with some serious crimes. They are allegations of sexual assaults committed against people who were under 16 years of age. They are said to have been committed in the early to mid 1990s. 

2There were tendered before me a report from a neuro-psychologist, Dr Susan Pulman, dated 12 November 2010 and a report from the Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 27 June 2010.

3Mr Smith has not yet been arraigned on charges for those offences which are alleged against him. The reports raised - Mr L Shaw of counsel who is Crown Prosecutor and Mr D C McCallum of counsel, representing Mr Smith, agreed - a question of Mr Smith's unfitness to be tried for the offences. I determined that an enquiry should be conducted into that question and I took into account the evidence of those two reports. I am satisfied that the question has been raised in good faith.

4Mr McCallum represented Mr Smith throughout the inquiry which was not conducted in an adversary manner and I note the provisions of s 12 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 regarding the onus of proof. The question of whether or not a person is fit to be tried - or, as the Act says, the question of a person's unfitness to be tried - is usually judged according to criteria set out by Smith J in the Victorian decision of Regina v Presser [1958] VR 45; [1958] ALR 248. I will return to those criteria shortly.

5In her report Dr Pulman described Mr Smith as a ""[age] year old man with a history of alcohol dependence who sustained an extremely traumatic .. injury in [year]"". She thought that Mr Smith's ""difficulties in encoding of new material are likely to impact on his fitness to stand trial"". She recommended that Mr Smith ""undergo a psychiatric review to determine whether his self reported memory difficulties relating to his past maybe due to psychological factors"". 

6That is why Dr Allnutt was asked to assess Mr Smith. Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that when he saw Mr Smith, Mr Smith ""was manifesting some mild depressive symptoms more consistent with an adjustment disorder with a depressed mood than a major depressive episode"". He has, apparently, retrograde amnesia going back some years and has no recollection of the time or circumstances of the allegations against him. Dr Allnutt noted that in Dr Pulman's review Mr Smith could not recall the nature of the charges or the role of the Prosecutor or how he provided instructions, and he also noted that there was some concern about his memory but said that ""when it comes to fitness to stand trial the most significant concern would be his capacity encode new material, as this could impact on his capacity to follow proceedings"".

7Dr Allnutt then reviewed some findings he made during his interview and concluded that the factors which he reviewed ""suggest a relative ability to encode new material and an ability to encode new material as they pertain to his legal proceedings"". He thought he understood about entering a plea to the charge and the nature of pleas available to him and the consequences of pleading one way or the other. He generally understood the nature of the proceedings and what was going on in court in a general sense. He understood what evidence was and that it could be used for and against him. 

8Dr Allnutt said that ""the issue of concern would be his capacity to follow the course of the proceedings and assist in his defence by giving counsel instructions; overall there is evidence to suggest that he has had interactions with counsel and has understood them and has been negotiating with counsel around his trial."" Dr Allnutt believed that Mr Smith ""is capable of providing his version of the facts, even though he has lack of memory for the actual facts."" Dr Allnutt concluded as follows - 

""Generally I would be of the view that while this is a somewhat difficult case (given his lack of drive and concern about performance in neuropsychological assessment and the ongoing evidence for progenitive deficient), on balance, he is fit to stand trial."" 

9I am satisfied upon Dr Allnutt's evidence that all of the criteria set out by Smith J in Presser are met. The one reservation I have is - as Dr Allnutt had - about Mr Smith's ability to follow the course of the proceedings.

10Mr McCallum in his submissions - in which he made clear that he did not urge me to find one way or the other - drew my attention to the basis upon which Dr Allnutt reached his view about his client's ability to encode new material. I have some reservations about that ability but, like Dr Allnutt, on balance, which is the standard that I must apply, I find that he is able to encode new material and would be able to follow the course of the proceedings and I am of the opinion that he is fit to stand trial.

11Needless to say, as the Act provides, a question of a person's unfitness for trial can be raised at anytime. It may well be, in a case such as this, that when the trial gets underway the concerns which the psychiatrist and the psychologist had in predicting or anticipating Mr Smith's future behaviour may be realised. It may be found that he is not able to follow the course of the proceedings but, at this stage, like them, I am limited to expressing an opinion as to the likelihood. Hence, I repeat, in my opinion Mr Smith is fit to be tried.

HIS HONOUR: I think that is all. I just express that opinion and then things follow according to the Act. The proceedings are to continue or recommence and Mr Shaw lent me this, the Howard Westmore book, Mr Davies if you would return that to Mr Shaw with my thanks. Now Mr McCallum.

MCCALLUM: Just in relation to the further conduct your Honour I suspect your Honour, the appropriate order to make is that your Honour will put it into a telephone call over at some stage.

HIS HONOUR: I will do whatever you two think is the appropriate course. What do I do?

MCCALLUM: Perhaps in four weeks time your Honour, if your Honour--

HIS HONOUR: Okay, give me a date, I'll make an order.

MCCALLUM: Wednesday the 19 October.

12I list this matter for a telephone callover on Wednesday 19 October 2011.

HIS HONOUR: Any other order I need to make?

MCCALLUM: I'd ask your Honour to continue the bail.

HIS HONOUR: Present conditions Mr Davies?

DAVIES: Bail is not opposed.

13Bail is continued on the same conditions as presently fixed, which means a blue form will be coming.

MCCALLUM: I know your Honour has stressed a number of times on each occasion that this mention has been mentioned in open court, that Mr Smith's name is not to be mentioned outside of the court. Just one matter that is causing him considerable stress and he has asked me to put on the record.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

MCCALLUM: And that is your Honour there has apparently been some internet publicity connecting Mr Smith with the crimes that he is alleged to have committed and that is a matter that is causing him some considerable anxiety and stress your Honour and it is something that in his mind is creating perception that he is not going to be able to get a fair trial. He has just asked that I place that on the record your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Am I right in thinking the reason for his name not being able to be mentioned in open court, is that it could identify the alleged victims, is that the case?

MCCALLUM: I suspect that is right your Honour.

DAVIES: That's correct your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And am I right in thinking that anyone who identifies an alleged victim of a sexual assault outside the court room is guilty of an offence?

DAVIES: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Smith is quite right and thank you Mr McCallum for drawing it to my attention on two points. One is that it is important that Mr Smith receives a fair trial and any internet publicity could adversely impact on a jury, although hopefully no one would be reading it, but nevertheless it has that potential. Secondly, it should be noted that my understanding is, confirmed by Mr Davies, that publicising the name or identifying an alleged victim of a sexual assault outside the court is a criminal offence and in this case according to what I am told, identifying Mr Smith is a means of identifying the alleged victims. I'm just putting that on the record.

MCCALLUM: Thank you your Honour, I will make some inquiries about, I haven't done any searches for my own part to confirm the instructions, I've just been told today but I will do that your Honour--

HIS HONOUR: It's appropriate to put it on the record, there is nothing I can do about it apart from saying what I have said, which really doesn't go anywhere apart from confirming that Mr Smith should be concerned. It is appropriate for him to be concerned and people should not be disclosing his identity on the Internet and bail is continuing until a date to be fixed.

2The effective sentence received by the applicant was a total of 7 years imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of 5 years and an additional term of 2 years. The sentence was structured in the following manner: 

The fixed terms imposed for counts 6 and 7 were made concurrent with one another (commencing on 16 April 2009); 
The fixed term imposed for count 1 was partially accumulated upon the sentences for counts 6 and 7 by 3 months (commencing on 16 July 2009); 
The fixed term imposed for count 2 was partially accumulated upon the sentence for count 1 by 3 months (commencing on 16 October 2009); 
The fixed term imposed for count 5 was partially accumulated upon the sentence for count 2 by 1 year and 3 months (commencing on 16 January 2011); 
The non-parole period for count 3 was partially accumulated upon the sentence for count 5 by 3 months (commencing on 16 April 2011); 
The fixed terms imposed for counts 8 and 9 were made concurrent with the sentence for count 3 (also commencing on 16 April 2011). 

3The applicant seeks leave to raise three grounds of appeal, two of which are effectively conceded by the Crown. The third raises considerations of parity with the sentence imposed on a co-offender. 

4The grounds are as follows: 

Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred by backdating the applicant's sentence to commence after the expiry of the parole period of an earlier sentence of imprisonment. 

Ground 2: The applicant's sentence is indicative of error in that individual sentences passed upon him are inconsistent with one another. 

Ground 3: The applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance when the individual sentences he received for counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 are compared with corresponding or relevant individual sentences imposed upon his co-offender Adam Aiken. 

5The effective sentence was backdated to commence on 16 April 2009. That date was fixed by reference to the expiry date of the parole period for an earlier sentence of imprisonment which the applicant was serving when he committed the offences. The date is the subject of the first ground of appeal. It was submitted that it was an error to backdate the effective sentence to commence after the expiry of an earlier parole period in circumstances where the applicant was eligible for release to parole and no decision to deny him parole was made. 

6The Crown accepts the legitimacy of this complaint for it effectively results in the applicant being punished twice for the later offence. The issue was considered by this Court in R v Ellmore [2002] NSWCCA 242. A sentencing court is required to take into account any time which an offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence or offences for which he or she is to be sentenced: ss 24 and 47(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. A sentencing judge retains a discretion as to whether or not a sentence should be backdated to commence on a date prior to the expiry of a parole period of an earlier sentence when an offender's parole has been revoked ( Callaghan v The Queen (2006) 160 A Crim R 145). However, it is erroneous to backdate a sentence to commence on a date prior to the expiry of a parole period of an earlier sentence, in circumstances where an offender's parole has not been revoked. 

7As it happened the applicant's custody after 16 October 2008 was solely referrable to the present offences. He was eligible for release to parole on that date. No order for revocation of parole was made by the Parole Board in relation to the earlier period of custody. It was appropriate for the sentencing judge to have regard to the fact that the offences were committed during a period of incarceration as an aggravating feature but otherwise the sentence ought to have been commenced on 16 October 2008. In my judgment this Court must re-sentence to have regard to this issue. 

8The second ground of appeal concerns the individual sentences. It was firstly submitted that the sentences are inconsistent with one another and secondly that the sentencing judge erred by imposing fixed terms that were not the equivalent of minimum terms. 

9The sentencing judge found that count 3 was the most serious offence for which the applicant was to be sentenced. This count involved the greatest quantity of drugs (164.4 g of methylamphetamine) and the Form 1 matter was considered with this count. The sentence imposed was a total term of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. However, in relation to counts 1 and 2 a fixed term was imposed which was greater than the non-parole period for count 3. The fixed term for count 5 was the same as the non-parole period for count 3. 

10The distinguishing feature between each count was the amount of drug involved. The applicant submitted that because the amounts of drug involved for counts 1, 2 and 5 were significantly less than for count 3 an error has occurred. 

11The Crown responded to this ground of appeal by emphasising that this Court is concerned with errors which have been previously described as ""material errors"". This expression was discussed by Latham J in Baxter v R (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 (especially [83]-[84]). The Crown accepts that the sentences for counts 2 and 5 are ""too high"" compared with the sentence for count 3 which was determined to be the most serious of the offences. However, it was submitted that, as the individual sentences for those counts are fully subsumed by the sentences imposed for other offences, the error is of such a technical nature that it could not have affected the sentencing discretion (see R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; 65 NSWLR 740 at [30]). 

12It was submitted that the position in relation to count 1 was similar although it was argued that for that count there was a discrete but short period of incarceration. I do not believe this to be correct. My understanding is that the sentence for count 1 is wholly subsumed in the sentence for other counts. 

13As it happens it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence. I will in that process re-sentence for the individual offences. It seems to me that his Honour intended that the fixed terms should represent the entire sentence for each of counts 1, 2 and 5. If the individual sentences are altered so that the fixed term is the non-parole period which would have been applicable to that sentence the individual sentences will be appropriate. As I discuss below I do not propose to alter the length of the total non-parole period or overall sentence. Apart from the submission made in relation to ground 3 it was not submitted that the total sentence was excessive. 

14The final ground of appeal was that the sentences received for counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 compared with the corresponding sentences received by the co-offender Adam Aiken were excessive. 

15The co-offender Adam Aiken was sentenced by the same judge. His Honour found Adam Aiken to be the ""head of the syndicate"" and its ""chief distributor"" while the applicant occupied the lower role of ""facilitator"". 

16The sentencing judge accordingly concluded that Adam Aiken should receive a more severe penalty than the applicant. His Honour reached this conclusion having regard to Adam's position in the hierarchy, the fact that he distributed a greater total quantity of drugs than the applicant, pleaded guilty to the more serious offences of commercial supply, pleaded guilty to additional offences and had a more serious criminal record. Adam Aiken was sentenced as follows: 

Count 1: supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (280g), taking into account a Form 1 schedule with a further 280g commercial supply of the same drug: non-parole period of 5 years with an additional term of 3 years; 
Count 2: supply of 161.6g of methylamphetamine: fixed term of 3 years; 
Count 3: supply of 164.4g of methylamphetamine, taking into account a Form 1 schedule with a further 7.1g supply of the same drug: fixed term of 3 years 6 months (the 164.4g supply is the subject of the applicant's count 3; the Form 1 matter is the subject of the applicant's count 8); 
Count 4: supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (362.6g), taking into account a Form 1 schedule with 3 further supply offences (27.24g of methylamphetamine, 3.5g of methylamphetamine, 14g of cannabis leaf) and a deal with proceeds of crime offence: non-parole period of 5 years with an additional term of 2 years 6 months (the three supply matters on the Form 1 are the subject of the applicant's counts 4, 8 and 9 respectively); 
Count 5: supply of 112g of methylamphetamine, taking into account a Form 1 schedule with a further 56g supply of the same drug; fixed term of 3 years 6 months (the 112g supply is the subject of the applicant's count 2; the Form 1 matter is the subject of the applicants count 1). 

17The total sentence for Adam Aiken was an effective non-parole period of 8 years with a total term of 11 years. 

18The applicant submitted that having regard to the principles discussed by the High Court in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at [301] he has a legitimate sense of grievance when the following comparisons are made: 

The applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 4 years for taking part in the 112g supply (count 2), while Adam Aiken was sentenced to a lower fixed term of 3 years and 6 months for the same supply (Adam's count 5). The disparity in this instance was said to be heightened by the circumstance that Adam's sentence took into account a Form 1 schedule which contained a further 56g supply (the applicant's count 1). 

The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years for taking part in the 164.4g supply (count 3) while Adam was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years and 6 months for the same supply (Adam's count 3). Adam's sentence took into account a Form 1 schedule which contained a further 7.1g supply (the applicant's count 8). Although Adam's fixed term was marginally higher than the applicant's non-parole period, it was submitted that due allowance was not made for the findings concerning the co-offender's more serious criminality, leaving the applicant with a legitimate sense of grievance. 

The applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years 6 months for taking part in the 56g supply (count 1), while Adam was sentenced to fixed terms of the same duration for: (1) the more serious 112g supply (Adam's count 5), which took into account the same 56g supply on a Form 1 schedule; (2) the more serious 164.4g supply (Adam's count 3). 

The applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years for taking part in the 27.24g supply (count 5), while Adam was sentenced to a fixed term of the same duration for the more serious 161.6g supply (Adam's count 2). 

19It is apparent from the sentencing judge's remarks when he sentenced Adam Aiken that he was conscious of the parity principle. His Honour also makes plain that he was conscious of the differences between the two offenders, which included the manner in which each was charged. Because each offender was being sentenced in relation to multiple offences, but were co-offenders on only some but not all of the offences there is limited if any value in attempting to compare the sentences passed on each offender for the same offence. Considerations of totality will inevitably influence the individual sentences and the degree of concurrency and accumulation which may be appropriate. 

20I have already indicated that I propose to make adjustments to individual sentences. When those adjustments are made I am not persuaded that the differences in the sentences for each of the offenders is so marked or glaring as to justify the intervention of this Court. Although Adam Aiken's offending was, by reason of the quantity and number of offences, serious the applicant committed his offences whilst in custody for previous offences which significantly aggravated his offending. 

21The orders I propose are as follows: 
1. Grant leave to appeal. 
2. Uphold the appeal and quash the sentences imposed in the District Court. 
3. Sentence the applicant as follows: 

Count 7: a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 16 October 2008 and expiring on 15 April 2009. 
Count 6: a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 16 October 2008 and expiring on 15 October 2009. 
Count 1: a fixed term of 2 years 9 months commencing on 16 January 2009 and expiring on 15 October 2011. 
Count 2: a fixed term of 3 years commencing on 16 April 2009 and expiring on 15 April 2012. 
Count 5: a fixed term of 2 years 3 months commencing on 16 July 2010 and expiring on 15 October 2012. 
Count 3: having regard to the matters on the Form 1 a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 16 October 2010 and expiring on 15 October 2013 with an additional term of 2 years expiring on 15 October 2015. 
Count 8: a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 16 October 2010 and expiring on 15 October 2011. 
Count 9: a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 16 October 2010 and expiring on 15 April 2011.

2709189,Rotner v R [2011] NSWCCA 207,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Simpson J 

2SIMPSON J : This is an application, pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, for leave to appeal against an order of Judge Knox in the District Court made 15 June 2011, refusing an application by the applicant for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty entered by him to a charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (a charge brought under s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900). 

3The grounds of the proposed appeal are specified as: 

""1. His Honour erred in failing to apply the principles bearing on the application to withdraw the plea of guilty. 

2. His Honour erred in refusing to permit the applicant to rely on material tendered on the application in respect of the strength of the prosecution case against the applicant."" 

The background 

4The events giving rise to the charge against the applicant occurred on 10 April 2010. It is alleged by the prosecution that, in the early hours of that day (a Saturday), in an intoxicated state, the applicant encountered a Mr Jonathan Devery and Mr Devery's girlfriend (Ms Melissa Sanders). The first encounter occurred at a service station in Bondi Road, Bondi. Mr Devery and Ms Sanders had begun to walk to their home in Penkivil Street, Bondi from the service station, where they had purchased food. While they were still in the service station premises a motor vehicle, driven by the applicant, drove into the premises. It was very noisy. The applicant alighted from the vehicle, and spoke abusively to Mr Devery and Ms Sanders. Mr Devery's account of this incident is as follows. The applicant said: 

""What the fuck are you looking at cunt."" 

and 

""What the fuck are you looking at. I will kill you cunt ... I'll will [sic] hurt you. I will fuck you up ..."" 

Ms Sanders said: 

""Your car is shit, you are a dick fuck off leave us alone."" 

Mr Devery said: 

""I have had good night fuck off and leave us alone."" 

The applicant asked where they lived, and said to Ms Sanders: 

""Fuck off, slut."" 

5There then ensued some physical altercation, in which Ms Sanders grabbed the applicant around the chin, the applicant pushed her to the chest, Mr Devery stepped forward and told the applicant not to touch her again or he (Mr Devery) would push him back. The applicant again asked where they lived, to which Ms Sanders replied ""Penkivil Street"". The applicant said that he lived in the same street and would be waiting for them with some mates and: 

""I will kill. You are a dead cunt."" 

6The applicant returned to his vehicle and drove off into Bondi Road. Mr Devery and Ms Sanders continued to make their way home. The applicant returned to his home (in Penkivil Street) and obtained a knife from the kitchen. Mr Devery and Ms Sanders continued to make their way home, walking in the middle of the road. The applicant, accompanied by another man and a woman, jumped out from behind a car. He was holding the knife in his hand. He shouted: 

""I'll stab you and I'll kill you."" 

7Mr Devery told Ms Sanders to run to their apartment block and open the door. Ms Sanders attempted to do so, shouting at the applicant to ""Leave him (Mr Devery) alone"". 

8Mr Devery began to back away. The applicant shouted: 

""I am going to knife you."" 

He began to wave the knife around in the air, and then lunged towards Mr Devery with the knife at his chest and head areas. Mr Devery slipped backwards and fell onto the road, raised himself and began to run for the apartment block. Ms Sanders was having difficulty scanning her security card. The applicant approached and said: 

""I have got you now. You are dead."" 

9The applicant approached Mr Devery, waving the knife, striking him across his neck and chest. Mr Devery forced the applicant to the ground and punched him in the head. He (Mr Devery) was on top of the applicant. 

10Another man (Bradley Roland) pulled Mr Devery off the applicant, and held him for a short time. The applicant rose, still holding the knife. At some stage during this part of the events, the applicant used the knife to stab Mr Devery in the right shoulder. 

11The applicant was arrested at 3.35 am and taken to Bondi Police Station where he was charged. There is evidence that he participated in a lengthy (604 questions) interview, but this was not before the District Court nor before this Court. 

12On 14 April (Wednesday) Bradley Roland was arrested in relation to the attack. He participated in a lengthy interview that was electronically recorded. In the interview (to which it will be necessary to return) he gave a comprehensive account of the events of the early morning of 10 April, heavily implicating the applicant as the aggressor and the attacker. His account was largely consistent with the account given in statements by Mr Devery and Ms Sanders, although, as may be expected in the circumstances, there were some divergences and discrepancies. 

13After the interview, Mr Roland was released without charge. 

14The charge against the applicant was first listed at Central Local Court on 25 May 2010. The applicant was granted legal aid in respect of the charge. Initially, and up to the time he was committed for trial the applicant's matter was assigned to Ms Louise Sutherland, a solicitor employed by the Legal Aid Commission. On 24 May 2010, the Legal Aid Commission received a copy of the police brief. That brief did not include the video recording or the transcript of the interview with Mr Roland. It did include copies of witness statements made by Mr Devery and Ms Sanders. There was also (whether included in the initial brief or not is not clear) closed circuit television footage of the initial encounter at the service station. 

15At a relatively early stage, solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Commission made representations, on behalf of the applicant, to the Director of Public Prosecutions (""DPP"") enquiring whether he would accept a plea of guilty to a lesser charge. That approach was refused. 

16At some stage, a trial date was fixed for 11 April 2011. Early in 2011, after the applicant had been committed for trial, the matter was assigned to another solicitor in the employ of the Legal Aid Commission, Ms Joanne Harris. On or about 3 March 2011, the DPP provided Ms Harris with the video recording of the relevant interview. The content of the interview disturbed her. 

17Ms Harris had a number of conferences with the applicant, including one on 8 March 2011. At this time, she understood his instructions to be that he had no recollection of the actual altercation, and no recollection of his role in the events; his only recollection was of the actions of Mr Devery. Ms Harris confirmed with the applicant that the transcript of Mr Roland's interview had previously been read to the applicant. (The applicant had told her that he had difficulties reading.) She then played the video recording to him. She discussed with him the implications of Mr Roland's account, and advised the applicant that, if that account were accepted by a jury, his ""options had significantly narrowed"". She understood the applicant to instruct her (as she understood he had instructed Ms Sutherland) that he conceded wounding Mr Devery, although he had not intended to do so. (AB 340) This was notwithstanding that he professed to have no recollection; his concession was based upon an acceptance that ""nonetheless, he must have been responsible for the wounding"". Ms Harris formed the professional view that the only defence available on the instructions she had was to put the Crown to proof in relation to issues of intent. She considered the statements of the Crown witnesses to be ""largely consistent"" with one another. She did not consider a ""mental health defence"". She did not give consideration to a defence of self defence. This was because all accounts consistently indicated that the applicant was the aggressor. 

18Ms Harris had a further conversation with the applicant in which she advised him of what she perceived to be the strength of the prosecution case. Shortly after that she and the applicant were joined by counsel who had been briefed. At some stage the applicant's mother also joined the conference. 

19Ms Harris then gave the applicant advice concerning the maximum applicable penalty for the offence (imprisonment for 25 years), the prescribed non-parole period (7 years), and the availability of a reduction in sentence by reason of a plea of guilty, and gave the applicant ""pragmatic"" advice as to why he might choose to take that course. She prepared written instructions that she read to the applicant and invited him to sign, to enter a plea of guilty. The applicant signed the document the following day, in the company of another person she understood to have been a work colleague. The written instructions contained a reference to advice given to the applicant by Ms Harris that the prosecution case was ""overwhelming"" and that he would, in all likelihood, be convicted if the matter proceeded to trial. 

20Accordingly, on 11 March 2011, a plea of guilty was entered on the applicant's behalf. 

21On 20 April 2011, an application was filed by the applicant's present solicitors on his behalf, seeking leave to withdraw the plea of guilty, and an order that the matter proceed to trial ""by a single judge without jury"" pursuant to s 132A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Only the first of these orders was pursued. On the same day, the applicant's present solicitors wrote to the DPP; inter alia, they asserted that the applicant had been ""frightened"" by his legal advisors into pleading guilty. The letter, relevantly, read: 

""According to my instructions, Mr Rotner was frightened into pleading guilty by his legal advisor, in circumstances where a view had been formed of the evidence, which was entirely at odds with my view, and further, where alternative defences available to my client, including a possible mental health defence, was not canvassed with him. Finally, Mr Rotner clearly lacked consciousness of guilt, in that he could not remember the salient events which are alleged constitute the actus reus ."" 

22The application came before Knox DCJ, commencing on 14 June 2011. The evidence before the court included: 

correspondence between the various legal representatives and the DPP; 
two affidavits sworn by the applicant, on 22 April 2011 and 10 June 2011 respectively, the first of which annexed a neuropsychological assessment made in February 2011, when the applicant was aged 24, and after the charge. It also contained a good deal of argumentative material, as well as references to competing advice given to the applicant by Ms Harris and by his present solicitor. To the second affidavit was annexed a significant quantity of medical material, primarily concerning the applicant's level of intellectual functioning, consisting of historical material dating back to 1993, when he was a child; 
an affidavit sworn by Kelly Chau, which is immaterial to the present application; 

a copy of the transcript of the interview with Mr Roland; 
the written instructions given by the applicant to Ms Harris; 
pages 1 and 7 of seven pages of notes of the conference between the applicant and Ms Harris on 8 February 2011 (client legal privilege was claimed in respect of the remaining five pages); 
the brief of evidence provided to the Legal Aid Commission on 24 May 2010 (which did not include the Roland interview); 
an affidavit sworn by Ms Chrystalla Georgiou, a solicitor in the employ of the applicant's present solicitors. 

23Both Ms Harris and the applicant gave oral evidence. 

24Much of what was contained in this material has already been referred to. Some additional matters are worth mentioning. 

25The medical material annexed to the applicant's later affidavit dated back as far as 1993, when the applicant was six years of age. He was assessed as having a mild intellectual disability. His behaviour had caused concern, as being difficult to manage. A glancing reference was made to ""tantrums"". 

26The neuropsychological report annexed to the earlier affidavit gave a history of marijuana and alcohol abuse, blackouts at times of stress or worry, and an attempted suicide at age 18. The applicant was described as having ""an extremely poor ability to learn new verbal information"", and as having ""longstanding memory and learning difficulties"". 

27The two pages of conference notes obtained from the Legal Aid Commission file record the applicant as saying that he did not remember winding down his car window at the service station, nor saying to Mr Devery ""Don't fucking look at me, don't look at my car. What are you looking at""? He is recorded as saying that he did not know Mr Devery at all, but also as saying: 

""He is a lot bigger than me. I thought he was a tourist - I know all the locals. I don't remember if he had an accent."" 

He is also recorded as having acknowledged that he ""may have"" pushed Ms Sanders away. 

28The applicant's evidence in chief was brief, and was directed to what he knew of Mr Roland. He said that he was aware that, in 2011, Mr Roland was facing charges in Queensland, of assault and ""sexual harassment"" and that he was subject to bail conditions that required him to report to police in Sydney. When asked in cross-examination about his recollection of the events of 10 April, he said: 

""I don't recall having the knife or stabbing the dude, no ... I do remember being in an argument with someone but - but - "" (AB 55) 

29As to the plea of guilty, he said: 

""I pleaded guilty out of being afraid and rushed and not knowing what my legal - them telling me that I don't have a chance in trial ... and that's the exact words they gave me, that we won't have a chance ... I was afraid because I didn't understand what was going on and I don't recall having the knife."" 

30Of the advice he had been given, he said: 

""She [Ms Harris] did advise that she can go ahead with the trial but there's a very small - there's no way - there's not a way - there's not a way we could fight this trial for you, that you will lose this trial. She indicated we will lose the trial and that's why I pleaded, out of fear, and I didn't understand and I pleaded guilty because I didn't want to go to - I was scared because 7 to 10 years because she told me she couldn't - she wouldn't be able to fight properly for me."" 

31The applicant said repeatedly that he had entered the plea of guilty because he had been advised to do so, on the basis that the Crown case was very strong, and that a plea of guilty would be likely to achieve some reduction in sentence. 

32The interview with Mr Roland is of considerable significance. It is to be borne in mind that, at the time it was conducted, Mr Roland was himself believed to have been a co-offender, and was, in fact, under arrest. His account of the evening was as follows. He had been drinking at the applicant's home, which was in Penkivil Street. His said that at about 2.30 am, the applicant left the apartment, while he (Mr Roland) remained with the applicant's mother, and some friends. After a time, the applicant ran into the kitchen and grabbed ""what appeared to be a knife"", and ran out of the apartment, saying that he had been punched by somebody at the end of the street. Mr Roland followed the applicant, intending to bring him back. The applicant ran to the end of the street, where he became involved in what was then a pushing event with another man (who was taller and broader than the applicant). Mr Roland ran to where they were, grabbed the applicant, using his own body weight to move him about 20 metres away. He realised that the applicant had lost control. Still holding the applicant, Mr Roland shouted at Mr Devery to get away. Mr Devery walked towards them. Mr Roland shouted to him that he was trying to help him. He momentarily lost his hold on the applicant, who ""sprinted"" towards Mr Devery and Ms Sanders. Mr Devery and Ms Sanders walked into their address, but Ms Sanders had difficulty using her access key. 

33Mr Roland then described a physical altercation between the applicant and Mr Devery, in which, at one stage, Mr Devery was punching the applicant; however, Mr Roland said of that: 

"" ... it appeared that Daniel [the applicant] had striked [sic] the other guy on the should, and and then, and then the guy had and pushed like his bodyweight against Daniel and pushed him over a wall and into a bush and started, Daniel was in the bush and he started punching Daniel which appeared to be in, in the head, which, I, I do believe he, he did that, in his own defence 'cause Daniel did, was holding a knife."" (AB 167-8) 

34Later in the interview Mr Roland said: 

""He [the applicant] was, he, at that stage he did have, it appeared he had intentions of getting this guy and he was, mate, I'm not sure which hand the knife was in but at that stage I believe, that they were, he was striking, he was striking or they were pushing each other or, I don't know where the knife was then. I didn't, I didn't visual the knife. (AB 180) 

... --- and I wanted to grab him and pull away in defence of the guy. (AB 181) 

35He assented to a question: 

""So is it fair to say that [the applicant] was being the aggressive one? (AB 181) 

36He said: 

"" --- and so my visual of the actual stabbing wasn't that great."" (AB 182) 

37He said that the applicant chased Mr Devery and Ms Sanders up the stairs. He said that he did not see the actual stabbing. The following questions and answers are worth quoting in full: 

""Q 213: And can you describe me how he striked [sic] in the shoulder? 

A: With his right arm, more across rather than, rather than, yeah, in, yeah. 

Q 214: Was the knife in Daniel's hand at that time? 

A: Yeah, it was in his right, right hand. 

Q 215: So would it be fair to say that you saw him stab him at that stage? 

A: Yeah. (AB 183) 

38Finally, I extract the following questions and answers: 

""A: So I've grabbed him by the shirt, the guy, over the top of Daniel and, I, I, I pushed him over and, or pushed him away and, and that's, he's, he's moved. Yeah, that's how I grabbed him 

Q243: Did you do that in order to stop him from punching Daniel? 

A: Yes. 

Q 244: So out of defence for Daniel? 

A: Out of defence for Daniel, yeah. 

Q245: And would it also be out of defence for the victim because again, you didn't know where the knife was? 

A: It was out of defence for the victim as well because I didn't want to, then pushing him off to grab Daniel. Actually I want to go back all the way to when you said, Was Daniel the accused. He was the aggressor --- and he was most definitely the aggressor, I was hesitant to answer that question but he was definitely the aggressor --- and it was definitely clear that he wanted to, to get the guy --- and I, I definitely wanted to get Daniel away from the guy. (AB 186). 

39It is little wonder that this interview ""disturbed"" Ms Harris. 

40In her affidavit Ms Georgiou commented on material obtained on subpoena from NSW and Queensland Police authorities. This was with particular reference to any criminal history Mr Roland had in either state. As to the Queensland record, she made the following observations. (AB 225): 

""With respect to the document produced by the Queensland Commissioner of Police, I make the following observations by reference to Queensland Court Outcomes: Bradley Roland had three (3) offences finalised since providing his ERISP on 14 April, 2010 by Queensland Courts and on each of the three occasions, namely 5 October, 2010, 7 October, 2010 and 7 March, 2011, no convictions were recorded against him. I find these results surprising and unusual, particularly by reference to s 12 of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 (Qld), ... additionally, as at the time of providing his ERISP, Bradley Roland was facing serious charges of 'Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm (on 19 February, 2010), Possessing Dangerous Drugs (on 20 February 2010), Trespass, Entering or Remaining in Dwelling or Yard (on 2 March 2010) and Wilful Damage (on 2 March 2010)', as well as having been arrested with respect to an admitted assault on Jonathan Devery on 9 April 2010 (see question and answer 56 in the document marked as exhibit 10)."" (AB 226) 

41It is convenient here to refer to a discussion concerning evidence which took place at the commencement of the proceedings before Knox DCJ, in the course of the tender of documentary evidence. Although the discussion is wholly unenlightening, it appears to be the foundation for the second ground of the application. The transcript records the following (Mr Levitt is the solicitor who appeared for the applicant): 

""Levitt: Your Honour the only other matters are there are some documents produced on subpoena by the New South Wales and Queensland Police in relation to the only prosecution witness who claims to have seen the applicant commit the actus reus as it were. His criminal record has been produced by the New South Wales and Queensland Police; ... it would probably be overburdening your Honour to deal with that material at this stage, however, I would seek to tender it in the applicant's case, then to address on it in due course. It's not something that I can ask this witness [that was either Ms Harris or the applicant or both] anything about or any of the witnesses at all. But there are business records and pleadings your Honour ... 

It'll be relevant, all the submissions that I make, that I will be seeking to tender all that material in relation to the case for the applicant, but it's not a matter about which there can be any meaningful cross-examination of the applicant your Honour ... 

It goes to the strength of the prosecution case, whether the advice which he received from Joanne Harris about the threaten to prosecute case [sic - ? strength of the prosecution case] was appropriate in the circumstances and whether in fact the fact that this particular electronically recorded record of interview from Bradley Roland was served more than a year afterwards. On the heel of the hunt as it were, just on the eve of the - well after the committal and only picked up by the defence lawyers in Legal Aid from ---"" (AB 20-21) 

Knox DCJ replied in terms that expressed some doubt about the relevance of the material, but made no ruling on its admissibility. 

It will be necessary to return to this. 

42At the conclusion of the evidence Mr Levitt told Knox DCJ that the basis of the applicant was ""threefold"". The three bases he identified as: 


""want of consciousness of guilt""; 
""inappropriate legal advice, including disproportionate weight"" being given to the interview with Mr Roland, ""being told that it was an overwhelming Crown case with no reasonable prospects of defending the matter"", and failure to apprise the applicant of ""various defences"" available to him (he described the possible defences as self-defence, the absence of any direct evidence that it was the applicant who caused an injury with a knife to Mr Devery, and the possible effects of intoxication on the formation of specific intent); 
breach of prosecutorial duty (in the late service of the Roland interview). 

Mr Levitt made further reference (echoing the affidavit of Ms Georgiou to which I will return) to the favourable outcome of the Queensland charges Mr Roland faced. 

The judgment in the District Court 

43In a judgment delivered ex tempore on 15 June 2011, Knox DCJ refused the application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty. 

44In his judgment, Knox DCJ identified nine bases that he said had been advanced for the application. However, it seems to me, on proper analysis there were really only (at most) three bases. They were: 


the asserted inadequacy of the legal advice given to the applicant; 
that the plea of guilty was entered by the applicant, not out of a recognition of his guilt of the offence, but as a result of pressure, and fear of a possible term of imprisonment of seven years; 
that the applicant ""may be suffering from some form of mental disability which could affect his understanding of the issues and the advice he was given"". 

45The complaint about the legal advice given to the applicant had a number of strands. It was said that the applicant was ""misadvised"" or not properly apprised of all the relevant facts prior to the entry of the plea; that the applicant was not properly advised of weaknesses in the identification evidence; that the advice placed disproportionate weight on the significance of Mr Roland's accounts of the events in this interview; that the inadequacy of the advice was ""compounded"" by the late service by the prosecution of Mr Roland's interview; and that Ms Harris' advice that the Crown case was ""overwhelming"" was inappropriate, particularly in that she did not properly advise the applicant in respect of issues of specific intent, or other possible defences, such as self-defence. 

46His Honour reviewed the legal authorities to which his attention had been directed. He held: 

""I am not satisfied on the evidence that the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charge, nor that he had any other intention other than to admit his guilt. Nor do I think that he could not, in law, have been convicted of the offence as charged. There is no suggestion of involuntary actions by the applicant in the sense that there were inappropriate threats or other impropriety, nor any relevant mistake affecting the integrity of the plea. 

... 

The letter of instructions that he gave and the advice evident from it is unequivocal. I do not regard the evidence as showing that the applicant and his then advisors were not in possession of all the relevant facts ... I do not think that this was a case ... that there was not competent advice given ... (AB 111) 

... 

I am satisfied that [the applicant] entered the plea in the exercise of his free choice, with an accurate appreciation of the nature of the charge and to pursue what he thought were his interests. I do not consider that if the court was to act on the plea entered in this instance that there would be a miscarriage of justice."" (AB 114) 

The relevant legal principles 

47The principles upon which leave will be given to reverse a plea of guilty have been stated in various cases, with only slight variation in formulation, perhaps most succinctly in R v Kouroumalos [2000] NSWCCA 453. At [19] Wood CJ at CL said: 

""What is required, for an exercise of the relevant discretion is the identification of some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt or that otherwise the integrity of the plea is bona fide in question ..."" 

48That concept goes back at least to R v Murphy [1965] VR 187. In that case, Sholl J said, in a passage that has been widely quoted since: 

""I should be disposed to agree that if [the applicant] pleaded guilty through a misapprehension of the law, e.g. a misunderstanding of what she was pleading to, or what constituted the crime charged, or for some other reason which enabled one to say that her plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt, an issuable question of guilt would be sufficient to warrant the ordering of a new trial."" (p 191) 

49There are, in fact, two components to the test so stated - first, some circumstance that permits a conclusion that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt, and, second, an ""issuable"" question about the guilt of the applicant. Neither, alone, is sufficient. As I understand the test, it is necessary for the applicant to point to circumstances that created a doubt about his guilt, as well as circumstances that raise a doubt about his own perception, at the time he entered the plea, of his guilt. 

50It is unnecessary to refer to the statements of principle in the other cases in which the test has been applied. As I have said, they are all essentially similar. What is important, is some elaboration on the circumstances that might justify a conclusion that a plea of guilty was not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt. Wood CJ at CL identified some of these circumstances in [16] and [17] of Kouroumalos . At [16] he said: 

16. ""Before the Court will go behind a plea of guilty, and entertain an appeal against conviction, it must be satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred: Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 231. That may occur for example, where in offering a plea, the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charges, or did not intend to admit his or her guilt, or where the applicant, on the admitted facts, could not in law have been convicted of the offences charged: Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 121-122, and see also Foley (1963) 80 WN 726 and Caruso (1988) 37 A Crim R 1. 

17 It might also occur where an accused has entered a plea of guilty after a trial Judge has erroneously decided to admit evidence that would be fatal to the defence, as was the case in Chiron ; or where an accused is induced by threats from a fellow accused or police officer to plead guilty where otherwise he or she would have pleaded not guilty: Murphy ... or where an accused is persuaded to enter a plea of guilty by reason of imprudent and inappropriate advice tendered to him or her by legal representatives; Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320 and Whitehead [2000] NSWCCA 400, or by the Court: Davey NSWCCA 3 March 1995."" 

51Some of these circumstances identified by Wood CJ at CL have specific relevance to the arguments advanced on behalf of the present applicant. The applicant placed particular emphasis on the decision of this Court in R v Davies (1993) 19 MVR 481, to which I will return. 

52I turn now to the two pleaded grounds of the application. 

Ground 1: application of relevant principles 

53By this ground complaint is made about what is said to be the failure of Knox DCJ to apply correctly the principles I have outlined above. In written submissions, senior counsel for the applicant complained that Knox DCJ failed to consider that the integrity of the plea was in doubt on the basis that the plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt. He sought to demonstrate this by a three step process. The steps proposed were (I draw what follows from the written submissions, although in somewhat condensed form): 


that Knox DCJ determined the application on the basis that the applicant had no recollection of the critical event; 
that his Honour failed to consider whether, if the applicant had no such recollection, the plea of guilty was really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt; 
that his Honour focused on a different (and wrong) question - whether the decision to plead guilty was made ""in the exercise of a free choice, with an accurate appreciation of the nature of the charge and to pursue what he thought were his interests"". 

54It was argued that the focus upon the exercise of a free choice distracted his Honour's attention from the real question, which was whether the plea of guilty was properly attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt. 

55The submission does not do justice to the reasons given by Knox DCJ. His Honour quoted extensively from the statements of principle contained in various cases, particularly in Lawson v R [2011] NSWCCA 44, which, in turn, quoted from Kouroumalos the passages I have extracted above. Reference was also made to Liberti and R v Sargiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73. His Honour referred to other authorities, to the same effect. 

56He then said: 

""The relevant authority in Loury [ Loury v R [2010] NSWCCA 158] is that there must be a factor going to the integrity of the plea ... in my view I need to focus on the question of the integrity of the plea set against the background of all the material that I have referred to earlier."" 

57It is to be remembered that this was a judgment delivered ex tempore . Ex tempore judgments not infrequently lack the order and precision of language that can be incorporated into a judgment after the luxury of time for consideration, refinement of expression, and polishing. I detect in this ex tempore judgment no failure to appreciate or apply the proper principles. This complaint under ground 1 is unfounded. 

58Heavy reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Davies . This was a case in which the applicant had pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable driving causing death while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The plea was entered notwithstanding that the applicant had no recollection of whether or not he was the driver of the vehicle. He was convicted and sentenced and appealed, seeking leave to withdraw his plea of guilty. 

59The reliance placed upon Davies stemmed from the circumstance that that appellant, like the present applicant, had no recollection of the events giving rise to the charge. However, the crux of the decision was a body of evidence (of which the appellant was at the time of the plea ignorant) calling in question contrary evidence that he had been the driver. Of itself, lack of recollection was not the basis for the decision. In another passage that has been widely quoted, Badgery-Parker J (with whom Wood and Mathews JJ agreed) said: 

""If the integrity of the plea is bona fide questioned because it appears that the person who entered that plea was not in possession of all the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt, then in my opinion the plea of guilty ought be set aside and a new trial ordered if (but only if, and the onus lies upon the appellant) it is clear that there is, in the words of Sholl J [in Murphy ], 'an issuable question of guilt' - to put it more simply, there is a real question to be tried. If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction, and to order a new trial."" 

60The statement of principle in Davies is consistent with all other authorities; the application of those principles in that case depended upon circumstances not presently applicable. There is no body of evidence of which the applicant was ignorant which might call his guilt into question. 

61On behalf of the applicant, reliance was also placed upon the criticism of the legal advice given to him. Such a circumstance arose in R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97, where an accused pleaded guilty during the course of a trial, having heard apparently damning evidence given by a witness who happened to be his brother. His counsel strongly advised him to change his plea and seek to gain what benefit he could from doing so. All of this was done in some haste and under pressure. Subsequently, counsel revised his opinion and advised the appellant that the evidence was not as damning as he had originally thought. Wood CJ at CL again stated the principles, which he described as ""settled"". At [20], he said: 

"" ... the present appeal hinges upon three considerations: 

(a) whether the advice given to the appellant was or was not imprudent and inappropriate; 

(b) whether his plea was or was not attributable to a consciousness of guilt; and 

(c) whether the material before this Court shows that there is or there is not a real question about his guilt."" 

62The court accepted that the advice given under pressure to the appellant had been ""imprudent"" and ""inappropriate"". It also took into account that the appellant had continued to protest his innocence, and that he had accepted the advice given as being his best way to achieve the minimum sentence possible. 

63There is nothing in the present case to suggest that the advice given to the appellant was either imprudent or inappropriate. Ms Harris, in her evidence, gave cogent reasons for the pessimistic view she took of the applicant's prospects of success. In my opinion, her advice was plainly good and correct advice. 

64In my opinion this ground of appeal (if leave were granted) should fail. 

Ground 2: refusal to permit the applicant to rely on certain material 

65Ground 2 is even more difficult for the applicant. It is founded upon an assumption that is not clearly established on the materials before this Court. That assumption is that his Honour rejected evidence tendered on behalf of the applicant. That is why I have quoted above from the transcript of the commencement of the proceedings (see ** above). The applicant's legal representative made reference to ""some documents produced on subpoena"" but the transcript reveals no attempt to tender those documents at that time; I can find no (and this Court was referred to no) further attempt by the applicant's solicitor to tender that material. I acknowledge that in his judgment, his Honour appears to accept that a tender was made, but that in my opinion, overstates what can be read into the transcript. 

66In any event, the ground, even without that preliminary problem, is itself based upon a further misconception. On the hearing of the application in this Court, senior counsel informed the court that the material the subject of ground 2 was the criminal record of Mr Roland, which could, it was asserted, have been used to challenge his credibility, and thereby cast doubt upon the strength of the Crown case. Accordingly, on the hearing of this application, a document purporting to be the criminal record of Mr Roland was received in evidence. Initially, senior counsel described the record as ""lengthy"", and relied upon it as being of such significance as to be capable of giving rise to an inference that Mr Roland's evidence would or could not be accepted. 

67The document runs to three pages. On examination, it is a limited record indeed. It shows that Mr Roland was born in March 1989. In 2005, when he would have been 16 , he was found guilty in the Children's Court of assaulting a police officer in execution of duty, and resisting police officer in execution of duty, and of littering. This entry was repeated twice, giving an impression of a lengthier record than is the fact. Other entries concern warrants, but it is not clear to what they relate. In 2006, also in the Children's Court, Mr Roland was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and this entry, too, was repeated. That is the sum total of offences shown by this document to have been committed by Mr Roland. It is not, in my opinion, a record that could seriously call in question Mr Roland's veracity in his description of events the subject of the charge against the applicant. 

68The written submissions went further, however, and asserted that the proposed evidence raised questions concerning ""possible inducements to assist the authorities in relation to the applicant"". This may seem a little mysterious. However, it will be recalled that, in her affidavit, Ms Georgiou referred to documents produced by the Queensland Commissioner of Police, and observed that she found the results of charges against him in that State ""surprising and unusual"". 

69The only inference that can be drawn from this evidence of Ms Georgiou is a suggestion of gross impropriety on the part of Queensland judicial officers. Ms Georgiou gives not the slightest basis for making such a suggestion. It should not have been made. When taxed with providing an explanation for this evidence, senior counsel abandoned reliance upon it - quite properly so. 

70Ground 2 is without foundation. If leave were granted, it should fail. 

71Finally, it was put on behalf of the applicant that a possible defence of accident is available. This is a somewhat radical departure from the approach taken by senior counsel's predecessor, who proposed defences of inadequate identification or self-defence. 

72A defence of accidental stabbing is entirely inconsistent with the objective evidence. First, by reason of the applicant's professed lack of recollection, he could give no evidence of the circumstances in which the knife penetrated Mr Devery's shoulder. A trial judge would have not the slightest evidentiary basis on which to direct a jury of a possible acquittal on the basis of accident. Second, it hardly sits comfortably with the evidence that, on his first encounter with Mr Devery and Ms Sanders, the applicant was unarmed, but after a confrontation with them (instigated by him) he went to his home, armed himself with a knife, and went out into the street, apparently in their pursuit. In those circumstances a defence of accident would not have the slightest prospect of success. 

73There is no error exposed in the judgment of Knox DCJ. Even if some error were identifiable, I would be satisfied, for myself, that the applicant's plea of guilty was entered out of a true appreciation (based on sound legal advice) of the strength of the case against him, and an acceptance of his guilt, established by the overwhelming evidence against him, even in the absence of a recollection of what he did. 

74I would refuse leave to appeal. 

75FULLERTON J : I agree with Simpson J.
